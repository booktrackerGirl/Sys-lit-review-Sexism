Most of the research conducted so far on offensive language detection have addressed this task as a sole optimization objective. However, other linguistic phenomena that are arguably correlated with offensive language and therefore could be beneficial to recognize this type of problematic content on the Web, have not been explored in depth so far. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate whether explicit and implicit concepts involved in the expression of offensive language help in the detection of this phenomenon and how to incorporate these concepts in a computational system. We propose a multi-task learning approach that includes such concepts according to the relevance shown by a feature selection method called mutual information. Our experiments show that some phenomena such as constructiveness, target group and person, figurative language (sarcasm and mockery), insults, improper language, and emotions combined together help to optimize the offensive language detection task, outperforming a state-of-the-art method (the transformer BETO) that we use as our baseline to compare the results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Linguistic phenomena; Multi-task learning; Natural language processing; Offensive language; Spanish","Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Language detection; Language processing; Linguistic phenomena; Multitask learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Offensive languages; Optimisations; Spanish; Textual information; Learning systems","MCIU; FEDER; ERDF","Kogilavani, S., Malliga, S., Jaiabinaya, K., Malini, M., Manisha Kokila, M., Characterization and mechanical properties of offensive language taxonomy and detection techniques (2021) Mater.

To explore how current automated hate speech detection approaches perform in detecting this type of hate, we evaluated the performance of two state-of-the-art detection tools, HateSonar and Google’s Perspective API, on a balanced dataset of 300 tweets, half of which are examples of misogynoir and half of which are examples of supporting Black women and an imbalanced dataset of 3138 tweets of which 162 tweets are examples of misogynoir and 2976 tweets are examples of allyship tweets. We aim to determine if these tools flag these messages under any of their classifications of hateful speech (e.g. “hate speech”, “offensive language”, “toxicity” etc.). Close analysis of the classifications and errors shows that current hate speech detection tools are ineffective in detecting misogynoir. They lack sensitivity to context, which is an essential component for misogynoir detection. We found that tweets likely to be classified as hate speech explicitly reference racism or sexism or use profane or aggressive words. Subtle tweets without references to these topics are more challenging to classify. We find that the lack of sensitivity to context may make such tools not only ineffective but potentially harmful to Black women. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media","Social networking (online); 'current; Detection approach; Detection tools; Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media; Speech detection; Speech recognition",,"Bailey, A., On anger, silence, and epistemic injustice (2018) Royal Instit Philos Suppl, 84, pp. 93-115; Bailey, M., Trudy, R., On misogynoir: citation, erasure, and plagiarism (2018) Fem Med Stud, 18 (4), pp. 762-768; Barbour, R.S., Checklists for improving rigour in qualitative research: a case of the tail wagging the dog?

To combat this spread, this paper analyzes social media dialogue surrounding Proud Boys protests from multiple perspectives to understand: (i) the outlook and profiles of users who support and reject Proud Boys; (ii) the network structure to determine influencers and communities; and (iii) the degree of engagement of tweets and the activity of their authors. The analyses indicate that conservative, religious, right-wing segments of the populace support Proud Boys, and their support is rooted in patriotism and defense of American values. Socialists and progressives oppose their radical and hateful ideology. Proud Boys’ topic network is fragmented with low density and is comprised of distinct, small communities. Authors of opposing tweets have a more extensive set of friends and followers, and their tweets receive more likes and retweets. Based on these results, it can be inferred that tweets endorsing Proud Boys’ ideology do not appear to proliferate virally, but instead reach limited audiences through smaller clusters. These analyses and results then form the basis of a classification framework, which can accurately detect tweets supportive of Proud Boys with an accuracy of 0.84 and AUC ROC of 0.89. The capability of the framework to identify and demote supporting tweets offers an extra layer of mitigation that can be employed to stem their spread. The research showcases the promise of mining social media feeds to understand why and how radical extremism spreads and is a gateway for future researchers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Machine learning; Political ideology; Proud Boys; Radical extremism; Social media","Gateways (computer networks); Social networking (online); Case-studies; Machine-learning; Media content; Multiple perspectives; Paper analysis; Political ideologies; Proud boy; Radical extremism; Social media; Social media platforms; Machine learning",,"Abd-Elaal Ahmed, I.A., Badr, A.Z., Hani, M., Detecting violent radical accounts on twitter (2020) Int J Adv Comput Sci Appl, 11 (8), pp. 516-522; Ahmad, S., Asghar, M.Z., Alotaibi, F.M., Awan, I., Detection and classification of social media-based extremist affiliation using sentiment analysis techniques (2019) Human-Centric Comput Inform Sci, (24); Amrutha, B.R., Bindu, K.R., Detecting hate speech in tweets using different deep neural network architectures (2019) 2019 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems, pp. 923-926; (2020) Proud Boys’ Bigotry is on Full Display, , https://www.adl.org/blog/proud-boys-bigotry-is-on-full-display; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) J Stat Mech: Theory Exp; Buitinck, L., Louppe, G., Blondel, M., Pedregosa, F., Mueller, A., Grisel, O., Niculae, V., Varoquaux, G., Api design for machine learning software: Experiences from the scikit-learn project (2013) Proceeding of ECML PKDD Workshop: Languages for Data Mining and Machine Learning, 9, pp. 108-122; Cerbin, L., DeJesus, J., Warnken, J., Gokhale, S., Understanding the anti-mask debate on social media using machine learning techniques (2021) Int J Comput Appl, 28 (3), pp. 150-161; Congyu, W., Gerber, M.S., Forecasting civil unrest using social media and protest participation theory (2018) IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, 5 (1), pp. 82-94; Davis, J., Goadrich, M., The relationship between Precision-Recall and ROC curves (2006) In: International Conference on Machine Learning; DeCook, J.R., Memes and symbolic violence: #proudboys and the use of memes for propaganda and the construction of collective identity (2018) Learn, Media Technol, 43, pp. 485-504; (2018) Introduction to word embedding and word2vec., , https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec; Dreisbach, T., (2021) Conspiracy Charges Bring Proud boys’ History of Violence into Spotlight., , https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/, Accessed: 2020-01-21; Fahim, M., Swapnagokhale, S., Detecting offensive content on twitter during Proud Boys protests (2020) In: International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, pp. 1582-1587; (2021) Far-Right Proud Boys Move Portland Rally to the Former Vanport City, a Site Fraught with Racist History, , https://biturl.top/y6VRNf, Accessed: 2022-01-31; Far-right Proud Boys planned a rally in Clark Park (2021) West Philly Turned out in Force to Rebuke Them, , https://www.inquirer.com/news/proud-boys-philadelphia-clark-park-protest-20200919.html, September 2021.

Radical Islamist groups, in particular, have been profiting from the global appeal of YouTube to disseminate hate and jihadist propaganda. In this quantitative, data-driven study, we investigate the prevalence of religiously intolerant Arabic YouTube videos, the tendency of the platform to recommend such videos, and how these recommendations are affected by demographics and watch history. Based on our deep learning classifier developed to detect hateful videos and a large-scale dataset of over 350K videos, we find that Arabic videos targeting religious minorities are particularly prevalent in search results (30%) and first-level recommendations (21%), and that 15% of overall captured recommendations point to hateful videos. Our personalized audit experiments suggest that gender and religious identity can substantially affect the extent of exposure to hateful content. Our results contribute vital insights into the phenomenon of online radicalization and facilitate curbing online harmful content. © 2022 Owner/Author.","algorithmic audit; Arab HCI; detection; hate speech; Islamist radicalization; radicalization audit; YouTube recommendations","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Speech recognition; Algorithmic audit; Algorithmics; Arab HCI; Detection; Hate speech; Islamist radicalization; Personalizations; Radicalization audit; YouTube; Youtube recommendation; Large dataset",,"Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) 12th {USENIX} Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation ({OSDI}, 16, pp. 265-283; Agarwal, S., Sureka, A., A focused crawler for mining hate and extremism promoting videos on YouTube (2014) Proceedings of the 25th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media, pp. 294-296; Aggarwal, N., Agrawal, S., Sureka, A., Mining YouTube metadata for detecting privacy invading harassment and misdemeanor videos (2014) 2014 Twelfth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust, pp. 84-93; Al-Hassan, A., Al-Dossari, H., 2021.

Studies have shown that these individuals were more likely to develop mental health issues, likely due to being subjected to more forms of abuse on social media. Hence there is an ardent need to develop automated abusive speech detection systems to tackle the abusive content on social media. There has been an elevation in hate speech or abuse and this paper focuses on the LGBTQIA+ community. Due to the shortage of resources in the said study area, we hypothesize that data augmentation via Pseudolabeling by transliterating the code-mixed text to the parent language will improve the models’ performances on the newly constructed dataset. We put our hypothesis into testing, and studied the performances of several multilingual language models for our cause. © 2022 The Author(s)","Hate speech detection; Homophobia detection; Transphobia detection",,,"Anbukkarasi, S., Varadhaganapathy, S., Neural network-based error handler in natural language processing (2022) Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-10; Ashraf, N., Taha, M., Abd Elfattah, A., Nayel, H., NAYEL @LT-EDI-ACL2022: Homophobia/transphobia detection for equality, diversity, and inclusion using SVM (2022) Proceedings of the second workshop on language technology for equality, diversity and inclusion, pp. 287-290. , Association for Computational Linguistics Dublin, Ireland; Aswani, R., Kar, A.K., Ilavarasan, P.V., Experience: Managing misinformation in social media-insights for policymakers from twitter analytics (2019) J.

Players' coping strategies are limited to tools that focus on punishing toxic players (e.g., muting, blocking, reporting), which are inadequate and often misused. To address the needs of players experiencing toxicity, we took inspiration from research in other online spaces that provide support tools for targets of harassment. We iteratively designed and evaluated in-game tools to support targets of toxicity. While we found that most players prefer tools that explicitly address toxicity and increase feelings of control, we also found that tools that solely provide social or emotional support also decrease stress, increase feelings of control, and increase positive affect. Our findings suggest that players may benefit from variety in toxicity support tools that both explicitly address toxicity in the moment and help players cope after it has occurred. © 2022 ACM.","control; games; griefing; harassment; mood; report; support; toxic; toxicity","Coping strategies; Game; Griefing; Harassment; In-control; Mood; On-line games; Report; Support tool; Toxic; Toxicity","NSERC","Achterbosch, L., Miller, C., Vamplew, P., A taxonomy of griefer type by motivation in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (2017) Behaviour & Information Technology, 36 (8), pp. 846-860. , https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2017.1306109, Aug. 2017; Adinolf, S., Turkay, S., Toxic Behaviors in Esports Games: Player Perceptions and Coping Strategies (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play Companion Extended Abstracts (CHI PLAY '18 Extended Abstracts), pp. 365-372. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3270316.3271545, Association for Computing Machinery, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Affleck, W., Carmichael, V., Whitley, R., Men's Mental Health: Social Determinants and Implications for Services (2018) The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 63 (9), pp. 581-589. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743718762388, Sept. 2018; (2021) Hate is no game: Harassment and positive social experiences in online games 2021, , https://www.adl.org/hateisnogame; Ashktorab, Z., Vitak, J., Designing Cyberbullying Mitigation and Prevention Solutions through Participatory Design With Teenagers (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3895-3905. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858548, Association for Computing Machinery, San Jose, CA, USA; Brandtzæg, P.B.B., Skjuve, M., Dysthe, K.K.K., Følstad, A., When the Social Becomes Non-Human: Young People's Perception of Social Support in Chatbots (2021) Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21), pp. 1-13. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445318, Association for Computing Machinery, Yokohama, Japan; Ballard, M.E., Welch, K.M., Virtual Warfare: Cyberbullying and Cyber-Victimization in MMOG Play (2017) Games and Culture, 12 (5), pp. 466-491. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412015592473, July 2017; Baptista, M.N., Zanon, C., Why not seek therapy?

Schools and institutions remain closed and students’ screen time surged. The classes for the students are moved to the digital platform which leads to an increase in social media usage. Many children had become sufferers of cyber harassment which includes threatening comments on young students, sexual torture through a digital platform, people insulting one another, and the use of fake accounts to harass others. The rising effort on automated cyber harassment detection utilizes many AI-related components Natural language processing techniques and machine learning approaches. Though machine learning models using different algorithms fail to converge with higher accuracy, it is much more important to use significant natural language processes and efficient classifiers to detect cyberbullying comments on social media. In this proposed work, the lexical meaning of the text is analysed by the conventional scheme and the word order of the text is performed by the Fast Text model to improve the computational efficacy of the model. The intention of the text is analysed by various feature extraction methods. The score for intention detection is calculated using the frequency of words with a bully-victim participation score. Finally, the proposed model's performance is measured by different evaluation metrics which illustrate that the accuracy of the model is higher than many other existing classification methods. The error rate is lesser for the detection model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Buzzwords; Cyberbullying; Fast text; Insulting vocabulary; Intention detection; Natural language processing; Word2vec","Coronavirus; Fake detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Buzzword; Cyber bullying; Cyber-harassment; Fast text; Insulting vocabulary; Intention detection; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Word2vec; Students",,"Aguado, G., Julian, V., A multi-agent system for guiding users in on-line social environments (2019) Eng.

As a result, people from other demographic such as women and LGBTQ+ often encounter bias, sexism, and misogyny. Due to negative experiences, many women switch careers. Therefore, biases pose barriers to promote diversity and inclusion. To get benefits from diverse pools of talents and reduce the attrition rate of minorities, we need to identify the degree and effect of various biases and develop mitigation strategies. Therefore, my dissertation study aims at promoting diversity and inclusion among software development organizations by identifying the manifestation, magnitude, and frequency of various gender biases. For this purpose, I plan to investigate i) the effect of gender of the contributors in the code review process of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects, ii) the frequency of different dimensions of gender bias and their effect, and iii) develop a tool to identify sexist and misogynistic and derogatory (SMD) texts. © 2022 ACM.","diversity; FLOSS; gender bias; inclusion; misogyny; sexism","Open source software; Open systems; Attrition rate; Diversity; Free/Libre open source software; Gender bias; Misogyny; Mitigation strategy; Negative experiences; Open source communities; Sexism; Software development organizations; Software design",,"Alba, B., (2018) To achieve gender equality, we must first tackle our unconscious biases, , http://theconversation.com/to-achieve-gender-equality-we-mustfirst-tackle-our-unconscious-biases-92848; Anzovino, M., Fersini, E., Rosso, P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter (2018) International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64. , Springer; Ashcraft, C., McLain, B., Eger, E., Women in tech: The facts (2016) National Center for Women & Technology (NCWIT) Colorado; Basile, V., Di Maro, M., Croce, D., Passaro, L., Evalita 2020: Overview of the 7th evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for Italian (2020) 7th Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian, 2765. , Final Workshop, EVALITA 2020,.

Approximately one in four women are estimated to be or have been victims of severe violence at some point in their lives, irrespective of age, ethnicity, and economic status. Victims often report IPV experiences on social media, and automatic detection of such reports via machine learning may enable improved surveillance and targeted distribution of support and/or interventions for those in need. However, no artificial intelligence systems for automatic detection currently exists, and we attempted to address this research gap. We collected posts from Twitter using a list of IPV-related keywords, manually reviewed subsets of retrieved posts, and prepared annotation guidelines to categorize tweets into IPV-report or non-IPV-report. We annotated 6,348 tweets in total, with the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of 0.86 (Cohen's kappa) among 1,834 double-annotated tweets. The class distribution in the annotated dataset was highly imbalanced, with only 668 posts (∼11%) labeled as IPV-report. We then developed an effective natural language processing model to identify IPV-reporting tweets automatically. The developed model achieved classification F1-scores of 0.76 for the IPV-report class and 0.97 for the non-IPV-report class. We conducted post-classification analyses to determine the causes of system errors and to ensure that the system did not exhibit biases in its decision making, particularly with respect to race and gender. Our automatic model can be an essential component for a proactive social media-based intervention and support framework, while also aiding population-level surveillance and large-scale cohort studies. © 2022 The Authors","Domestic violence; Intimate partner violence; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Social media","Automation; Behavioral research; Decision making; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Automatic Detection; Automatic identification; Domestic violence; Intimate partner violence; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Social media; Machine learning","EU; IPRC","Smith, S.G., The national Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2015 Data Brief – Updated Release (2018), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta, GA; Campbell, J.C., Health consequences of intimate partner violence (2002) The lancet, 359 (9314), pp. 1331-1336; Capaldi, D.M., Knoble, N.B., Shortt, J.W., Kim, H.K., A systematic review of risk factors for intimate partner violence (2012) Partner abuse, 3 (2), pp. 231-280; Dillon, G., Hussain, R., Loxton, D., Rahman, S., (2013), 2013. , “Mental and physical health and intimate partner violence against women: a review of the literature,” International journal of family medicine; Karakurt, G., Koç, E., Çetinsaya, E.E., Ayluçtarhan, Z., Bolen, S., Meta-analysis and systematic review for the treatment of perpetrators of intimate partner violence (2019) Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 105, pp. 220-230; Cummings, E.M., Davies, P.T., Maternal depression and child development (1994) JCPP (J Child Psychol Psychiatry), 35 (1), pp. 73-122. , https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1994.tb01133.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed, [Online].

Automatic approaches using machine learning and natural language processing are helpful for detection. For such applications, amongst several different approaches, it is essential to investigate the systems’ robustness to deal with biases towards identity terms (gender, race, religion, for example). In this work, we analyse gender bias in different datasets and proposed a ensemble learning approach based on different feature spaces for hate speech detection with the aim that the model can learn from different abstractions of the problem, namely unintended bias evaluation metrics. We have used nine different feature spaces to train the pool of classifiers and evaluated our approach on a publicly available corpus, and our results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art solutions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Ensemble learning; Gender bias; Hate speech detection; Multi-features","Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Speech recognition; Ensemble learning; Feature space; Gender bias; Hate speech detection; Media outlets; Multifeatures; Online social medias; Social media; Social media platforms; Speech detection; Social networking (online)","CAPES","Agarwal, S., Chowdary, C.R., Combating hate speech using an adaptive ensemble learning model with a case study on COVID-19 (2021) Expert Systems with Applications, 185; Al-Azani, S., El-Alfy, E.-S.M., Using word embedding and ensemble learning for highly imbalanced data sentiment analysis in short arabic text (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 109, pp. 359-366; Al-Makhadmeh, Z., Tolba, A., Automatic hate speech detection using killer natural language processing optimizing ensemble deep learning approach (2019) Computing, 102 (2), pp. 501-522; Almatarneh, S., Gamallo, P., Pena, F.J.R., Alexeev, A., Supervised classifiers to identify hate speech on english and spanish tweets (2019) International conference on asian digital libraries, pp. 23-30. , Springer; Antonakaki, D., Fragopoulou, P., Ioannidis, S., A survey of Twitter research: Data model, graph structure, sentiment analysis and attacks (2021) Expert Systems with Applications, 164; Badjatiya, P., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Stereotypical bias removal for hate speech detection task using knowledge-based generalizations (2019) The world wide web conference, pp. 49-59. , ACM New York, NY, USA; Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Patti, V., Pardo, F.M.R., Rosso, P., Sanguinetti, M., Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter (2019) Proceedings of the 13th international workshop on semantic evaluation, pp. 54-63. , Association for Computational Linguistics Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., Enriching word vectors with subword information (2017) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146; Bolukbasi, T., Chang, K.-W., Zou, J.Y., Saligrama, V., Kalai, A., (2016), T.

However, these data biases frequently do not become apparent until after the models are deployed. Our work tackles this issue and enables the preemptive analysis of large-scale datasets. REvealing VIsual biaSEs (REVISE) is a tool that assists in the investigation of a visual dataset, surfacing potential biases along three dimensions: (1) object-based, (2) person-based, and (3) geography-based. Object-based biases relate to the size, context, or diversity of the depicted objects. Person-based metrics focus on analyzing the portrayal of people within the dataset. Geography-based analyses consider the representation of different geographic locations. These three dimensions are deeply intertwined in how they interact to bias a dataset, and REVISE sheds light on this; the responsibility then lies with the user to consider the cultural and historical context, and to determine which of the revealed biases may be problematic. The tool further assists the user by suggesting actionable steps that may be taken to mitigate the revealed biases. Overall, the key aim of our work is to tackle the machine learning bias problem early in the pipeline.

Driven by the importance of the issue, research in the automated detection of abusive language has witnessed growth and improvement. However, these detection models display a reliance on strongly indicative keywords, such as slurs and profanity. This means that they can falsely (1a) miss abuse without such keywords or (1b) flag non-abuse with such keywords, and that (2) they perform poorly on unseen data. Despite the recognition of these problems, gaps and inconsistencies remain in the literature. In this study, we analyse the impact of keywords from dataset construction to model behaviour in detail, with a focus on how models make mistakes on (1a) and (1b), and how (1a) and (1b) interact with (2). Through the analysis, we provide suggestions for future research to address all three problems. © 2022 The Author(s)","Abusive language; Hate speech; Social media; Text classification","Classification (of information); Text processing; Abusive language; Automated detection; Detection models; Hate speech; Modeling behaviour; Social impact; Social media; Text classification; Social networking (online)","NSFC; NKRDPC","Fortuna, P., Nunes, S., A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text (2018) ACM Comput.

Severe psychological traumas may occur in people who are exposed to this type of communication. It is important to develop automatic classification systems based on language models to examine social media content and distinguish homophobic discourse. This study aims to present a pre-trained Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (M-BERT) model that can successfully detect whether Turkish comments on social media contain homophobic or related hate comments (i.e., sexist, severe humiliation, and defecation expressions). Comments in the Homophobic-Abusive Turkish Comments (HATC) dataset were collected from Instagram to train the detection models. The HATC dataset was manually labeled at the sentence level and combined with the Abusive Turkish Comments (ATC) dataset that has developed in our previous study. The HATC dataset has been balanced using the resampling method and two forms of the dataset (i.e., resHATC and original HATC) were used in the experiments. Afterward, the M-BERT model was compared with DL-based models (i.e., Long-Short Term Memory, Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit), Traditional Machine Learning (TML) classifiers (i.e., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and Ensemble Classifiers (i.e., Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting) for the best model selection. The performance of the detection models was evaluated using F1-score, precision, and recall performance metrics. Results showed the best performance (homophobic F1-score: 82.64%, hateful F1-score: 91.75%, neutral F1-score: 96.08%, average F1-score: 90.15%) were achieved with the M-BERT model on the HATC dataset. The M-BERT detection model can increase the effectiveness of filters in detecting Turkish homophobic and related hate speech in social networks. It can be used to detect homophobic and related hate speech for different languages since the M-BERT model has multilingual pre-trained data. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The DW relies on independent servers (aka instances) that mesh together in a peer-to-peer fashion to deliver a range of services (e.g. micro-blogs, image sharing, video streaming). However, toxic content moderation in this decentralised context is challenging. This is because there is no central entity that can define toxicity, nor a large central pool of data that can be used to build universal classifiers. It is therefore unsurprising that there have been several high-profile cases of the DW being misused to coordinate and disseminate harmful material. Using a dataset of 9.9M posts from 117K users on Pleroma (a popular DW microblogging service), we quantify the presence of toxic content. We find that toxic content is prevalent and spreads rapidly between instances. We show that automating per-instance content moderation is challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data available and the effort required in labelling. We therefore propose and evaluate ModPair, a model sharing system that effectively detects toxic content, gaining an average per-instance macro-F1 score 0.89. © 2022 ACM.","Content moderation; Decentralised web; Pleroma; Toxicity analysis","World Wide Web; Content moderation; Decentralised; Decentralized web; Image sharing; Micro-blog; Model sharing; Peer-to-peer fashion; Pleroma; Toxicity analyse; Video-streaming; Toxicity","EPSRC","(2018) ActivityPub W3C Recommendation, , https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub; (2019) Decentralizedsocial Media Platform Mastodon Deals With An Infux Of Gab Users, , https://www.tsf.foundation/blog/decentralized-social-media-platform-mastodon-deals-with-an-influx-of-gab; (2021) Why Free Speech On-The Internet Isn't Free For All, , https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-19/why-free-speech-on-the-internet-isn-t-free-for-all-quicktake; (2022) Perspective API, , https://www.perspectiveapi.com; Ahn, Y.-Y., Han, S., Kwak, H., Moon, S., Jeong, H., Analysis of topological characteristics of huge online social networking services (2007) Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web., pp. 835-844; Almerekhi, H., Jansen, B.J., Kwak, H., Investigating toxicity across multiple Reddit communities, users, and moderators (2020) Companion proceedings of the web conference, 2020, pp. 294-298; Arhin, K., Baldini, I., Wei, D., Natesan Ramamurthy, K., Singh, M., (2021) Ground-Truth, Whose Truth?-Examining the Challenges with Annotating Toxic Text Datasets, , arXiv preprint, (2021); Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep Learning for Hate Speech Detection in Tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion (Perth, Australia) (WWW '17 Companion), pp. 759-760. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054223, International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE; Berger, A., Della Pietra, S.A., Della Pietra, V.J., A maximum entropy approach to natural language processing (1996) Computational Linguistics, 22 (1), pp. 39-71. , 1996; Bernstein, M., Monroy-Hernández, A., Harry, D., André, P., Panovich, K., Vargas, G., 4chan and/b: An Analysis of Anonymity and Ephemerality in a Large Online Community (2011) Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 5; Bianchi, F., Terragni, S., Hovy, D., (2020) Pre-Training is a Hot Topic: Contextualized Document Embeddings Improve Topic Coherence, , arXiv preprint, (2020); Bielenberg, A., Helm, L., Gentilucci, A., Stefanescu, D., Zhang, H., The growth of diaspora-a decentralized online social network in the wild (2012) 2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM workshops.

Hate speech is complex and multifaceted harmful or offensive content targeting individuals or groups. Existing literature reviews have generally focused on a particular category of hate speech, and to the best of our knowledge, no review has been dedicated to hate speech datasets. This paper systematically reviews textual hate speech detection systems and highlights their primary datasets, textual features, and machine learning models. The results of this literature review are integrated with content analysis, resulting in several themes for 138 relevant papers. This study shows several approaches that do not provide consistent results in various hate speech categories. The most dominant sets of methods combine more than one deep learning model. Moreover, the analysis of several hate speech datasets shows that many datasets are small in size and are not reliable for various tasks of hate speech detection. Therefore, this study provides the research community with insights and empirical evidence on the intrinsic properties of hate speech and helps communities identify topics for future work. © 2022 by the authors.

Due to the wide range of authorship attribution applications, a plethora of studies have been conducted for various Western, as well as Asian, languages. However, authorship attribution research in the Urdu language has just begun, although Urdu is widely acknowledged as a prominent South Asian language. Furthermore, the existing studies on authorship attribution in Urdu have addressed a considerably easier problem of having less than 20 candidate authors, which is far from the real-world settings. Therefore, the findings from these studies may not be applicable to the real-world settings. To that end, we have made three key contributions: First, we have developed a large authorship attribution corpus for Urdu, which is a low-resource language. The corpus is composed of over 2.6 million tokens and 21,938 news articles by 94 authors, which makes it a closer substitute to the real-world settings. Second, we have analyzed hundreds of stylometry features used in the literature to identify 194 features that are applicable to the Urdu language and developed a taxonomy of these features. Finally, we have performed 66 experiments using two heterogeneous datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of four traditional and three deep learning techniques. The experimental results show the following: (a) Our developed corpus is many folds larger than the existing corpora, and it is more challenging than its counterparts for the authorship attribution task, and (b) Convolutional Neutral Networks is the most effective technique, as it achieved a nearly perfect F1 score of 0.989 for an existing corpus and 0.910 for our newly developed corpus. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","authorship attribution; corpus generation; Low-resource languages; machine learning techniques; south asian languages; urdu","Deep learning; Asian languages; Authorship attribution; Corpus generation; Low resource languages; Machine learning techniques; News articles; Real world setting; South Asian languages; Urdu; Writing style; Learning algorithms",,"Abbasi, A., Chen, H., 2008.

The use of a convolutional neural network with an efficient decomposition strategy is explored to find the anomalous behavior of urban traffic flow data. The urban traffic flow data set is decomposed into similar clusters, each containing homogeneous data. The convolutional neural network is used for each data cluster. In this way, different models are trained, each learned from highly correlated data. A merging strategy is finally used to fuse the results of the obtained models. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, intensive experiments were conducted on urban traffic flow data. The results show that our system outperforms the competition on several accuracy criteria. © 2022 The Author(s)","Convolution neural network; Decomposition; Urban traffic flow data","Anomaly detection; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Traffic control; Anomaly identification; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Decomposition strategy; Efficient decomposition; Flow data; Intelligent transportation systems; Learning architectures; Urban traffic flow; Urban traffic flow data; Convolutional neural networks",,"Al-Khafajiy, M., Otoum, S., Baker, T., Asim, M., Maamar, Z., Aloqaily, M., Taylor, M., Randles, M., Intelligent control and security of fog resources in healthcare systems via a cognitive fog model (2020) ACM Trans.

In extreme cases, people can be heavily biased in favour of a political party at the same time that they are in sharp disagreement with others, which may lead to irrational decision making and can put people's lives at risk by ignoring certain recommendations from the authorities. Therefore, considering political ideology as a psychographic trait can improve political micro-targeting by helping public authorities and local governments to adopt better communication policies during crises. In this work, we explore the reliability of determining psychographic traits concerning political ideology. Our contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we release the PoliCorpus-2020, a dataset composed by Spanish politicians’ tweets posted in 2020. On the other hand, we conduct two authorship analysis tasks with the aforementioned dataset: an author profiling task to extract demographic and psychographic traits, and an authorship attribution task to determine the author of an anonymous text in the political domain. Both experiments are evaluated with several neural network architectures grounded on explainable linguistic features, statistical features, and state-of-the-art transformers. In addition, we test whether the neural network models can be transferred to detect the political ideology of citizens. Our results indicate that the linguistic features are good indicators for identifying fine-grained political affiliation, they boost the performance of neural network models when combined with embedding-based features, and they preserve relevant information when the models are tested with ordinary citizens. Besides, we found that lexical and morphosyntactic features are more effective on author profiling, whereas stylometric features are more effective in authorship attribution. © 2021 The Author(s)","Author profiling; Authorship analysis; Authorship attribution; Linguistic features; Natural language processing","Behavioral research; Decision making; Electric grounding; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Author profiling; Authorship analysis; Authorship attribution; Irrational decision makings; Linguistic features; Micro targeting; Neural network model; Political ideologies; Political parties; Public authorities; Linguistics","","Stachl, C., Pargent, F., Hilbert, S., Harari, G.M., Schoedel, R., Vaid, S., Gosling, S.D., Bühner, M., Personality research and assessment in the era of machine learning (2020) Euro.

It is important, therefore, to provide Information Retrieval systems with mechanisms to identify which results are legitimate and which ones are misleading. Our contribution for satire identification is twofold. On the one hand, we release the Spanish SatiCorpus 2021, a balanced dataset that contains satirical and non-satirical documents. On the other hand, we conduct an extensive evaluation of this dataset with linguistic features and embedding-based features. All feature sets are evaluated separately and combined using different strategies. Our best result is achieved with a combination of the linguistic features and BERT with an accuracy of 97.405%. Besides, we compare our proposal with existing datasets in Spanish regarding satire and irony. © 2022, The Author(s).","Feature engineering; Linguistic corpus; Natural language processing; Satire identification; Text classification",,"","Al Imran, A., Wahid, Z., Ahmed, T., Bnnet: a deep neural network for the identification of satire and fake Bangla news (2020) International conference on computational data and social networks, pp. 464-475. , Springer, Berlin; Apolinario-Arzube, Ó., García-Díaz, J.A., Medina-Moreira, J., Luna-Aveiga, H., Valencia-García, R., Comparing deep-learning architectures and traditional machine-learning approaches for satire identification in Spanish tweets (2020) Mathematics, 8 (11), p. 2075; Barbieri, F., Ronzano, F., Saggion, H., Is this tweet satirical?

It can have damaging physical and mental effects on the victims and hence, it needs to be tackled efficiently—several detection approaches are proposed in literature but those are mostly standalone. In this paper, we revisit the distributed and collaborative approach for detecting cyberbullying behavior using machine learning algorithms—a comprehensive enhancement of our past work—that uses many local and cloud-based collaborative configurations and different datasets. It contains a set of nodes, called detection nodes, which can identify cyberbullying employing Machine Learning classification algorithms and collaborate with each other as needed. Several experiments, consisting of various collaborative patterns, different scales, and failure scenarios, have been carried out using different Twitter© datasets in this study. The empirical results obtained from the experimentation show that the proposed approach is generic (i.e., allows the incorporation of different learning and collaborative techniques), and achieves better recall and precision values when compared with the stand-alone paradigm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cyberbullying; Machine learning algorithms; Twitter","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Classification algorithm; Cloud based collaborative; Collaborative approach; Collaborative detection; Collaborative patterns; Cyber bullying; Detection approach; Distributed approaches; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning classification; Computer crime",,"Hinduja, S., Patchin, J., Cyberbullying: neither an epidemic nor a rarity (2012) Eur.

Recent regulations are being discussed by U.K. representatives (“Online Safety Bill”) and by the European Commission, which plans on introducing Hate Speech as an “EU crime”. The recent legislation having passed in order to combat this kind of speech places the burden of identification on the hosting websites and often within a tight time frame (24 h in France and Germany). These constraints make automatic Hate Speech detection a very important topic for major social media platforms. However, recent literature on Hate Speech detection lacks a benchmarking system that can evaluate how different approaches compare against each other regarding the prediction made concerning different types of text (short snippets such as those present on Twitter, as well as lengthier fragments). This paper intended to deal with this issue and to take a step forward towards the standardization of testing for this type of natural language processing (NLP) application. Furthermore, this paper explored different transformer and LSTM-based models in order to evaluate the performance of multi-task and transfer learning models used for Hate Speech detection. Some of the results obtained in this paper surpassed the existing ones. The paper concluded that transformer-based models have the best performance on all studied Datasets. © 2022 by the authors.

On the one hand, hateful content creates an unsafe environment for certain members of society. On the other hand, manual moderation causes distress to content moderators, and the volume of harmful content is far beyond what human moderators can manually flag and react to. Thus, researchers in machine learning, social computing, and other areas have worked on developing tools to help automate the process. While initially studied as a text classification problem, over time, researchers realized that hate speech is multi-faceted and requires analysis of the role of linguistic expressions, context, and network structure, while using inspiration from psychology and user behavior, among others. With this in mind, we provide a holistic view of what the research community has explored so far, and what we believe are promising future research directions. © 2022 ACM.","Detection of hate; Hate speech; Network analysis; Psycho-linguistic analysis of hate speech; Spread of hate; User behavior","Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Linguistics; Speech recognition; Text processing; Content network; Detection of hate; Hate speech; Linguistic analysis; Linguistic expressions; Network psychology; Psycho-linguistic analyse of hate speech; Social media; Spread of hate; User behaviors; Speech",,"Alam, F., Shaar, S., Dalvi, F., Sajjad, H., Nikolov, A., Mubarak, H., Da San Martino, G., Nakov, P., Fighting the covid-19 infodemic: Modeling the perspective of journalists, fact-checkers, social media platforms, policy makers, and the society (2021) Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Emnlp 2021.

One form of social media abuse is misogyny utterance. Misogyny is hatred directed at women. The number of misogyny utterances on social media keeps increasing. Detection of misogyny needs to be done to prevent misogyny utterances. This work examines misogyny on Twitter and proposes a method to detect it. The dataset used comes from tweets on social media Twitter related to women. The experiment in this work was done by comparing the effect of BERT Embedding for Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory. The performance of the methods tested was evaluated based on the resulting accuracy. This work showed that BERT with LSTM surpassed other methods with 86.15% accuracy. The model could outperform other methods because it understands more about the context of the data. © 2022 IEEE.","bert embeddings; long short-term memory; misogyny detection","Brain; Convolutional neural networks; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Bert embedding; Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Freedom of speech; Logistics regressions; Misogyny detection; Performance; Social media; Speech detection; Embeddings",,"Sunarto, T., (2009) kekerasan, dan perempuan, , Jakarta: Penerbit Buku Kompas; Perempuan, K., (2021) Perempuan Dalam Himpitan Pandemi: Lonjakan Kekerasan Seksual, Kekerasan Siber, Perkawinan Anak, dan Keterbatasan Penanganan Ditengah Covid-19, , Catatan Tahunan; (2021) Siapa Tokoh Terpopuler di Twitter pada 2021?, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2021/07/09/siapa-tokoh-terpopuler-di-twitter-pada-2021; Caselli, T., Novielli, N., Patti, V., Rosso, P., (2018) EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian: Proceedings of the Final Workshop, , 12-13 December 2018, Naples.

They changed different aspects of human life, especially how people communicate and also how people access information. However, along with the important benefits, social media causes a number of significant challenges since they were introduced. Spreading of fake news and hate speech are among the most challenging issues which have attracted a lot of attention by researchers in past years. Different models based on natural language processing are developed to combat these phenomena and stop them in the early stages before mass spreading. Considering the difficulty of the task of automated harmful information detection (i.e., fake news and hate speech detection), every single step of the detection process could have a sensible impact on the performance of models. In this paper, we study the importance of word embedding on the overall performance of deep neural network architecture on the detection of fake news and hate speech on social media. We test various approaches for converting raw input text into vectors, from random weighting to state-of-the-art contextual word embedding models. In addition, to compare different word embedding approaches, we also analyze different strategies to get the vectors from contextual word embedding models (i.e., get the weights from the last layer, against averaging weights of the last layers). Our results show that XLNet embedding outperforms the other embedding approaches on both tasks related to harmful information identification. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Contextual word embedding; Fake news detection; Hate speech detection; Word embedding","Deep neural networks; Fake detection; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Contextual word embedding; Contextual words; Embeddings; Fake news detection; Hate speech detection; Information detection; Social media; Speech detection; Word embedding; Embeddings","BMBF","Asghari, H., Fatemi, O., Mohtaj, S., Faili, H., Rosso, P., On the use of word embedding for cross language plagiarism detection (2019) Intell.

The improvement is credited to promoting core features of the construct over spurious artifacts that happen to correlate with it. Yet, over-relying on core features may lead to unintended model bias. Especially, construct-driven CAD-perturbations of core features-may induce models to ignore the context in which core features are used. Here, we test models for sexism and hate speech detection on challenging data: non-hateful and nonsexist usage of identity and gendered terms. On these hard cases, models trained on CAD, especially construct-driven CAD, show higher false positive rates than models trained on the original, unperturbed data. Using a diverse set of CAD-construct-driven and construct-agnostic-reduces such unintended bias. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided design; Core features; Data perturbation; False positive rates; Model bias; Model robustness; Speech detection; Test models; Speech recognition","DFF","Atanasova, Pepa, Simonsen, Jakob Grue, Lioma, Christina, Augenstein, Isabelle, Fact Checking with Insufficient Evidence (2022) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL), p. 10. , to appear; Basile, Valerio, Bosco, Cristina, Fersini, Elisabetta, Nozza, Debora, Patti, Viviana, Manuel Rangel Pardo, Francisco, Rosso, Paolo, Sanguinetti, Manuela, SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter (2019) Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63. , Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

While Natural Language Processing has been successfully used for the purpose, many of the research efforts are directed toward the English language. This choice severely limits the classification power in non-English languages. In this paper, we test several learning frameworks for identifying hate speech in Italian text. We release HATE-ITA, a set of multilanguage models trained on a large set of English data and available Italian datasets. HATE-ITA performs better than mono-lingual models and seems to adapt well also on language-specific slurs. We believe our findings will encourage research in other mid-to-low resource communities and provide a valuable benchmarking tool for the Italian community. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Classification power; English languages; Language processing; Learning frameworks; Multilanguages; Natural languages; Non-English languages; Research efforts; Social media; Speech detection; Large dataset","H2020; ERC; ","Aluru, Sai Saketh, Mathew, Binny, Saha, Punyajoy, Mukherjee, Animesh, A deep dive into multilingual hate speech classification (2020) Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

The current research in Indonesian Twitter focuses on developing better hate speech detection models. However, there is limited study on the explainability aspects of hate speech detection. The research aims to explain issues that previous researchers have not detailed and attempt to answer the shortcomings of previous researchers. There are 13,169 tweets in the dataset with labels like ""hate speech"" and ""abusive language"". The dataset also provides binary labels on whether hate speech is directed to individual, group, religion, race, physical disability, and gender. In the research, classification is performed by using traditional machine learning models, and the predictions are evaluated using an Explainable AI model, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to allow users to comprehend why a tweet is regarded as a hateful message. Moreover, models that perform well in classification perceive incorrect words as contributing to hate speech. As a result, such models are unsuitable for deployment in the real world. In the investigation, the combination of XGBoost and logical LIME explanations produces the most logical results. The use of the Explainable AI model highlights the importance of choosing the ideal model while maintaining users trust in the deployed model. © 2022 CommIT Journal.

Multimedia automatic misogyny recognition consists of the identification of misogynous memes, taking advantage of both text and images as sources of information. The task will be organized around two main subtasks: Task A is a binary classification task, which should be identified either as misogynous or not misogynous. Task B is a multi-label classification task, in which the types of misogyny should be identified in potential overlapping categories, such as stereotype, shaming, objectification, and violence. In this paper, we proposed a system based on multitask learning for multi-modal misogynous detection in memes. Our system combined image features with text features to train a multi-label classification. The prediction results were obtained by the simple weighted average method of the results with different fusion models, and the results of Task A were corrected by Task B. Our system achieves a test accuracy of 0.755 on Task A (ranking 3rd on the final leaderboard) and the accuracy of 0.731 on Task B (ranking 1st on the final leaderboard). © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Character recognition; Classification (of information); Semantics; Text processing; Binary classification; Classification tasks; Combined images; Learning models; Multi-label classifications; Multi-modal; Multi-model fusion; Multitask learning; Sources of informations; Subtask; Learning systems","UPV","Bouazizi, Mondher, Ohtsuki, Tomoaki, Sarcasm detection in twitter: ""all your products are incredibly amazing!!!"" - are they really?

These memes although seemingly innocuous have transcended the boundary of online harassment against women and created an unwanted bias against them. To help alleviate this problem, we propose an early fusion model for the prediction and identification of misogynistic memes and their type in this paper for which we participated in SemEval-2022 Task 5. The model receives as input meme image with its text transcription with a target vector. Given that a key challenge with this task is the combination of different modalities to predict misogyny, our model relies on pre-trained contextual representations from different state-of-the-art transformer-based language models and pre-trained image pre-trained models to get an effective image representation. Our model achieved competitive results on both SubTask-A and SubTask-B with the other competing teams and significantly outperforms the baselines. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Semantics; Early fusion; Fusion model; Graph networks; Image representations; Language model; New forms; State of the art; Subtask; Target vectors; Image representation",,"Cer, Daniel, Yang, Yinfei, Kong, Sheng-yi, Hua, Nan, Limtiaco, Nicole, St. John, Rhomni, Constant, Noah, Kurzweil, Ray, Universal sentence encoder for English (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations, pp. 169-174. , Brussels, Belgium.

The challenge organizers provide an English meme dataset to develop and train systems for identifying and classifying misogynous memes. More precisely, the competition is separated into two sub-tasks: sub-task A asks for a binary decision as to whether a meme expresses misogyny, while sub-task B is to classify misogynous memes into the potentially overlapping sub-categories of stereotype, shaming, objectification, and violence. For our submission, we implement a new model fusion network and employ an ensemble learning approach for better performance. With this structure, we achieve a 0.755 macro-average F1-score (11th) in sub-task A and a 0.709 weighted-average F1-score (10th) in sub-task B. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Classification (of information); Binary decision; Ensemble learning; Ensemble learning approach; Ensemble systems; F1 scores; Modal models; Model fusion; Modeling architecture; Subtask; Train systems; Semantics","NRW","Chetty, Naganna, Alathur, Sreejith, Hate speech review in the context of online social networks (2018) Aggression and violent behavior, 40, pp. 108-118; Dosovitskiy, Alexey, Beyer, Lucas, Kolesnikov, Alexander, Weissenborn, Dirk, Zhai, Xiaohua, Unterthiner, Thomas, Dehghani, Mostafa, Gelly, Sylvain, (2020) An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale, , arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11929; Fersini, Elisabetta, Gasparini, Francesca, Rizzi, Giulia, Saibene, Aurora, Chulvi, Berta, Rosso, Paolo, Lees, Alyssa, Sorensen, Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification (2022) Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), , Association for Computational Linguistics; Gomes, Heitor Murilo, Barddal, Jean Paul, ­cio Enembreck, Fabrí, Bifet, Albert, A survey on ensemble learning for data stream classification (2017) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 50 (2), pp. 1-36; Huang, Gao, Li, Yixuan, Pleiss, Geoff, Liu, Zhuang, Hopcroft, John E., Weinberger, Kilian Q., Snapshot ensembles: Train 1, get M for free (2017) 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, , Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017, Conference Track Proceedings; Kiela, Douwe, Firooz, Hamed, Mohan, Aravind, Goswami, Vedanuj, Singh, Amanpreet, Ringshia, Pratik, Testuggine, Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes (2020) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624; Liu, Yinhan, Ott, Myle, Goyal, Naman, Du, Jingfei, Joshi, Mandar, Chen, Danqi, Levy, Omer, Stoyanov, Veselin, (2019) Roberta: A robustly optimized bert pretraining approach, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.11692; Loshchilov, I., Hutter, F., (2017) Decoupled weight decay regularization, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101; Lu, Zhibin, Du, Pan, Nie, Jian-Yun, VGCNBERT: augmenting BERT with graph embedding for text classification (2020) Advances in Information Retrieval, 12035, p. 369; Mann, H., Whitney, D., On a test of whether one of two random variables is stochastically larger than the other (1947) The annals of mathematical statistics, pp. 50-60; Onan, Aytug, Korukoglu, Serdar, Bulut, Hasan, Ensemble of keyword extraction methods and classifiers in text classification (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 57, pp. 232-247; Paszke, A., Gross, S., Massa, F., Lerer, A., Bradbury, J., Chanan, G., Killeen, T., Antiga, L., Pytorch: An imperative style, high-performance deep learning library (2019) Advances in neural information processing systems; Sabat, Benet Oriol, Ferrer, Cristian Canton, Giro-i Nieto, Xavier, (2019) Hate speech in pixels: Detection of offensive memes towards automatic moderation, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.02334; Simonyan, Karen, Zisserman, Andrew, (2014) Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1556; Torrey, Lisa, Shavlik, Jude, Transfer learning (2010) Handbook of research on machine learning applications and trends: algorithms, methods, and techniques, pp. 242-264. , IGI global; Vaswani, Ashish, Shazeer, Noam, Parmar, Niki, Uszkoreit, Jakob, Jones, Llion, Gomez, Aidan N, Kaiser, Lukasz, Polosukhin, Illia, Attention is all you need (2017) Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 5998-6008; Velickovic, Petar, Cucurull, Guillem, Casanova, Arantxa, Romero, Adriana, Lio, Pietro, Bengio, Yoshua, (2017) Graph attention networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10903; Wang, Ling, Zhang, Chengyun, Bai, Renren, Li, Jianjun, Duan, Hongliang, Heck reaction prediction using a transformer model based on a transfer learning strategy (2020) Chemical Communications, 56 (65), pp. 9368-9371; Xu, Kelvin, Ba, Jimmy, Kiros, Ryan, Cho, Kyunghyun, Courville, Aaron, Salakhutdinov, Ruslan, Zemel, Richard, Bengio, Yoshua, (2016) Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention; Yao, Liang, Mao, Chengsheng, Luo, Yuan, Graph convolutional networks for text classification (2019) Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, pp. 7370-7377. , 01, pages; Zhu, Ron, (2020) Enhance multimodal transformer with external label and in-domain pretrain: Hateful meme challenge winning solution, , arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.08290","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022",,181952,"English","SemEval - Int.

Misogyny detection, even though it plays an important part in hate-speech detection, has not received the same attention. In this paper, we describe our classification systems submitted to the SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification. The shared task aimed to identify misogynous content in a multi-modal setting by analysing meme images together with their textual captions. To this end, we propose two models based on the pre-trained UNITER model, one enhanced with an image sentiment classifier, whereas the second leverages a Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN). Additionally, we explore an ensemble using the aforementioned models. Our best model reaches an F1-score of 71.4% in Sub-task A and 67.3% for Sub-task B positioning our team in the upper third of the leaderboard.

First, we leverage on recently emerging Transformer models pre-trained (mostly in a self-supervised learning way) on massive data sets to obtain very effective visual (V) and language (L) features. In particular, we used the CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) model provided by OpenAI to obtain coherent V and L features and then simply used a logistic regression model to make binary predictions. Second, we emphasized more on data rather than tweaking models by following the data-centric AI principle.

They often appear to be amusing, evoking and attractive to audiences. However, some memes containing malicious content can be harmful to targeted groups. In this paper, we study misogynous meme detection, a shared task in SemEval 2022 - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI). The challenge of misogynous meme detection is to co-represent multi-modal features. To tackle with this challenge, we propose a Multi-modal Multi-task Variational AutoEncoder (MMVAE) to learn an effective co-representation of visual and textual features in the latent space. Our goal is to automatically determine if a meme contains misogynous information and then identify its fine-grained category. Our model achieves F1 scores of 0.723 on the MAMI sub-task A and 0.634 on sub-task B. We carry out comprehensive experiments on our model's architecture and show that our approach significantly outperforms several strong uni-modal and multi-modal approaches.

Specifically, we combine linguistic features with contextual transformers based on text (BERT) and images (BEiT). Besides, we also evaluate other ensemble learning strategies and the usage of non-contextual pretrained embeddings. Although our results are limited, we outperform all the baselines proposed, achieving position 36 in the binary classification task with a macro F1-score of 0.687, and position 28 in the multi-label task of misogynous categorisation, with an macro F1-score of 0.663. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Classification (of information); Semantics; Binary classification; Classification tasks; Embeddings; Ensemble learning; F1 scores; Features sets; Learning strategy; Linguistic features; Multi-modal; Neural-networks; Embeddings","","Anzovino, Maria, Fersini, Elisabetta, Rosso, Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter (2018) International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64. , Springer; Bao, Hangbo, Dong, Li, Wei, Furu, (2021) Beit: Bert pre-training of image transformers, , arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.08254; Bergstra, James, Yamins, Daniel, Cox, David, Making a science of model search: Hyperparameter optimization in hundreds of dimensions for vision architectures (2013) International conference on machine learning, pp. 115-123. , PMLR; Bosco, Cristina, 'Orletta Felice, Dell, Poletto, Fabio, Sanguinetti, Manuela, Maurizio, Tesconi, Overview of the evalita 2018 hate speech detection task (2018) EVALITA 2018-Sixth Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian, 2263, pp. 1-9. , pages CEUR; Dawkins, Richard, Davis, Nicola, (2017) The selfish gene, , Macat Library; ­a del Pilar Salas-Zárate, Marí, Alor-Hernández, Giner, Sánchez-Cervantes, Jose Luis, Paredes-Valverde, Mario Andres, Garcí­a-Alcaraz, Jorge Luis, Valencia-Garcí, Rafael, Review of english literature on figurative language applied to social networks (2020) Knowledge and Information Systems, 62 (6), pp. 2105-2137; Devlin, Jacob, Chang, Ming-Wei, Lee, Kenton, Toutanova, Kristina, BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2018) CoRR, , abs/1810.04805; Fersini, Elisabetta, Gasparini, Francesca, Rizzi, Giulia, Saibene, Aurora, Chulvi, Berta, Rosso, Paolo, Lees, Alyssa, Sorensen, Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification (2022) Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), , Association for Computational Linguistics; Fersini, Elisabetta, Rosso, Paolo, Anzovino, Maria, Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018 (2018) Ibereval@ sepln, 2150, pp. 214-228; Garcí­a-Dí­az, Jose Antonio, Cánovas-Garcí­a, Mar, Colomo-Palacios, Ricardo, Valencia-Garcí, Rafael, Detecting misogyny in spanish tweets. an approach based on linguistics features and word embeddings (2021) Future Generation Computer Systems, 114, pp. 506-518; Garcí­a-Dí­az, Jose Antonio, Colomo-Palacios, Ricardo, Valencia-Garcí, Rafael, Psychographic traits identification based on political ideology: An author analysis study on spanish politicians' tweets posted in 2020 (2022) Future Generation Computer Systems, 130, pp. 59-74; Garcí, Jose Antonio, Evaluating feature combination strategies for hate-speech detection in spanish using linguistic features and transformers (2022) Complex & Intelligent Systems, , a-Dí­az, Salud Marí­a Jimenez-Zafra, Miguel íngel Garcí­a-Cumbreras, and Rafael Valencia-Garcí­a. b; Garcí, Jose Antonio, Valencia-Garcí, Rafael, Compilation and evaluation of the spanish saticorpus 2021 for satire identification using linguistic features and transformers (2022) Complex & Intelligent Systems, pp. 1-14. , a-Dí­az and, a. pages; Joulin, Armand, Grave, Edouard, Bojanowski, Piotr, Douze, Matthijs, Jegou, Herve, Mikolov, Tomas, (2016) Fasttext. zip: Compressing text classification models, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.03651; Reimers, Nils, Gurevych, Iryna, Sentence-bert: Sentence embeddings using siamese bert-networks (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, , Association for Computational Linguistics; Risch, Julian, Stoll, Anke, Wilms, Lena, Wiegand, Michael, Overview of the germeval 2021 shared task on the identification of toxic, engaging, and fact-claiming comments (2021) Proceedings of the GermEval 2021 Shared Task on the Identification of Toxic, Engaging, and Fact-Claiming Comments, pp. 1-12; Rodrí­guez-Sánchez, Francisco, Carrillo-de Albornoz, Jorge, Plaza, Laura, Gonzalo, Julio, Rosso, Paolo, Comet, Miriam, Donoso, Trinidad, Overview of exist 2021: sexism identification in social networks (2021) Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural, 67, pp. 195-207","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022",,181952,"English","SemEval - Int.

This task is further divided into two sub-tasks: (A) Misogynous meme identification, where a meme should be categorized either as misogynous or not misogynous and (B) Categorizing these misogynous memes into potential overlapping subcategories. In this paper, we propose models leveraging task-specific pretraining with transfer learning on Visual Linguistic models. With our best performing models, we were able to achieve rank 5 th and 10 th on sub-tasks A and B respectively. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"'current; Linguistic Modelling; Model ensembles; Modeling task; Pre-training; Subtask; Transfer learning",,"Afridi, Tariq Habib, Alam, Aftab, Khan, Muhammad Numan, Khan, Jawad, Lee, Young-Koo, (2020) A multimodal memes classification: A survey and open research issues; Anderson, Peter, He, Xiaodong, Buehler, Chris, Teney, Damien, Johnson, Mark, Gould, Stephen, Zhang, Lei, (2018) Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering; Chen, Yen-Chun, Li, Linjie, Yu, Licheng, Kholy, Ahmed El, Ahmed, Faisal, Gan, Zhe, Cheng, Yu, Liu, Jingjing, (2020) Uniter: Universal image-text representation learning; Devlin, Jacob, Chang, Ming-Wei, Lee, Kenton, Toutanova, Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186. , Minneapolis, Minnesota.

However, to date very few multimodal systems have been leveraged for the detection of misogynistic memes. Recently, researchers have turned to contrastive learning solutions for a variety of problems. Most notably, OpenAI's CLIP model has served as an innovative solution for a variety of multimodal tasks. In this work, we experiment with contrastive learning to address the detection of misogynistic memes within the context of SemEval-2022 Task 5. Although our model does not achieve top results, these experiments provide important exploratory findings for this task.

The second model uses a RoBERTa classifier on the text transcriptions to additionally identify the type of problematic ideas the memes perpetuate.

We address the two tasks: Task A consists of identifying whether a meme is misogynous. If so, Task B attempts to identify its kind among shaming, stereotyping, objectification, and violence. Our approach combines a BERT Transformer with CLIP for the textual and visual representations. Both textual and visual encoders are fused in an early-fusion fashion through a Multimodal Bidirectional Transformer with unimodally pretrained components. Our official submissions obtain macro-averaged F1=0.727 in Task A (4th position out of 69 participants) and weighted F1=0.710 in Task B (4th position out of 42 participants). © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Early fusion; Fine grained; Multi-modal; Textual representation; Visual representations; Semantics","","Anderson, Peter, He, Xiaodong, Buehler, Chris, Teney, Damien, Johnson, Mark, Gould, Stephen, Zhang, Lei, (2018) Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering, , arXiv; Anzovino, Maria, Fersini, Elisabetta, Rosso, Paolo, Automatic Identification and Classification of Misogynistic Language on Twitter (2018) International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64. , Springer; Clark, Alex, (2015) Pillow (pil fork) documentation; Defazio, Aaron, Jelassi, Samy, (2021) Adaptivity without Compromise: A Momentumized, Adaptive, Dual Averaged Gradient Method for Stochastic Optimization, , arXiv; Devlin, Jacob, Chang, Ming-Wei, Lee, Kenton, Toutanova, Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186. , Minneapolis, MN.

Detecting online sexism and encouraging better behaviours in society is a fundamental duty since the Internet is not safe from many of the misconducts against women. This paper explores a proposal by the Multiaztertest team that combines Bert and Roberta to fight discrimination against women. The best approach developed by this team in Spanish to the sexism identification task is based on pre-trained xlm-roberta-large and it has been fine-tuned only on the provided sexism identification labels EXIST dataset obtaining an accuracy of 0.7744 in the test data. Moreover, in English, the system uses pre-trained roberta-large which has been fine-tuned only on the provided sexism categorization labels EXIST dataset obtaining an accuracy of 0.8023 in the test data. Regarding the sexism categorization task, the best approach is based on pre-trained BETO in Spanish and pre-trained roberta-large in English and both have been fine-tuned on the provided sexism categorization labels EXIST dataset obtaining a macro-average F-measure of 0.4867 and 0.5337 respectively in the test data. Overall, the results confirm that these challenging tasks have been reasonably well addressed by the proposed tools. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In order to address this problem, the sEXism Identification in Social neTworks (EXIST) challenge has been launched at IberLEF in 2021. In this international benchmark, sexism detection is formulated as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task with the aim to automatically identify sexism in social media content (binary classification) and to classify statements into different categories such as dominance, stereotyping or objectification. In this paper we present the contribution of team AIT_FHSTP for the EXIST challenge at IberLEF in 2022. To solve the two related tasks we applied two multilingual transformer models, one based on a multilingual BERT and one based on an XLM-RoBERTa architecture, and a monolingual (English) T5 model. Our approach uses two different strategies to adapt the transformers to the detection of sexist content: first, unsupervised pre-training with additional data and second, supervised fine-tuning with additional as well as augmented data. For both tasks the XLM-RoBERTa model, which applies a combination of the two strategies, outperforms the other two models. The best run for the binary classification (task 1) achieves a macro F1-score of 74.96% and scores the 26tℎ rank in the benchmark; for the multi-class classification (task 2) our best submission scores the 13tℎ rank with a macro F1-score of 46.75%. © 2022 2022 for this paper by its authors.

It is a challenge formed of two tasks, aimed at identifying and categorizing sexism in texts, respectively. First of all, a review of language models in Spanish and English is carried out, identifying the best performing models in each language. Also, a review of similar tasks and challenges (sexism detection in texts) is done. Then, models are trained in two phases. The first phase is for selecting the best hyperparameters for each model, while in the second phase these hyperparameters are used to learn with more training data. Finally, a simple ensembling strategy is used, which takes into account the performance of each model over a small validation set. This is compared against building a pure Transformers Ensemble, showing that the simple ensembling strategy obtains higher results. This leaves for future work the task of making such Ensembles work at least as good as the naive ensembling strategy. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Some characteristics such as sarcasm and multiple forms of sexism increase the difficulty of detecting and identifying this type of content. Nevertheless, it is essential to improve prediction quality to improve decision-making such as post removal, and user ban, among others. The main objective of this work is to propose a methodology and explore the use of different transformers architectures for two tasks in English and Spanish: sexism detection and sexism classification. Single-language and multilingual versions of the BERT, RoBERTa, and single-language versions of the Electra, and GPT2 architectures were evaluated on the EXIST 2022 shared task challenge at IberLEF 2022 dataset. It was observed that: (i) the use of the translation of the posts to English and then using single-language English and multilingual models present the best results; (ii) the best architectures were BERT and RoBERTa; (iii) using single-language Spanish models provided the worst results; (iv) sexism classification was more difficult than sexism detection; and (v) the use of ensembles were better than the GPT2 and Electra models, but worse than English single-language generally and multilingual models. An in-depth hyperparameters analysis was also conducted. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The task has been organised in two related sub-tasks: the first one is focused on recognising whether a meme is misogynous or not (Sub-task A), while the second one is devoted to recognising types of misogyny (Sub-task B). MAMI has been one of the most popular tasks at SemEval-2022 with more than 400 participants, 65 teams involved in Sub-task A and 41 in Sub-task B from 13 countries.

This shared task is focused on mentions of violent events in Spanish tweets, and proposes two subtasks: first, detecting whether a violent incident is mentioned in a tweet; and, second, determining which type of violent event is being mentioned. We participated in this shared task with multiple systems built on Transformer-based models, which we fine-tuned on different versions of the provided data. Among others, we explored the impact of automatic data augmentation and relabelling. Further, we tested masking keywords during training as a means to avoid the models from overfitting these recurrent expressions. Our systems ranked in 2nd place in both tasks, with F1-scores of 77.32 and 52.86 respectively. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

We apply transfer learning from a pre-trained multilingual DeBERTa (mDeBERTa) model and its zero classification to gain a better performance than BERT-based approaches. Lastly, we combine all 3 methods: mDeBERTa, zero classification, and BERT for majority vote. For Task 1, mDeBERTa is the best method with an accuracy of 76.09% and F1 of 76.08%. Meanwhile, an accuracy of 66.26% and F1 of 47.06% are the best results in Task2, when using majority vote. Our main contribution is to use DeBERTa and zero classification with designing only one classifier in sexism identification. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

We study two strategies to improve the results from last year's competition systems. First, we try to expand the criteria for the models to learn by augmenting the training examples via back-translation, whereas in the second approach, we augment the criteria at the classification stage by ensembling models pre-trained and fine-tuned over different languages. As a common step, we augment the training data by incorporating some examples where sexism is reinforced with hateful and/or offensive language and others examples where it is disguised by humor. Experimental results show that ensembling the prediction of different classifiers yields better results for sexism detection and classification tasks. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Our main contribution is to show the effectiveness of using an ensemble of classifiers based on transformers. In our experiments for Task 1 we tested several models and decided to ensemble the three models that provided the best F1 score for this dataset. We achieved an accuracy of 78.83% for Task 1, ranking our run for Task 1 in the 6th place of the competition. For Task 2 we have used a hierarchical classification approach. First, a binary classification is performed to detect non-sexist tweets and then transformer-based models were used to categorize sexist tweets into the five proposed categories. For this task our system reached an accuracy of 64,65%, ranking in 11th place of the competition. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In the case of sarcasm, a more aggressive type of irony, the intent is to mock or scorn a victim without excluding the possibility to hurt. Stereotypes are often used, especially in discussions about controversial issues such as immigration, sexism, and misogyny. Regarding PAN’s open submission toward tackling this issue, we use BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) as a way to identify ironic and sarcastic phrases from genuine ones in Twitter posts. Since the goal is to detect irony in texts published on social media, and usually social media users have a different writing style and their texts contain a variety of nonstandard language expressions, the input texts are deep cleaned before feeding into the BERT network. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the accuracy and training loss ratio of the BERT network by applying deep cleaning to input texts. Thus, we achieved up to 98.5 percent accuracy with the proposed method. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Author Profiling; BERT; Irony Detection; Stereotypes; Text Cleaning","Social networking (online); Author profiling; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Irony detection; Loss ratio; Social media; Stereotype; Text cleaning; Twitter posts; Writing style; Cleaning",,"Curcó, Carmen, Irony: Negation, Echo, and Metarepresentation (2007) Irony in Language and Thought, pp. 269-296. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00041-8; Grice, H.

Transformer-based Natural Language Processing models have become the standard for hate speech detection. However, the unconscious use of these techniques for such a critical task comes with negative consequences. Various works have demonstrated that hate speech classifiers are biased. These findings have prompted efforts to explain classifiers, mainly using attribution methods. In this paper, we provide the first benchmark study of interpretability approaches for hate speech detection. We cover four post-hoc token attribution approaches to explain the predictions of Transformer-based misogyny classifiers in English and Italian. Further, we compare generated attributions to attention analysis. We find that only two algorithms provide faithful explanations aligned with human expectations. Gradient-based methods and attention, however, show inconsistent outputs, making their value for explanations questionable for hate speech detection tasks. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Benchmark study; Critical tasks; Detection tasks; Gradient-based method; Interpretability; Language processing; Natural languages; Processing model; Speech detection; Speech recognition","H2020; POLITO; ERC; ","Atanasova, Pepa, Simonsen, Jakob Grue, Lioma, Christina, Augenstein, Isabelle, A diagnostic study of explainability techniques for text classification (2020) Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 3256-3274. , Online.

Hateful contents may be expressed through popular communication tools, like memes. A meme is an image characterised by a pictorial content with an overlaying text introduced a posteriori, and its main aim is originally to be funny and/or ironic. However, the use of memes to convey misogynous messages has increased and thus an automatic detection of these contents seems to be necessary to counteract this phenomenon. This task is particularly challenging, having that (1) different memes can present the same image, but different texts and vice versa, (2) two memes with the same image but different texts can convey a misogynous and not misogynous message, respectively, (3) misogyny can be expressed by image alone, text alone or their combination. In this paper both unimodal and multimodal approaches are investigated whose classifiers are trained and tested on a dataset of in the wild memes, which present both experts and perceived labels. The proposed multimodal approach provides better results compared to the unimodal ones and the VisualBERT state-of-the-art benchmark. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Image processing; Memes; Misogyny detection; Multimodal classifier; Natural language processing","Classification (of information); Natural language processing systems; Images processing; Language processing; Meme; Misogyny detection; Multi-modal approach; Multimodal classifiers; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Social media platforms; Unimodal; Image classification",,"Afridi, T.H., Alam, A., Khan, M.N., Khan, J., Lee, Y.K., A multimodal memes classification: A survey and open research issues (2020) The Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Smart City Applications, pp. 1451-1466. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-66840-2109, Springer; Anzovino, M., Fersini, E., Rosso, P.: Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter.

In this paper, we present a new multilingual hate speech analysis dataset for English, Hindi, Arabic, French, German and Spanish languages for multiple domains across hate speech - Abuse, Racism, Sexism, Religious Hate and Extremism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of identifying various types of hate speech in these five wide domains in these six languages. In this work, we describe how we created the dataset, created annotations at high level and low level for different domains and how we use it to test the current state-of-the-art multilingual and multitask learning approaches. We evaluate our dataset in various monolingual, cross-lingual and machine translation classification settings and compare it against open source English datasets that we aggregated and merged for this task. Then we discuss how this approach can be used to create large scale hate-speech datasets and how to leverage our annotations in order to improve hate speech detection and classification in general. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The consequences of hate-speech are devastating, causing severe depression and even leading people to commit suicide. Hate-speech identification is challenging as the large amount of daily publications makes it impossible to review every comment by hand. Moreover, hate-speech is also spread by hoaxes that requires language and context understanding. With the aim of reducing the number of comments that should be reviewed by experts, or even for the development of autonomous systems, the automatic identification of hate-speech has gained academic relevance. However, the reliability of automatic approaches is still limited specifically in languages other than English, in which some of the state-of-the-art techniques have not been analyzed in detail. In this work, we examine which features are most effective in identifying hate-speech in Spanish and how these features can be combined to develop more accurate systems. In addition, we characterize the language present in each type of hate-speech by means of explainable linguistic features and compare our results with state-of-the-art approaches. Our research indicates that combining linguistic features and transformers by means of knowledge integration outperforms current solutions regarding hate-speech identification in Spanish. © 2022, The Author(s).","Feature engineering; Hate-speech; Knowledge integration; Natural language processing; Text classification",,"ERDF","Albadi, N., Kurdi, M., Mishra, S., Are they our brothers?

The impact of comments has been investigated in several studies. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are just a few of the social media networks that are used to broadcast different news worldwide. In this paper, a comprehensive AI-based study is presented to automatically detect the Arabic text misogyny and sarcasm in binary and multiclass scenarios. The key of the proposed AI approach is to distinguish various topics of misogyny and sarcasm from Arabic tweets in social media networks. A comprehensive study is achieved for detecting both misogyny and sarcasm via adopting seven state-of-the-art NLP classifiers: ARABERT, PAC, LRC, RFC, LSVC, DTC, and KNNC. To fine tune, validate, and evaluate all of these techniques, two Arabic tweets datasets (i.e., misogyny and Abu Farah datasets) are used. For the experimental study, two scenarios are proposed for each case study (misogyny or sarcasm): binary and multiclass problems. For misogyny detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT classifier with 91.0% for binary classification scenario and 89.0% for the multiclass scenario. For sarcasm detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT as well with 88% for binary classification scenario and 77.0% for the multiclass scenario. The proposed method appears to be effective in detecting misogyny and sarcasm in social media platforms with suggesting AraBERT as a superior state-of-the-art deep learning classifier. © 2022 Abdullah Y.

Thanks to the different existing techniques in natural language processing, it is possible to generate predictive models that automatically classify texts into different categories. However, a weakness has been detected concerning the language used to train such models. This work aimed to develop a predictive model based on BERT, capable of detecting racist and xenophobic messages in tweets written in Spanish. A comparison was made with different Deep Learning models. A total of five predictive models were developed, two based on BERT and three using other deep learning techniques, CNN, LSTM and a model combining CNN + LSTM techniques. After exhaustively analyzing the results obtained by the different models, it was found that the one that got the best metrics was BETO, a BERT-based model trained only with texts written in Spanish. The results of our study show that the BETO model achieves a precision of 85.22% compared to the 82.00% precision of the mBERT model. The rest of the models obtained between 79.34% and 80.48% precision. On this basis, it has been possible to justify the vital importance of developing native transfer learning models for solving Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems in Spanish.

Several studies have been recently published investigating methods to detect the various forms of such content (e.g., hate speech, cyberbullying, and cyberaggression). The clear majority of these studies deal with English partially because most annotated datasets available contain English data. In this article, we take advantage of available English datasets by applying cross-lingual contextual word embeddings and transfer learning to make predictions in low-resource languages. We project predictions on comparable data in Arabic, Bengali, Danish, Greek, Hindi, Spanish, and Turkish. We report results of 0.8415 F1 macro for Bengali in TRAC-2 shared task [23], 0.8532 F1 macro for Danish and 0.8701 F1 macro for Greek in OffensEval 2020 [58], 0.8568 F1 macro for Hindi in HASOC 2019 shared task [27], and 0.7513 F1 macro for Spanish in in SemEval-2019 Task 5 (HatEval) [7], showing that our approach compares favorably to the best systems submitted to recent shared tasks on these three languages. Additionally, we report competitive performance on Arabic and Turkish using the training and development sets of OffensEval 2020 shared task. The results for all languages confirm the robustness of cross-lingual contextual embeddings and transfer learning for this task. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, detecting hatred and abuse in low-resource languages is a non-trivial challenge. The lack of sufficient labeled data in low-resource languages and inconsistent generalization ability of transformer-based multilingual pre-trained language models for typologically diverse languages make these models inefficient in some cases. We propose a meta learning-based approach to study the problem of few-shot hate speech and offensive language detection in low-resource languages that will allow hateful or offensive content to be predicted by only observing a few labeled data items in a specific target language. We investigate the feasibility of applying a meta learning approach in cross-lingual few-shot hate speech detection by leveraging two meta learning models based on optimization-based and metric-based (MAML and Proto-MAML) methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort of this kind. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider hate speech and offensive language detection as two separate tasks and make two diverse collections of different publicly available datasets comprising 15 datasets across 8 languages for hate speech and 6 datasets across 6 languages for offensive language. Our experiments show that meta learning-based models outperform transfer learning-based models in a majority of cases, and that Proto-MAML is the best performing model, as it can quickly generalize and adapt to new languages with only a few labeled data points (generally, 16 samples per class yields an effective performance) to identify hateful or offensive content. © 2013 IEEE.","cross-lingual classification; few-shot learning; Hate speech; meta learning; offensive language; transfer learning; XLM-RoBERTa","Speech recognition; Cross-lingual; Cross-lingual classification; Few-shot learning; Hate speech; Language detection; Low resource languages; Metalearning; Offensive languages; Transfer learning; XLM-RoBERTa; Speech",,"Waseem, Z., Hovy, D., Hateful symbols or hateful people?

Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) enables a better understanding of context by learning the future time steps in a bidirectional manner. Moreover, GRU deploys reset and update gates in the hidden layer, which is computationally more efficient than a conventional LSTM. This paper proposes an efficient network model based on deep BLSTM-GRU for ciphertext classification aiming to mark the category to which the ciphertext belongs. The proposed model performance was evaluated using well-known evaluation metrics on two publicly available datasets encrypted with various classical cipher methods and performance was compared against one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and various other deep learning-based approaches. The experimental results showed that the BLSTM-GRU cell unit network model achieved a high classification accuracy of up to 95.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an RNN-based model has been applied for the ciphertext classification. © 2013 IEEE.","1D-convolutional neural networks; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Ciphertext classification; Gated recurrent unit; Recurrent neural networks","Brain; Convolution; Cryptography; Job analysis; 1d-convolutional neural network; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Cipher; Ciphertext classification; Ciphertexts; Convolutional neural network; Features extraction; Gated recurrent unit; Task analysis; Long short-term memory",,"Swapna, S., Dileep, A.D., Sekhar, C.C., Kant, S., Block cipher identi-cation using support vector classi-cation and regression (2010) J.

While research in the sexism detection domain is growing, most of this research focuses on English as the language and on Twitter as the platform. Our objective here is to broaden the scope of this research by considering the Chinese language on Sina Weibo. We propose the first Chinese sexism dataset – Sina Weibo Sexism Review (SWSR) dataset –, as well as a large Chinese lexicon SexHateLex made of abusive and gender-related terms. We introduce our data collection and annotation process, and provide an exploratory analysis of the dataset characteristics to validate its quality and to show how sexism is manifested in Chinese. The SWSR dataset provides labels at different levels of granularity including (i) sexism or non-sexism, (ii) sexism category and (iii) target type, which can be exploited, among others, for building computational methods to identify and investigate finer-grained gender-related abusive language. We conduct experiments for the three sexism classification tasks making use of state-of-the-art machine learning models. Our results show competitive performance, providing a benchmark for sexism detection in the Chinese language, as well as an error analysis highlighting open challenges needing more research in Chinese NLP. The SWSR dataset and SexHateLex lexicon are publicly available.1 © 2021","Abusive language detection; Chinese sexism dataset; Chinese sexist lexicon; Hate speech detection; Natural language processing; Sexism detection","Benchmarking; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Quality control; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Abusive language detection; Chinese language; Chinese sexism dataset; Chinese sexist lexicon; Hate speech detection; Language detection; Sexism detection; Sina-weibo; Social media platforms; Speech detection; Natural language processing systems","CSC","Fortuna, P., Soler-Company, J., Wanner, L., How well do hate speech, toxicity, abusive and offensive language classification models generalize across datasets?

Most automatic hate speech detection approaches cast the problem into a binary classification task without addressing either the topical focus or the target-oriented nature of hate speech. In this paper, we propose to tackle, for the first time, hate speech detection from a multi-target perspective. We leverage manually annotated datasets, to investigate the problem of transferring knowledge from different datasets with different topical focuses and targets. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we explore the ability of hate speech detection models to capture common properties from topic-generic datasets and transfer this knowledge to recognize specific manifestations of hate speech; (2) we experiment with the development of models to detect both topics (racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny) and hate speech targets, going beyond standard binary classification, to investigate how to detect hate speech at a finer level of granularity and how to transfer knowledge across different topics and targets; and (3) we study the impact of affective knowledge encoded in sentic computing resources (SenticNet, EmoSenticNet) and in semantically structured hate lexicons (HurtLex) in determining specific manifestations of hate speech. We experimented with different neural models including multitask approaches. Our study shows that: (1) training a model on a combination of several (training sets from several) topic-specific datasets is more effective than training a model on a topic-generic dataset; (2) the multi-task approach outperforms a single-task model when detecting both the hatefulness of a tweet and its topical focus in the context of a multi-label classification approach; and (3) the models incorporating EmoSenticNet emotions, the first level emotions of SenticNet, a blend of SenticNet and EmoSenticNet emotions or affective features based on Hurtlex, obtained the best results. Our results demonstrate that multi-target hate speech detection from existing datasets is feasible, which is a first step towards hate speech detection for a specific topic/target when dedicated annotated data are missing. Moreover, we prove that domain-independent affective knowledge, injected into our models, helps finer-grained hate speech detection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Affective resources; Hate speech detection; Hate speech targets; Multi-task learning; Social media","Classification (of information); Knowledge management; Speech; Speech communication; Annotated datasets; Binary classification; Domain independents; Multi label classification; On-line communication; Sexual orientations; Social media platforms; Vulnerable groups; Speech recognition","UNITO","Characterizing Linguistic Attributes for Automatic Classification of Intent Based Racist/Radicalized Posts on Tumblr Micro-Blogging Website (2017) Corr, Abs/1701, p. 04931. , http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04931; Akhtar, M.S., Ekbal, A., Cambria, E., How intense are you?

In this study, we focus on natural language processing (NLP) and, more concretely, the emerging field of affective computing to explore the automation of understanding human emotions from texts. This paper continues previous efforts to utilize and adapt affective techniques into different areas to gain new insights. This paper proposes two novel feature extraction methods that use the previous sentic computing resources AffectiveSpace and SenticNet. These methods are efficient approaches for extracting affect-aware representations from text. In addition, this paper presents a machine learning framework using an ensemble of different features to improve the overall classification performance. Following the description of this approach, we also study the effects of known feature extraction methods such as TF-IDF and SIMilarity-based sentiment projectiON (SIMON). We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed features across five different datasets that cover radicalization and hate speech detection tasks. To compare the different approaches fairly, we conducted a statistical test that ranks the studied methods. The obtained results indicate that combining affect-aware features with the studied textual representations effectively improves performance. We also propose a criterion considering both classification performance and computational complexity to select among the different methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Affective computing; Hate speech detection; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Radicalization detection; Sentic computing","Extraction; Natural language processing systems; Speech recognition; Turing machines; Affective Computing; Classification performance; Feature extraction methods; Myriad applications; NAtural language processing; Sentic Computing; Speech detection; Textual representation; Feature extraction","H2020; MICINN","Hendler, J., Shadbolt, N., Hall, W., Berners-Lee, T., Weitzner, D., Web science: an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the web (2008) Commun ACM, 51 (7), pp. 60-69; Cambria, E., White, B., Jumping NLP curves: A review of natural language processing research (2014) IEEE Comput Intell Mag, 9 (2), pp. 48-57; Dashtipour, K., Poria, S., Hussain, A., Cambria, E., Hawalah, A.Y., Gelbukh, A., Zhou, Q., Multilingual sentiment analysis: state of the art and independent comparison of techniques (2016) Cogn Comput, 8 (4), pp. 757-771; Tao, J., Tan, T., Affective computing: A review (2005) International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, pp. 981-995. , https://doi.org/10.1007/11573548\_125, Springer; Crowston, K., Allen, E.E., Heckman, R., Using natural language processing technology for qualitative data analysis (2012) Int J Soc Res Methodol, 15 (6), pp. 523-543; Cambria, E., Hussain, A., Sentic computing: A common-sense-based framework for concept-level sentiment analysis (2015) Cogn Comput, 7, pp. 183-185; Araque, O., Zhu, G., Iglesias, C.A., A semantic similarity-based perspective of affect lexicons for sentiment analysis (2019) Knowl-Based Syst, 165, pp. 346-359. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095070511930526X; Cambria, E., Fu, J., Bisio, F., Poria, S., AffectiveSpace 2: Enabling affective intuition for concept-level sentiment analysis (2015) Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 508-514. , AAAI Press; Cambria, E., Poria, S., Gelbukh, A., Thelwall, M., Sentiment analysis is a big suitcase (2017) IEEE Intell Syst, 32 (6), pp. 74-80; Cambria, E., Affective computing and sentiment analysis (2016) IEEE Intell Syst, 31 (2), pp. 102-107; Cambria, E., Li, Y., Xing, F.Z., Poria, S., Kwok, K., SenticNet 6: Ensemble application of symbolic and subsymbolic ai for sentiment analysis.

Millions of users engage themselves with the posts circulated on these platforms. Despite the social regulations and protocols imposed by these platforms, it is difficult to restrict some objectionable posts carrying hateful content. Automatic hate speech detection on social media platforms is an essential task that has not been solved efficiently despite multiple attempts by various researchers. It is a challenging task that involves identifying hateful content from social media posts. These posts may reveal hate outrageously, or they may be subjective to the user or a community. Relying on manual inspection delays the process, and the hateful content may remain available online for a long time. The current state-of-the-art methods for tackling hate speech perform well when tested on the same dataset but fail miserably on cross-datasets. Therefore, we propose an ensemble learning-based adaptive model for automatic hate speech detection, improving the cross-dataset generalization. The proposed expert model for hate speech detection works towards overcoming the strong user-bias present in the available annotated datasets. We conduct our experiments under various experimental setups and demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy on the latest issues such as COVID-19 and US presidential elections. In particular, the loss in performance observed under cross-dataset evaluation is the least among all the models. Also, while restricting the maximum number of tweets per user, we incur no drop in performance. © 2021","Ensemble learning; Hate speech detection; Social media","Learning systems; Speech; Speech recognition; Case-studies; Ensemble learning; Hate speech detection; Learning models; Performance; Social media; Social media platforms; Social protocols; Social regulations; Speech detection; Social networking (online)",,"Agarwal, S., Chowdary, C.R., A-stacking and a-bagging: Adaptive versions of ensemble learning algorithms for spoof fingerprint detection (2020) Expert Systems with Applications, 146. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419308784, URL; Agarwal, S., Rattani, A., Chowdary, C.R., A comparative study on handcrafted features v/s deep features for open-set fingerprint liveness detection (2021) Pattern Recognition Letters, 147, pp. 34-40. , https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865521001276, URL; Agrawal, S., Awekar, A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms (2018) Advances in information retrieval - 40th European conference on IR research, ECIR 2018, Grenoble, France, March 26-29, 2018, Proceedings, pp. 141-153. , Pasi G.

Given the increasing number of experiences of sexism shared online, categorizing these recollections automatically can support the battle against sexism, since it can promote successful evaluations by gender studies researchers and government representatives engaged in policy making. In this paper, we examine the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism. We devise self-training-based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. In addition to data augmentation methods, we develop a neural model which combines biLSTM and attention with a domain-adapted BERT model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Further, we formulate a multi-level training approach in which models are sequentially trained using categories of sexism of different levels of granularity. Moreover, we devise a loss function that exploits any label confidence scores associated with the data. Several proposed methods outperform various baselines on a recently released dataset for multi-label sexism categorization across several standard metrics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Fine-grained categorization; Multi-label classification; Multi-level; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification","Supervised learning; Fine grained; Fine-grained categorization; Gender studies; Multi-label classifications; Multi-labels; Multilevels; Policy making; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification; Classification (of information)",,"Abburi, H., Parikh, P., Chhaya, N., Varma, V., Semi-supervised multi-task learning for multi-label fine-grained sexism classification (2020) Proceedings of the 28Th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, International Committee on Computational Linguistics, pp. 5810-5820. , Barcelona, Spain (Online); Abney, S., (2007) Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics, , Chapman and Hall/CRC; Agrawal, S., Awekar, A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms (2018) European Conference on Information Retrieval, pp. 141-153. , Springer; Anzovino, M., Fersini, E., Rosso, P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter (2018) International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64. , Springer; Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760. , In:, International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, pp; Burnap, P., Williams, M.L., Us and them: identifying cyber hate on twitter across multiple protected characteristics (2016) EPJ Data Sci, 5 (1), p. 11; Cer, D., Yang, Y., Syhua, N., Limtiaco, N., John, R.S., Constant, N., Guajardo-Cespedes, M., Tar, C., (2018) Universal sentence encoder, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Chiril, P., Moriceau, V., Benamara, F., Mari, A., Origgi, G., Coulomb-Gully, M., An annotated corpus for sexism detection in french tweets (2020) Proceedings of the 12Th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 1397-1403; Chiril, P., Moriceau, V., Benamara, F., Mari, A., Origgi, G., Coulomb-Gully, M., He said “who’s gonna take care of your children when you are at acl?’: Reported sexist acts are not sexist (2020) Proceedings of the 58Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 4055-4066; Chowdhury, A.G., Sawhney, R., Shah, R., Mahata, D., # youtoo?

To better understand the online manifestations of this type of hate, and to propose methods that can automatically identify it, in this paper, we conduct a study on 4 cases of Black women in Tech reporting experiences of misogynoir on the Twitter platform. We follow the reactions to these cases (both supportive and non-supportive responses), and categorise them within a model of misogynoir that highlights experiences of Tone Policing, White Centring, Racial Gaslighting and Defensiveness. As an intersectional form of abusive or hateful speech, we investigate the possibilities and challenges to detect online instances of misogynoir in an automated way. We then conduct a closer qualitative analysis on messages of support and non-support to look at some of these categories in more detail. The purpose of this investigation is to understand responses to misogynoir online, including doubling down on misogynoir, engaging in performative allyship, and showing solidarity with Black women in tech. © 2021 ACM.","misogynoir; public response; social media","Doublings; Misogynoir; Public response; Qualitative analysis; Social media; Social networking (online)",,"Bailey, M., Trudy, On misogynoir: Citation, erasure, and plagiarism (2018) Feminist Media Studies, 18 (4), pp. 762-768; Trudy, Explanation of misogynoir (2014) Gradient Lair; Epstein, R., Blake, J., González, T., (2017) Girlhood Interrupted: The Erasure of Black Girls' Childhood, , SSRN 3000695; Tan, Y.C., Celis, L.E., Assessing social and intersectional biases in contextualized word representations (2019) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 13230-13241; Madden, S., Janoske, M., Winkler, R.B., Edgar, A.N., Mediated misogynoir: Intersecting race and gender in online harassment (2018) Mediating Misogyny.

The feeling of hatred, fear, or resentment is present before people from different communities from ours. With the rise of social networks like Twitter, hate speeches were swift because of the pseudo feeling of anonymity that these platforms provide. Sometimes this violent behavior on social networks that begins as threats or insults to third parties breaks the Internet barriers to become an act of real physical violence. Hence, this proposal aims to correctly classify xenophobic posts on social networks, specifically on Twitter. In addition, we collected a xenophobic tweets database from which we also extracted new features by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach. Then, we provide an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model, allowing us to understand better why a post is considered xenophobic. Consequently, we provide a set of contrast patterns describing xenophobic tweets, which could help decision-makers prevent acts of violence caused by xenophobic posts on Twitter. Finally, our interpretable results based on our new feature representation approach jointly with a contrast pattern-based classifier obtain similar classification results than other feature representations jointly with prominent machine learning classifiers, which are not easy to understand by an expert in the application area. © 2021 by the authors.

Such remarks are barriers to promoting diversity and inclusion in the software engineering (SE) domain. Aims: This study aims to develop a rubric to identify misogynistic remarks and sexist jokes specifically from software developer communications. Method: We have followed the systematic literature review protocol to identify 10 primary studies that have characterized misogynistic and sexist texts in various domains. Results: Based on our syntheses of the primary studies, we have developed a rubric to manually identity various categories of misogynistic or sexist remarks.We have also provided SE domain specific examples of those categories. Conclusions: Our annotation guideline will pave the path towards building automated misogynistic text classifier for the SE domain. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Most of current annotation procedures are aimed at achieving a high level of agreement in order to generate a high quality reference source. However, the annotation guidelines for subjective content may restrict the annotators’ freedom of decision making. Motivated by a moderate annotation agreement in offensive content datasets, we hypothesize that personalized approaches to offensive content identification should be in place. Thus, we propose two novel perspectives of perception: group-based and individual. Using demographics of annotators as well as embeddings of their previous decisions (annotated texts), we are able to train multimodal models (including transformer-based) adjusted to personal or community profiles. Based on the agreement of individuals and groups, we experimentally showed that annotator group agreeability strongly correlates with offensive content recognition quality. The proposed personalized approaches enabled us to create models adaptable to personal user beliefs rather than to agreed offensiveness understanding. Overall, our individualized approaches to offensive content classification outperform classic data-centric methods that generalize offensiveness perception and it refers to all six tested models. Additionally, we developed requirements for annotation procedures, personalization and content processing to make the solutions human-centered. © 2021 The Author(s)","Annotator agreement; Hate speech; Human-centered NLP; Multimodal deep learning; Offensive content; Personalization; Subjective content perception","Deep learning; Information retrieval; Quality control; 'current; Annotator agreement; Data centric; Hate speech; High quality; Human-centered NLP; Multimodal deep learning; Offensive content; Personalizations; Subjective content perception; Decision making","NCN; MNiSW; WUST; ERDF","Agarwal, A., Xie, B., Vovsha, I., Rambow, O., Passonneau, R., (2011), J.

Abusive comments on images can be humiliating and harmful to those who share photos. Developing a comment filter in languages other than English is difficult and time-consuming. This paper proposes a dataset called Abusive Turkish Comments (ATC) to detect abusive Instagram comments in Turkish. It is composed of a large number of Instagram comments posted to tabloid and sports accounts (i.e., 10,528 abusive and 19,826 not-abusive). It is the first public dataset dedicated to detecting abusive Turkish messages, as far as we know. The sentiment annotation has been done in sentence-level by assigning polarity to each comment. The performance of the abusive message detection models was evaluated using several performance metrics: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), five well-known classifiers (i.e., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression), and two reweighted classifiers (i.e., Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) were compared in terms of F1-score, precision, and recall. The results showed that the best performance (i.e., Micro-averaged F1-score: 0.974, Macro-averaged F1-score: 0.973, Kappa-value: 0.946) was yielded by the CNN model on the oversampled ATC dataset. The abusive message detection model proposed in this study can contribute to the development of Turkish comment filters on Instagram. Different model combinations are considered to select the best model that gives better recognition accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive comment; Classification; Dataset; Hate speech; Instagram; Social media","Adaptive boosting; Classifiers; Convolution; Decision trees; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Abusive comment; Convolutional neural network; Dataset; F1 scores; Hate speech; Instagram; Message detection; Performance; Social media; Turkishs; Classification (of information)",,"Abooraig, R., Al-Zu'bi, S., Kanan, T., Hawashin, B., Al Ayoub, M., Hmeidi, I., Automatic categorization of Arabic articles based on their political orientation (2018) Digital Investigation, 25, pp. 24-41; (2017), https://doi.org/10.1109/INTECH.2017.8102422, Abroyan, N.

Significant effort in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has been devoted to addressing this problem through abusive content detection and related sub-areas, such as the detection of hate speech, toxicity, cyberbullying, etc. Although current technologies achieve high classification performance in research studies, it has been observed that the real-life application of this technology can cause unintended harms, such as the silencing of under-represented groups. We review a large body of NLP research on automatic abuse detection with a new focus on ethical challenges, organized around eight established ethical principles: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. In many cases, these principles relate not only to situational ethical codes, which may be context-dependent, but are in fact connected to universal human rights, such as the right to privacy, freedom from discrimination, and freedom of expression. We highlight the need to examine the broad social impacts of this technology, and to bring ethical and human rights considerations to every stage of the application life-cycle, from task formulation and dataset design, to model training and evaluation, to application deployment. Guided by these principles, we identify several opportunities for rights-respecting, socio-technical solutions to detect and confront online abuse, including 'nudging', 'quarantining', value sensitive design, counter-narratives, style transfer, and AI-driven public education applications. © 2021 AI Access Foundation.

In the wake of growing documentation of experiences of sexism on the web, the automatic categorization of accounts of sexism has the potential to assist social scientists and policymakers in studying and thereby countering sexism. The existing work on sexism classification has certain limitations in terms of the categories of sexism used and/or whether they can co-occur. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the multi-label classification of sexism of any kind(s).1 We also consider the related task of misogyny classification. While sexism classification is performed on textual accounts describing sexism suffered or observed, misogyny classification is carried out on tweets perpetrating misogyny. We devise a novel neural framework for classifying sexism and misogyny that can combine text representations obtained using models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with distributional and linguistic word embeddings using a flexible architecture involving recurrent components and optional convolutional ones. Further, we leverage unlabeled accounts of sexism to infuse domain-specific elements into our framework. To evaluate the versatility of our neural approach for tasks pertaining to sexism and misogyny, we experiment with adapting it for misogyny identification. For categorizing sexism, we investigate multiple loss functions and problem transformation techniques to address the multi-label problem formulation. We develop an ensemble approach using a proposed multi-label classification model with potentially overlapping subsets of the category set. Proposed methods outperform several deep-learning as well as traditional machine learning baselines for all three tasks. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","machine learning; misogyny classification; misogyny detection; multi-label classification; neural networks; Sexism classification; text classification","Recurrent neural networks; Automatic categorization; Ensemble approaches; Flexible architectures; Multi label classification; Multi-label problems; Problem transformations; Recurrent components; Text representation; Classification (of information)",,"Agrawal, S., Awekar, A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms (2018) Proceedings of the European Conference on Information Retrieval.

However, it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study. © 2021 ACM.","antisemitism; deep learning; hate speech; multimodal classification","E-learning; Learning systems; Signal processing; Social networking (online); Turing machines; Critical tasks; Multi-modal; Multimodal detection; Multiple modalities; Online social medias; Qualitative analysis; Social media; Deep learning",,"Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets (2017) WWW, pp. 759-760; Brustein, W.I., (2003) Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust, , https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511499425, Cambridge University Press; Chandra, M., Pathak, A., Dutta, E., Jain, P., Gupta, M., Shrivastava, M., Kumaraguru, P., AbuseAnalyzer: Abuse detection, severity and target prediction for gab posts (2020) COLING, pp. 6277-6283; Chatzakou, D., Kourtellis, N., Blackburn, J., De Cristofaro, E., Stringhini, G., Vakali, A., Mean birds: Detecting aggression and bullying on twitter (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference, pp. 13-22; Davidson, T., Warmsley, D., Macy, M., Weber, I., (2017) Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language, , 2017; Devlin, J., Chang, M., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, , 2018; Fleiss, J.L., Measuring nominal scale agreement among many raters (1971) Psychological Bulletin, 76 (5), pp. 378-382. , 1971; Founta, A., Chatzakou, D., Kourtellis, N., Blackburn, J., Vakali, A., Leontiadis, I., A unified deep learning architecture for abuse detection (2019) WebSci, pp. 105-114; Fukui, A., Huk Park, D., Yang, D., Rohrbach, A., Darrell, T., Rohrbach, M., (2016) Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for Visual Question Answering and Visual Grounding, , 2016; Gambäck, B., Kumar Sikdar, U., Using convolutional neural networks to classify hate-speech (2017) Proceedings of the FirstWorkshop on Abusive Language Online, pp. 85-90. , https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/W17-3013, Association for Computational Linguistics, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Gomez, R., Gibert, J., Gomez, L., Karatzas, D., Exploring hate speech detection in multimodal publications (2020) The IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV); He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 770-778; Huang, G., Liu, Z., Van Der Maaten, L., Weinberger, K.Q., Densely connected convolutional networks (2017) 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), , https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr.2017.243, Jul 2017; Jikeli, G., Cavar, D., Miehling, D., Annotating antisemitic online content (2019) Towards An Applicable Definition of Antisemitism., , 2019; Joulin, A., Grave, E., Bojanowski, P., Douze, M., Jégou, H., Mikolov, T., Fasttext (2016) Zip: Compressing Text Classification Models., , 2016; Khattar, D., Singh Goud, J., Gupta, M., Varma, V., MVAE: Multimodal variational autoencoder for fake news detection (2019) The World Wide Web Conference, pp. 2915-2921. , Association for Computing Machinery; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014) Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, , [cs.

However, cross-dataset model generalization remains a challenge. In this context, we address two still open central questions: (i) to what extent does the generalization depend on the model and the composition and annotation of the training data in terms of different categories?, and (ii) do specific features of the datasets or models influence the generalization potential? To answer (i), we experiment with BERT, ALBERT, fastText, and SVM models trained on nine common public English datasets, whose class (or category) labels are standardized (and thus made comparable), in intra- and cross-dataset setups. The experiments show that indeed the generalization varies from model to model and that some of the categories (e.g., ‘toxic’, ‘abusive’, or ‘offensive’) serve better as cross-dataset training categories than others (e.g., ‘hate speech’). To answer (ii), we use a Random Forest model for assessing the relevance of different model and dataset features during the prediction of the performance of 450 BERT, 450 ALBERT, 450 fastText, and 348 SVM binary abusive language classifiers (1698 in total). We find that in order to generalize well, a model already needs to perform well in an intra-dataset scenario. Furthermore, we find that some other parameters are equally decisive for the success of the generalization, including, e.g., the training and target categories and the percentage of the out-of-domain vocabulary. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Generalization; Hate speech; Offensive language","Automation; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Classification models; Model generalization; Offensive languages; Random forest modeling; SVM model; Training data; Classification (of information)","EC; FCT; ESF; MCTES; FCT","Almerekhi, H., Kwak, H., Jansen, B.J., Salminen, J., Detecting toxicity triggers in online discussions (2019) Proceedings of the 30th ACM conference on hypertext and social media, HT ’19, pp. 291-292. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Arango, A., Pérez, J., Poblete, B., Hate speech detection is not as easy as you may think: A closer look at model validation (2019) Proceedings of the 42nd international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, SIGIR'19, pp. 45-54. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Arango, A., Pérez, J., Poblete, B., Hate speech detection is not as easy as you may think: a closer look at model validation (extended version) (2020) Information Systems; Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web companion, pp. 759-760. , International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee; Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Patti, V., Rangel Pardo, F.M., SemEval-2019 task 5: multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter (2019) Proceedings of the 13th international workshop on semantic evaluation, pp. 54-63. , Association for Computational Linguistics Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., Enriching word vectors with subword information (2017) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146; Chandrasekharan, E., Samory, M., Srinivasan, A., Gilbert, E., The bag of communities: Identifying abusive behavior online with preexisting internet data (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 CHI conference on human factors in computing systems, CHI ’17, pp. 3175-3187. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Davidson, T., Warmsley, D., Macy, M.W., Weber, I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language (2017) Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on web and social media, ICWSM 2017, MontréAl, QuéBec, Canada, May 15-18, 2017, pp. 512-515. , AAAI Press; de Gibert, O., Perez, N., García-Pablos, A., Cuadros, M., Hate speech dataset from a white supremacy forum (2018) Proceedings of the 2nd workshop on abusive language online (ALW2), pp. 11-20. , Association for Computational Linguistics Brussels, Belgium; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 conference of the North American chapter of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies, volume 1 (long and short papers), pp. 4171-4186. , Association for Computational Linguistics Minneapolis, Minnesota; d'Sa, A.G., Illina, I., Fohr, D., BERT and fasttext embeddings for automatic detection of toxic speech (2020) SIIE 2020-information systems and economic intelligence; Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Rosso, P., Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (AMI) (2018) Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for Italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (CLiC-It 2018), Turin, Italy, December 12-13, 2018, CEUR workshop proceedings, 2263. , Caselli T.

Timely detection of the objectionable content is very important for its prevention and reduction. This article explores and spotlights diversity of definitions of cyber-Aggression, cyberbulling, and cyber-grooming; analyzes current categorization systems and taxonomies; identifies the targets, target categories, and subcategories of the subjects of the objectionable content research; analyzes the ambiguity of the linguistic terms in the domain; reviews present databases gathered for researching the field; explores types of features used for modeling systems for automatic detection; and examines methods for automatic detection and/or prediction of the objectionable content. The results point to directions of system development for tracing transformations of objectionable content over time on different online social platforms. © 2021 ACM.","automatic hate speech detection; Cyber-Aggression; cyber-grooming; cyber-predators; cyberbulluing","Computer crime; Linguistics; Social networking (online); Automatic Detection; Categorization systems; Cyber bullying; Linguistic terms; Model system; Online social medias; System development; Automatic hate speech detection; Cybe-aggression; Cybe-grooming; Cybe-predator; Cyberbulluing; Research challenges; Speech detection; Social networking (online); Linguistics",,"Aggrawal, N., 2018.

Social media, blogs and community forums are examples where people are freely allowed to communicate. However, freedom of expression is not always respectful since offensive or insulting language is sometimes used. Social media companies often rely on users and content moderators to report on this type of content. Nevertheless, due to the large amount of content generated every day on the Web, automatic systems based on Natural Language Processing techniques are required for identifying abusive language online. To date, most of the systems developed to combat this problem are mainly focused on English content, but this issue is a worldwide concern and therefore other languages such as Spanish are involved. In this paper, we address the task of Spanish hate speech identification on social media and provide a deeper understanding of the capabilities of new techniques based on machine learning. In particular, we compare the performance of Deep Learning methods with recently pre-trained language models based on Transfer Learning as well as with traditional machine learning models. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in Spanish by applying multilingual and monolingual pre-trained language models such as BERT, XLM and BETO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BERT; BETO; Hate speech; Natural language processing; Text classification; Transfer learning","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Transfer learning; Automatic systems; Language model; Large amounts; Learning methods; Machine learning models; NAtural language processing; Speech detection; Speech identification; Learning systems","MCIU; FEDER","Aragón, M.E., Álvarez-Carmona, M., (2019), Á., Montes-y Gómez, M., Escalante, H.

The evaluation campaigns of EVALITA and IberEval in 2018 proposed a shared task of Automatic Misogyny Identification (AMI) based on Italian, English and Spanish tweets. Since the participating teams’ results were pretty low in the misogynistic behaviour categorization, the aim of this study is to investigate the possible causes. We measured the overlap and the homogeneity of the clusters by varying the number of categories. This experiment showed that the clusters overlap.

Moreover, it is even more complex in the social media context due to language and media specificities. Despite these challenges, advances in this task may help improving collective well-being on social media. In this context, the biCourage team participated in the English version of Task 1 of HASOC 2021, a shared task for “Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in English and Indo-Aryan Languages”. Our participation in this campaign aimed to examine the suitability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN), due to their capability to integrate flexible contextual priors, as a computationally effective solution compared to more computationally expensive and relatively data-hungry methods, such as fine-tuning. Specifically, we explored and combined two text-to-graph strategies based on different language modelling objectives, comparing them with fine-tuned Bert. We submitted the results of several deep learning architectures, comprised of different arrangements of GCNs and transformer architectures. Our team achieved the best results in both subtasks using the GCNs based architectures combining two text-to-graph strategies ranked in 21st and 20th positions in Subtasks 1A and 1B. Assessing the models’ prediction, we identify complementary capabilities in the text-to-graph strategies that further research on their combination can explore. Moreover, the proposed GCN model is 3.85 times faster than fine-tuned Bert in training speed and still outperforms it by 2.3% and 5.41% on the F1 score of Subtasks 1A and 1B, respectively. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Bert fine-tuning; biCourage; graph convolutional network; hate speech; text-to-graph","Computational linguistics; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Graph neural networks; Modeling languages; Network architecture; Neural network models; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Bert fine-tuning; Bicourage; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Fine tuning; Graph convolutional network; Hate speech; Social media; Subtask; Text-to-graph; Deep learning","","Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (2010) Modern Information Retrieval, , (Eds), 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley; Ognibene, D., Taibi, D., Kruschwitz, U., Wilkens, R.

This phenomenon becomes particularly im-pactful in the sensitive real-world context of abusive language detection systems, where non-discrimination is difficult to assess. In addition, given the opaqueness of their internal behavior, the dynamics leading a model to a certain decision are often not clear nor accountable, and significant problems of trust could emerge. A robust value-oriented evaluation of models' fairness is therefore necessary. In this paper, we present FairShades, a model-agnostic approach for auditing the outcomes of abusive language detection systems. Combining explainability and fairness evaluation, Fair-Shades can identify unintended biases and sensitive categories towards which models are most discriminative. This objective is pursued through the auditing of meaningful counterfactuals generated within CheckList framework. We conduct several ex-periments on BERT-based models to demonstrate our proposal's novelty and effectiveness for unmasking biases. © 2021 IEEE.","Abusive Language Detection; Algorithmic Bias; Explainability; Fairness in ML","Abusive language detection; Algorithmic bias; Algorithmics; Detection system; Explainability; Fairness evaluation; Fairness in ML; Language detection; Marginalization; Real-world; Algorithmic languages","H2020; EC","Suresh, H., Guttag, J.V., A framework for understanding unintended consequences of machine learning (2019) CoRR, , vol. abs/1901.10002; Mehrabi, N., Morstatter, F., Saxena, N., A survey on bias and fairness in machine learning (2021) ACM Comput.

For example, the sentiments expressed in a text concerning a topic in the discussion tend to influence a community when a Twitter user retweets the original text, causing a chain of reactions within a network. This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo. Specifically, we collect the tweets mentioned above and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral. In this context, we address the problem as a multiclass classification problem by using the pre-trained language models ULMFiT and AWD-LSTM, which achieved a Fmicro of 0.85. Finally, we use the classified dataset to conduct a case study in which we capture the sentiment orientation during the network evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; NLP; Online Social Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; ULMFiT","E-learning; Long short-term memory; Polarization; Sentiment analysis; Case-studies; Classifieds; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Hashtags; Hate speech; Language model; Multiclass classification problems; Sentiment analysis; ULMFiT; Social networking (online)",,"Bollen, J., Pepe, A., Mao, H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena (2009) CORR; Belkin, L., Kurtzberg, T., Naquin, C., Emotional contagion in the online environment: Investigating the dynamics and implications of emotional encounters in mixed-motive situations in the electronic context (2006) SSRN Electronic Journal, , 07; Hillmann, R., Trier, M., Sentiment polarization and balance among users in online social networks (2012) AMCIS, 24; Seo, K., Pan, R., Panasyuk, A., Detecting communities by sentiment analysis of controversial topics (2016) SBP-BRiMS, 9708, pp. 206-215. , Germany; Collobert, R., Weston, J., Bottou, L., Karlen, M., Kavukcuoglu, K., Kuksa, P., (2011) Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch; Frenda, S., Ghanem, B., Montes, M., Rosso, P., Online hate speech against women: Automatic identification of misogyny and sexism on twitter (2019) Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 36, pp. 4743-4752; Sharma, S., Agrawal, S., Shrivastava, M., Degree based classification of harmful speech using twitter data (2018) TRAC, pp. 106-112. , Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA; Mathew, B., Dutt, R., Goyal, P., Mukherjee, A., (2018) Spread of Hate Speech in Online Social Media; Wulczyn, E., Thain, N., Dixon, L., (2016) Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale; Tsantarliotis, P., Pitoura, E., Tsaparas, P., Troll vulnerability in online social networks (2016) ASONAM, pp. 1394-1396; Fornacciari, P., Mordonini, M., Tomaiuolo, M., (2015) Social Network and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: Towards A Combined Approach, pp. 53-64. , 01; Xu, Z., Yang, Q., Analyzing user retweet behavior on twitter (2012) ASONAM, pp. 46-50. , 08; Jiang, L., Yu, M., Zhou, M., Liu, X., Zhao, T., (2011) Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification, pp. 151-160. , 01; Speriosu, M., Sudan, N., Upadhyay, S., Baldridge, J., (2011) Twitter Polarity Classification with Label Propagation over Lexical Links and the Follower Graph, pp. 53-63. , 07; Founta, A.M., Chatzakou, D., Kourtellis, N., Blackburn, J., Vakali, A., Leontiadis, I., A unified deep learning architecture for abuse detection (2019) WebSci, pp. 105-114. , New York, NY, USA; Cao, R., Lee, R.K.-W., Hoang, T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations (2020) 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, Ser.

However, the existing theoretical definitions of hate speech are not sufficiently fleshed out or easily operable. To overcome this inadequacy, and with the help of interdisciplinary experts, we propose an empirical definition of hate speech by providing a list of 10 hate speech indicators and the rationale behind them (the indicators refer to specific, observable, and measurable characteristics that offer a practical definition of hate speech). A preliminary exploratory examination of the structure of hate speech, with the focus on comments related to migrants (one of the most reported grounds of hate speech), revealed that two indicators in particular, denial of human rights and promoting violent behavior, occupy a central role in the network of indicators. Furthermore, we discuss the practical implications of the proposed hate speech indicators—especially (semi-)automatic detection using the latest natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods. Having a set of quantifiable indicators could benefit researchers, human right activists, educators, analysts, and regulators by providing them with a pragmatic approach to hate speech assessment and detection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Comments; Hate speech; Hate speech indicators; Hate speech structure; Migrants",,"SAS; APVV; VEGA; ","(2016) Eurobarometer, S. 452, media pluralism and democracy, , https://ec.europa.eu, Retrieved from; (2020) Being Young in Europe today—digital World, , https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat, Retrieved from; (2013) No Hate Speech Movement, , https://www.coe.int/en/web/no-hate-campaign, Retrieved from; (2016) General Policy Recommendation No. 15 on Combating Hate Speech, , https://coe.int, Retrieved from; Mathew, B., Saha, P., Tharad, H., Rajgaria, S., Singhania, P., Maity, S.K., Mukherjee, A., Thou shalt not hate: Countering online hate speech (2019) Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 13, pp. 369-380; Salminen, J., Hopf, M., Chowdhury, S.A., Developing an online hate classifier for multiple social media platforms (2020) Hum Cent Comput Inf Sci, 10, p. 1; Sambaraju, R., McVittie, C., Examining abuse in online media (2020) Soc Pers Psychol Compass, 14 (3); MacAvaney, S., Yao, H.R., Yang, E., Russell, K., Goharian, N., Frieder, O., Hate speech detection: challenges and solutions (2019) PLoS ONE, 14 (8); Brown, A., What is hate speech?

Often used to convey humor through sarcasm or to emphasize a point, offensive speech may also be employed to insult, deride and mock alternate points of view. In turbulent and chaotic circumstances, insults and mockery can lead to violence and unrest, and hence, such speech must be identified and tagged to limit its damage. This paper presents an application of machine learning to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds shared after the protests by Proud Boys, an extremist, ideological and violent hate group. A comprehensive coding guide, consolidating definitions of what constitutes offensive content based on the potential to trigger and incite people is developed and used to label the tweets. Linguistic, auxiliary and social features extracted from these labeled tweets were used to train machine learning classifiers, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of about 92%. An analysis of the importance scores reveals that offensiveness is pre-dominantly a function of words and their combinations, rather than meta features such as punctuations and quotes. This observation can form the foundation of pre-trained classifiers that can be deployed to automatically detect offensive speech in new and unforeseen circumstances. © 2021 IEEE.","Classification; Machine Learning; Offensive Speech; Proud Boys; Social Media","Classification (of information); Machine learning; Speech; Chaotics; Content-based; Machine-learning; Metafeature; Offensive speech; Online social medias; Proud boy; Social media; Social media platforms; Social networking (online)",,"(2019) The EU Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech Online, , https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-andfundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/, June; Abderroauf, C., Oussalah, M., On Online Hate Speech Detection: Effects of Negated Data Construction (2019) Proc. of Intl.

We hope that those models will provide unbiased and ethical decisions that will benefit everyone. However, this is not always the case; issues arise during the data preparation process throughout the steps leading to the models' deployment. The continued use of biased datasets and biased processes will adversely damage communities and increase the cost to fix the problem later. In this work, we walk through the decision making process that a researcher should consider before, during, and after a system deployment to understand the broader impacts of their research in the community. Throughout this paper, we discuss fairness, privacy, and ownership issues in the machine learning pipeline, assert the need for a responsible human-over-the-loop methodology to bring accountability into machine learning pipeline, and finally, reflect on the need to explore research agendas that have harmful societal impacts. We examine visual privacy research and draw lessons that can apply broadly to artificial intelligence. Our goal is to provide a systematic analysis of the machine learning pipeline for visual privacy and bias issues. With this pipeline, we hope to raise stakeholder (e.g., researchers, modelers, corporations) awareness as these issues propagate in the various machine learning phases. © 2021 IEEE.","fairness; human-over-the-loop; visual privacy","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Machine learning; Continued use; Data preparation; Decision-making process; Fairness; Human-over-the-loop; Ideal worlds; Machine learning models; Preparation process; System deployment; Visual privacy; Pipelines","NSF","Krishnamurthy, B., Wills, C.E., Characterizing privacy in online social networks (2008) Proceedings of the First Workshop on Online Social Networks.

Today, machine learning techniques play an important role in detecting inappropriate content and help moderate online interaction. Text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods has been extensively studied using deep learning models and transformers which have shown impressive results. Despite this, specific classification tasks on limited datasets still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose an approach based on an Attention-Based Bidirectional LSTM model and a combination of custom features to enhance automatic misogyny identification (AMI) on social media. We present a multi-lingual study of the phenomena by carrying out different classification experiments. Our study focuses on selecting most important features to improve the model for misogyny detection.

One way of improving model robustness is to generate counterfactually augmented data (CAD) for training models that can better learn to distinguish between core features and data artifacts. While models trained on this type of data have shown promising out-of-domain generalizability, it is still unclear what the sources of such improvements are. We investigate the benefits of CAD for social NLP models by focusing on three social computing constructs - sentiment, sexism, and hate speech. Assessing the performance of models trained with and without CAD across different types of datasets, we find that while models trained on CAD show lower in-domain performance, they generalize better out-of-domain. We unpack this apparent discrepancy using machine explanations and find that CAD reduces model reliance on spurious features. Leveraging a novel typology of CAD to analyze their relationship with model performance, we find that CAD which acts on the construct directly or a diverse set of CAD leads to higher performance. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided design; Content detection; Core datum; Core features; Data artifacts; Learn+; Model robustness; Performance; Social computing; Spurious features; Training model; Natural language processing systems","DFF","Atanasova, Pepa, Simonsen, Jakob Grue, Lioma, Christina, Augenstein, Isabelle, A Diagnostic Study of Explainability Techniques for Text Classification (2020) Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 3256-3274. , Online.

To account for the complexity of the task, we take a more 'nuanced' approach where our ConvAI dataset reflects fine-grained notions of abuse, as well as views from multiple expert annotators. We find that the distribution of abuse is vastly different compared to other commonly used datasets, with more sexually tinted aggression towards the virtual persona of these systems. Finally, we report results from bench-marking existing models against this data.

These subtasks were organised by IberLEF and IberEval 2021 workshops. During the participation on these subtasks, the linguistic features were evaluated separately and combined with state-of-the-art transformers by means of ensembles and knowledge integration strategies, with the objective of achieve competitive results in all tasks. At the same time, we seek to improve our methods to obtain some interpretability of the results. In summary, our results suggest than the combination of different feature sets improves text classification tasks, especially when they are input in the same neural network. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Every big news before telecasting on television comes to these forums, therefore raises many dilemmas due to misinterpretation regarding the freedom of speaking. One of this trouble is social intimidation that is very disturbing misbehavior that can cause troubling consequences for the victim. Existing works of social intimidation focuses on only one or two topics of harassment. The main aim of this study is to analyze the hub of social intimidation i.e. twitter, consisting of 25,000 tweets covering five topics of harassment i.e. sexism, racism, appearance related, political and intellectual. Moreover, five machine learning and four deep learning techniques were used namely sequential minimal optimization (SMO), random forest, multinomial naïve bayes, logistic regression (LR), decision tree J48, CNN-CB, CNN-GRU, CNN-LRCN and CNN-Bi-LSTM. Each of the classifiers are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure as a performance metric on the dataset. Results indicate the dominance of CNN-Bi-LSTM and logistic regression among all classifiers used. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CNN-Bi-LSTM; CNN-CB; CNN-GRU; CNN-LRCN; J48; Logistic regression; Multinomial NB; SMO; Social intimidation","Classification (of information); Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Optimization; Random forests; CNN-bi-LSTM; CNN-CB; CNN-GRU; CNN-LRCN; J48; Logistics regressions; Multinomial NB; Multinomials; Sequential minimal optimization; Social intimidation; Decision trees",,"Patchin, J.W., Hinduja, S., It is time to teach safe sexting (2020) J.

We propose a method based on logistic regression classifiers to probe English, French, and Arabic PTLMs and quantify the potentially harmful content that they convey with respect to a set of templates. The templates are prompted by a name of a social group followed by a cause-effect relation. We use PTLMs to predict masked tokens at the end of a sentence in order to examine how likely they enable toxicity towards specific communities. We shed the light on how such negative content can be triggered within unrelated and benign contexts based on evidence from a large-scale study, then we explain how to take advantage of our methodology to assess and mitigate the toxicity transmitted by PTLMs. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Cell proliferation; Computational linguistics; Cause-effect; Context-based; Language model; Large-scale studies; Logistic regression classifier; NLP systems; Social groups; Toxicity","NSFC; 研究資助局; ","Albadi, Nuha, Kurdi, Maram, Mishra, Shivakant, Are they our brothers? analysis and detection of religious hate speech in the arabic twitter-sphere (2018) Proceedings of ASONAM, pp. 69-76. , IEEE Computer Society; Aluru, Sai Saketh, Mathew, Binny, Saha, Punyajoy, Mukherjee, Animesh, Deep learning models for multilingual hate speech detection (2020) Proceedings of ECML/PKDD; Antoun, Wissam, Baly, Fady, Hajj, Hazem, Arabert: Transformer-based model for arabic language understanding (2020) LREC 2020 Workshop Language Resources and Evaluation Conference; Bender, Emily, Gebru, Timnit, Macmillan-Major, Angelina, Shmitchell, Shmargaret, On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?

In the digital era, misogynists have found in social networks a place in which they can spread their oppressive discourse towards women. Although this particular form of oppressive speech is banned and punished on most social networks, its identification is quite challenging due to the large number of messages posted everyday. Moreover, sexist comments can be unnoticed as condescends or friendly statements which hinders its identification even for humans. With the aim of improving automatic sexist identifi- cation on social networks, we participate in EXIST-2021. This shared task involves the identification and categorisation of sexism language on Spanish and English documents compiled from micro-blogging platforms. Specifically, two tasks were proposed, one concerning a binary classification of sexism utterances and another regarding multi-class identification of sexist traits. Our proposal for solving both tasks is grounded on the combination of linguistic features and state-of-the-art transformers by means of ensembles and multi-input neural networks. To address the multi-language problem, we tackle the problem independently by language to put the results together at the end. Our best result was achieved in task 1 with an accuracy of 75.14% and 61.70% for task 2. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

As sexist content towards women is increasingly spread on social networks, the automatic detection and categorization of these tweets/posts can help social scientists and policymakers in research, thereby combating sexism. In this paper, we explore the problem of detecting whether a Twitter/Gab post is sexist or not.We further discriminate the detected sexist post into one of the fine-grained sexism categories. We propose a neural model for this sexism detection and classification that can combine representations obtained using RoBERTa model and linguistic features such as Empath, Hurtlex, and Perspective API by involving recurrent components.We also leverage the unlabeled sexism data to infuse the domain-specific transformer model into our framework. Our proposed framework also features a knowledge module comprised of emoticon and hashtag representations to infuse the external knowledge-specific features into the learning process. Several proposed methods outperform various baselines across several standard metrics. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

We submitted three runs for each task, two of them based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) exploring different edge creation strategies and one combining graph embeddings from different GCN through ensemble methods. In addition, we explored different GCN models and text-to- graph strategies. We identified that in Task 2 the models take advantage of the syntactic relationship between words encoded in the graph, while it did not strongly impact Task 1. Moreover, the models generalized the task while maintaining similar (in some cases better) results in the social network that was not used in training. On average, our best models performed similarly across languages and social media, ranking 37th (out of 72 runs) for Task 1 and 40th (out of 63) for Task 2. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

The EXIST shared task proposes the first task on sEXism Identifica- tion in Social neTworks (EXIST) at IberLEF 2021 [30]. It provides a benchmark sexism dataset with Twitter and Gab posts in both English and Spanish, along with a task articulated in two subtasks consisting in sexism detection at different levels of granularity: Subtask 1 Sexism Iden- tification is a classical binary classification task to determine whether a given text is sexist or not, while Subtask 2 Sexism Categorisation is a finer-grained classification task focused on distinguishing different types of sexism. In this paper, we describe the participation of the QMUL-SDS team in EXIST. We propose an architecture made of the last 4 hidden states of XLM-RoBERTa and a TextCNN with 3 kernels. Our model also exploits lexical features relying on the use of new and existing lexicons of abusive words, with a special focus on sexist slurs and abusive words targeting women. Our team ranked 11th in Subtask 1 and 4th in Sub- task 2 among all the teams on the leaderboard, clearly outperforming the baselines offered by EXIST. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

In addition, hate-speech systems that understand humor are more reliable, as humor can be used as a Troy Horse to introduce oppressive-speech passing them off as harmless jokes. Understanding humor, however, is challenging because it is subjective as well as cultural and background dependant. Sharpen forms of humor, moreover, rely on figurative lan- guage, in which words loss their literally meaning. Therefore, humor de- tection has been proposed as shared-task in workshops in the last years. In this paper we describe our participation in the HAHA'2021 shared task, regarding fine-grain humor identification in Spanish. Our propos- als to solve these subtasks are grounded on the combination of linguistic features and transformers. We achieved the 1st position for humor rating Funniness Score Prediction with a RMSE of 0.6226, the 8th position for humor classification subtask with an 85.44 F1-score of humours category, and the 7th and the 3rd position for the subtasks of humor mechanism and target classification with an macro averaged F1-score of 20.31 and 32.25 respectively. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

The freedom of speech and ease of anonymity granted by social media has also resulted in incitement to hatred. This presents the need for automatic detection of sexist posts or tweets on social media. In this paper, we present the machine learning models that can detect sexism. Specifically, we describe the model submitted for the shared task on sEXism Identification in Social network at IberLeF 2021. The problem concentrates on sexism detection in two languages: English and Spanish. The challenge is divided into two tasks of different granularity: (1) a binary classification problem to discover the instances of sexism in the post and (2) to predict one the five types of sexism present. Overall, our performance is good but it needs some improvement, our scores are encouraging enough to work for better results in future. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Sexism permeates many layers of our society such as media, education or the work environment, and involves many aspects of our society such as gender equality, social respect, gender discrimantion, human rights, etc. In order to fight against this phenomenon, the first step is detecting it properly and in all its varieties. For that purpose, we present our candidate systems for participation in the EXIST challenge (task 1) at IberLEF 2021 for sexism identification. We explore an approach based on the use of pre-trained transformers, such as BERT and roBERTa, in similar tasks and compare them to traditional Machine Learning approaches, such as SVM, Logistic Regression, SGD-based classifier and XGBoost. We achieve our best results of F1=72.4% for the multi-language binary classification task for our system combining transformer-based and traditional models with a majority vote mechanism, positioned #32 in the challenge's ranking, with a F1 difference of 6% against the best result. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

The identification and classification of sexism in social media are very relevant tasks, as they would allow building a healthier social environment. Nevertheless, these tasks are considerably challenging. This work proposes a system to use multilingual and monolingual BERT and data points translation and ensemble strategies for sexism identification and classification in English and Spanish. It was conducted in the context of the sEXism Identification in Social neTworks shared 2021 (EXIST 2021) task, proposed by the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF). The proposed system and its main components are described, and an in-depth hyperparameters analysis is conducted. The main results observed were: (i) the system obtained better results than the baseline model (multilingual BERT); (ii) ensemble models obtained better results than monolingual models; and (iii) an ensemble model considering all individual models and the best standardized values obtained the best accuracies and F1-scores for both tasks. This work obtained first place in both tasks at EXIST, with the highest accuracies (0.780 for task 1 and 0.658 for task 2) and F1-scores (F1-binary of 0.780 for task 1 and F1-macro of 0.579 for task 2). © 2021 CEUR-WS.

As, Tandil, Argentina","Although hate speech detection has been extensively tackled in the literature as a classification task, recent works have raised concerns about the robustness of such systems. Understanding hate speech remains a significant challenge for creating reliable datasets and automatizing its detection. An essential goal for detection techniques is to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of offense. For example, ensuring that models are not reproducing common biases in society associating certain terms with hateful content. This situation is known as unintended bias, in which models learn usual associations between words (commonly called identity terms) which causes them to classify content as hateful just because it contains one identity word. In this work, we tackle the issue of measuring and explaining the sensitivity of models to the presence of identity terms during model training. To this end, focusing on a misogyny detection task, we study how models behave in the presence of the identified terms, and whether they contribute to biasing the performance of trained models. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

It is estimated that one in every three women worldwide has experienced physical, emotional, or sexual violence. Similarly, each year one out of two children are victims of some form of violence including domestic aggression and bullying. Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media, women and children are now vulnerable to other types of violence such as cyber-bullying and online sexual or emotional harassment. To help alleviate this social problem, the use of computer science and related technologies has been leveraged in recent years. The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and mobile computing, pattern recognition, cloud computing and similar technologies, have been used to formulate solutions to detect and prevent violent acts against women and children. In this paper, a systematic review of some of the efforts that can help address the problem of violence against women and children is presented. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of these contributions and identifies trends, architectures, technologies, and current open challenges. The survey was developed using a literature review of academic documents published from 2010 to 2020. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: online detection, offline detection, safety, and education. These contributions were further categorized based on the computer science approaches and technologies used: artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and digital serious games. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Internet of Things; machine learning; ubiquitous computing","Internet of things; Pattern recognition; Serious games; Ubiquitous computing; Cyber bullying; Literature reviews; On-line detection; Public health issues; Social media; Social problems; State of the art; Systematic Review; Artificial intelligence","TNM; CONACYT","Alliance, V.P., (2021) Definition and Typology of Violence, , https://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/definition/en/, [Online]; (2020) Global Status Report on Preventing Violence against Children, , https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-ofhealth/violence-prevention/global-status-report-on-violence-againstchildren-2020, Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization.

Detecting such content is crucial to filtering or blocking inappropriate content on the Web. However, due to the huge amount of data posted every day, automatic methods are essential for identifying this type of content. Seeking to address this issue, the Natural Language Processing community is increasingly involved in testing a wide range of techniques for hate speech detection. While achieving promising results, these techniques consider hate speech detection as the sole optimization objective, without involving other related tasks such as polarity and emotion classification that are strongly linked to offensive behavior. In this paper, we propose the first Multi-task approach that leverages the shared affective knowledge to detect hate speech in Spanish tweets, using a well-known Transformer-based model. Our results show that the combination of both polarity and emotional knowledge helps to detect hate speech more accurately across datasets. © 2013 IEEE.","multi-task learning; Natural language processing; offensive language; sentiment analysis; Spanish hate speech","Multi-task learning; Sentiment analysis; Speech; Automatic method; Community IS; Emotion classification; NAtural language processing; Social media platforms; Speech detection; Speech recognition","ERDF","Pang, B., Foundations and trends in information retrieval (2008) Found.

Of particular interest is the role that Twitter plays in the facilitation of political discourse. To this end, the existing literature argues that a healthy political discussion space is key to maintaining a trusting and robust democratic society. Using Suler’s online disinhibition effect as a theoretical orientation, this study seeks to address the extent of incivility on Twitter in discourse regarding the top three 2020 Democratic primary candidates. A total corpus of 18,237,296 tweets was analyzed in an effort to assess the extent to which incivility dominated Twitter discourse surrounding these candidates. Our results reveal that tweets that mention Senator Elizabeth Warren were associated with higher levels of uncivil discourse than tweets that mentioned Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. Interestingly, there does not appear to be a relationship with anonymity and incivility, as uncivil tweets were just as likely to originate from tweets that identified users’ names as they were to originate from anonymous or pseudonymous accounts. Finally, our findings provide evidence that certain policy issues are more closely related to uncivil discourse than others. Through the use of k-means clustering, our findings illustrate that the issue of gun control and immigration is closely related with mentions of Warren and fiscal policy with Sanders; however, we did not find any policy keywords linked to Biden. © The Author(s) 2021.","anonymity; incivility; online disinhibition effect; twitter",,,"Albadi, N., Kurdi, M., Mishra, S., Hateful people or hateful bots?

While many automatic methods have been proposed and achieve good accuracies, most of these focus on the English language, and are hard to apply directly to languages in which few labeled datasets exist. Recent work has therefore investigated the use of cross-lingual transfer learning to solve this problem, training a model in a well-resourced language and transferring to a less-resourced target language; but performance has so far been significantly less impressive. In this paper, we investigate the reasons for this performance drop, via a systematic comparison of pre-trained models and intermediate training regimes on five different languages. We show that using a better pre-trained language model results in a large gain in overall performance and in zero-shot transfer, and that intermediate training on other languages is effective when little target-language data is available. We then use multiple analyses of classifier confidence and language model vocabulary to shed light on exactly where these gains come from and gain insight into the sources of the most typical mistakes. © 2021 Pelicon et al.

With online hate speech on the rise, its automatic detection as a natural language processing task is gaining increasing interest. However, it is only recently that it has been shown that existing models generalise poorly to unseen data. This survey paper attempts to summarise how generalisable existing hate speech detection models are and the reasons why hate speech models struggle to generalise, sums up existing attempts at addressing the main obstacles, and then proposes directions of future research to improve generalisation in hate speech detection. © 2021.

We provide a new dataset of ~40, 000 entries, generated and labelled by trained annotators over four rounds of dynamic data creation. It includes ~15, 000 challenging perturbations and each hateful entry has fine-grained labels for the type and target of hate. Hateful entries make up 54% of the dataset, which is substantially higher than comparable datasets. We show that model performance is substantially improved using this approach. Models trained on later rounds of data collection perform better on test sets and are harder for annotators to trick. They also have better performance on HATECHECK, a suite of functional tests for online hate detection.

However, language models capture and proliferate hurtful stereotypes, especially in text generation. Our results show that 4.3% of the time, language models complete a sentence with a hurtful word. These cases are not random, but follow language and gender-specific patterns. We propose a score to measure hurtful sentence completions in language models (HONEST). It uses a systematic template- and lexicon-based bias evaluation methodology for six languages. Our findings suggest that these models replicate and amplify deep-seated societal stereotypes about gender roles. Sentence completions refer to sexual promiscuity when the target is female in 9% of the time, and in 4% to homosexuality when the target is male. The results raise questions about the use of these models in production settings. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Evaluation methodologies; Gender roles; Language model; Lexicon-based; Sentence completions; Template-based; Text generations; Computational linguistics","H2020; ERC; ","(2017) Proceedings of the First ACL Workshop on Ethics in Natural Language Processing, , Association for Computational Linguistics, Valencia, Spain; (2019) Proceedings of the First Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing, , Association for Computational Linguistics, Florence, Italy; Bassignana, Elisa, Basile, Valerio, Patti, Viviana, Hurtlex: A multilingual lexicon of words to hurt (2018) Proceedings of the 5th Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics, CLiC-it 2018, 2253, pp. 1-6. , pages CEUR-WS; Bender, Emily M., Friedman, Batya, Data statements for natural language processing: Toward mitigating system bias and enabling better science (2018) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6, pp. 587-604; Bender, Emily M., Koller, Alexander, Climbing towards NLU: On meaning, form, and understanding in the age of data (2020) Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 5185-5198. , Online.

They are commonly identified using classifiers solely based on textual content that generalize pre-agreed meanings of difficult problems. Such models provide the same results for each user, which leads to high misclassification rate observable especially for contentious, aggressive documents. Both document controversy and user nonconformity require new solutions. Therefore, we propose novel personalized approaches that respect individual beliefs expressed by either user conformity-based measures or various embeddings of their previous text annotations. We found that only a few annotations of most controversial documents are enough for all our personalization methods to significantly outperform classic, generalized solutions. The more controversial the content, the greater the gain. The personalized solutions may be used to efficiently filter unwanted aggressive content in the way adjusted to a given person. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Embeddings; Generalized solution; Misclassification rates; New solutions; Personalizations; Text annotations; Textual content","NCN; MNiSW; ERDF","Akhtar, Sohail, Basile, Valerio, Patti, Viviana, Modeling annotator perspective and polarized opinions to improve hate speech detection (2020) Proceedings of the Eighth AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing, pp. 151-154; Alrehili, A., Automatic hate speech detection on social media: A brief survey (2019) 2019 IEEE/ACS 16th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), pp. 1-6; Aroyo, Lora, Welty, Chris, (2013) Harnessing disagreement in crowdsourcing a relation extraction gold standard, , Technical report, Technical Report; Augustyniak, Lukasz, Kajdanowicz, Tomasz, Kazienko, Przemyslaw, Comprehensive analysis of aspect term extraction methods using various text embeddings (2021) Computer Speech & Language, 69, p. 101217; Augustyniak, Lukasz, Kajdanowicz, Tomasz, Kazienko, Przemyslaw, Aspect detection using word and char embeddings with (bi) lstm and crf (2019) 2019 IEEE Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (AIKE), pp. 43-50. , IEEE; Ben-David, Anat, Fernández, Ariadna Matamoros, Hate speech and covert discrimination on social media: Monitoring the facebook pages of extreme-right political parties in spain (2016) International Journal of Communication, 10, p. 27; Bloehdorn, Stephan, Hotho, Andreas, Text classification by boosting weak learners based on terms and concepts (2004) Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'04), pp. 331-334. , IEEE; Bojanowski, Piotr, Grave, Edouard, Joulin, Armand, Mikolov, Tomas, Enriching word vectors with subword information (2017) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146; Breckheimer, Peter J, A haven for hate: the foreign and domestic implications of protecting internet hate speech under the first amendment (2001) S.

The dataset consists of 6,567 labels for Reddit posts and comments. As previous research has found untrained crowdsourced annotators struggle with identifying misogyny, we hired and trained annotators and provided them with robust annotation guidelines.

Online social network (OSN) platforms intensify this problem by allowing their users to easily distort and fabri-cate the information and disseminate it farther and rapidly. In this paper, we study the impact of misinformation associated with a religious inflection on the psychology and behavior of the OSN users. The article presents a detailed study to understand the reaction of social media users when exposed to unverified content related to the Islamic community during the COVID-19 lockdown period in India. The analysis was carried out on Twitter users where the data were collected using three scraping packages, Tweepy, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup, to cover more users affected by this misinformation. A labeled dataset is prepared where each tweet is assigned one of the four reaction polarities, namely, E (endorse), D (deny), Q (question), and N (neutral). Analysis of collected data was carried out in five phases where we investigate the engagement of E, D, Q, and N users, tone of the tweets, and the consequence upon repeated exposure of such information. The evidence demonstrates that the circulation of such content during the pandemic and lockdown phase had made people more vulnerable in perceiving the unreliable tweets as fact. It was also observed that people absorbed the negativity of the online content, which induced a feeling of hatred, anger, distress, and fear among them. People with similar mindset form online groups and express their negative attitude to other groups based on their opinions, indicating the strong signals of social unrest and public tensions in society. The paper also presents a deep learning-based stance detection model as one of the automated mechanisms for tracking the news on Twitter as being potentially false. Stance classifier aims to predict the attitude of a tweet towards a news headline and thereby assists in determining the veracity of news by monitoring the distribution of different reactions of the users towards it. The proposed model, employing deep learning (convolutional neural network (CNN)) and sentence embedding (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)) techniques, outperforms the existing systems. The performance is evaluated on the benchmark SemEval stance dataset. Furthermore, a newly annotated dataset is prepared and released with this study to help the research of this domain. © 2020 by the authors.

One of the most frequently targeted groups comprise women, as misogyny is, unfortunately, a reality in our society. However, although great efforts have recently been made to identify misogyny, it is still difficult to distinguish as it can sometimes be very subtle and deep, signifying that the use of statistical approaches is not sufficient. Moreover, as Spanish is spoken worldwide, context and cultural differences can complicate this identification. Our contribution to the detection of misogyny in Spanish is two-fold. On the one hand, we apply Sentiment Analysis and Social Computing technologies for detecting misogynous messages in Twitter. On the other, we have compiled the Spanish MisoCorpus-2020, a balanced corpus regarding misogyny in Spanish, and classified it into three subsets concerning (1) violence towards relevant women, (2) messages harassing women in Spanish from Spain and Spanish from Latin America, and (3) general traits related to misogyny. Our proposal combines a classification based on average word embeddings and linguistic features in order to understand which linguistic phenomena principally contribute to the identification of misogyny. We have evaluated our proposal with three machine-learning classifiers, achieving the best accuracy of 85.175%. Finally the proposed approach is also validated with existing corpora for misogyny and aggressiveness detection such as AMI and HatEval obtaining good results © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Machine-learning; Misogyny detection; Natural language processing; Text classification","Classification (of information); Embeddings; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Cultural difference; Latin America; Linguistic features; Linguistic phenomena; On-line social networks; Social computing technologies; Social distance; Statistical approach; Linguistics","FEDER; AEI","Duggan, M., Online Harassment 2017: Tech. rep.

Mainly about cyberbullying, detection of language patterns through supervised algorithms, a few works on unsupervised learning, and some on violence against women. This article is part of a larger investigation related to the Violence Against Women in Digital Space phenomena in Mexico from Spanish-language interactions in microblogging social network, Twitter. We present the framework to address these phenomena from a Data Science perspective and go through some first stage results.

Misogynistic speech is a kind of abusive language, which can be simplified as hate speech targeting women, and it is becoming a more and more relevant issue in recent years. AMI IberEval 2018 and AMI EVALITA 2018 were two shared tasks which mainly focused on tackling the problem of misogyny in Twitter, in three different languages, namely English, Italian, and Spanish. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on the phenomena of misogyny in those three languages, by focusing on three main objectives. Firstly, we investigate the most important features to detect misogyny and the issues which contribute to the difficulty of misogyny detection, by proposing a novel system and conducting a broad evaluation on this task. Secondly, we study the relationship between misogyny and other abusive language phenomena, by conducting a series of cross-domain classification experiments. Finally, we explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny in a multilingual environment, by carrying out cross-lingual classification experiments. Our system succeeded to outperform all state of the art systems in all benchmark AMI datasets both subtask A and subtask B. Moreover, intriguing insights emerged from error analysis, in particular about the interaction between different but related abusive phenomena. Based on our cross-domain experiment, we conclude that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while we experimentally found that it is different from sexism. Lastly, our cross-lingual experiments show promising results. Our proposed joint-learning architecture obtained a robust performance across languages, worth to be explored in further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive language online; Automatic misogyny identification; Cross-domain classification; Cross-lingual classification; Social media","Data processing; Information management; Cross-domain; Cross-lingual; Important features; In-depth study; Joint learning; Multilingual environments; Robust performance; State-of-the-art system; Social networking (online)",,"Ahluwalia, R., Soni, H., Callow, E., Nascimento, A.C.A., Cock, M.D., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets (2018) Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-6. , T.

Gender equality offices in universities and public administration cannot cope with the task of manually checking the use of non-inclusive language in the documentation that those institutions generate. In this research, an automated solution for the detection of non-inclusive uses of the Spanish language in doctoral theses generated in Spanish universities is introduced using machine learning techniques. A large dataset has been used to train, validate, and analyze the use of inclusive language; the result is an algorithm that detects, within any Spanish text document, non-inclusive uses of the language with error, false positive, and false negative ratios slightly over 10%, and precision, recall, and F-measure percentages over 86%. Results also show the evolution with time of the ratio of non-inclusive usages per document, having a pronounced reduction in the last years under study. © 2020 by the authors.","Classification algorithm; Inclusive language; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Spanish language",,"","Wasserman, B.D., Weseley, A.J., Qué Quoi Do languages with grammatical gender promote sexist attitudes (2009) Sex Roles, 61, p. 634; Meseguer, Á.G., (1996) Es Sexista La Lengua Española?

With the increase in the use of social media, this feeling of hatred toward women and immigrants can be more easily expressed, and therefore it can have harmful effects on social media users. For this reason, it is important to develop systems capable of detecting hateful comments automatically.

While critical scholars posit that online gender harassment may be linked to men's anxieties about fulfilling normative masculine gender roles, this relationship has not been examined by empirical research. We survey 264 young men between the ages of 18-24 about their masculinity anxieties and their perceptions of harassment directed at a woman on Twitter. We find that men who perceive themselves as less masculine than average men report higher endorsement of harassment. Further, we find that the relationship between masculinity anxieties and harassment endorsement is mediated by men's adherence to masculine norms and toxic disinhibition. We interpret these results through the lens of social media's specific affordances, and we discuss their implications for technology designers and other practitioners who wish to better detect, prevent, and remediate online harassment by accounting for the role of gender. © 2020 ACM.","gender; masculinity; misogyny; online harassment; social media; women","Human engineering; Affordances; Disinhibition; Empirical research; Gender roles; Online environments; Social media; Through the lens; Social networking (online)",,"(2018) Toxic Twitter-Triggers of Violence and Abuse Against Women on Twitter, , https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/03/online-violence-against-women-chapter-2/, Amnesty International Retrieved September 16 2019 from; Jensen Arnett, J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55 (5), pp. 469-480. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.55.5.469; Banet-Weiser, S., Miltner, K.M., #masculinitysofragile: Culture, structure, and networked misogyny (2016) Feminist Media Studies, 16 (1), pp. 171-174. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2016.1120490; Barlett, J., Norrie, R., Patel, N., Rumpel, R., Wibberley, Misogyny on twitter (2014) Demos, , https://www.demos.co.uk/project/misogyny-on-twitter/, Retrieved December 15 2017 from; Berke, D.S., Reidy, D.E., Miller, J.D., Zeichner, A., Take it like a man: Gender-threatened men's experience of gender role discrepancy, emotion activation, and pain tolerance (2017) Psychology of Men & Masculinity, 18 (1), pp. 62-69. , https://doi.org/10.1037/men0000036; Blackwell, L., Chen, T., Schoenebeck, S., Lampe, C., When online harassment is perceived as justified (2018) Twelfth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media; Blackwell, L., Dimond, J., Schoenebeck, S., Lampe, C., Classification and its consequences for online harassment: Design insights from heartmob (2017) Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction 1, CSCW, pp. 1-19. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3134659; Braithwaite, A., It's about ethics in games journalism?

This study deals with automatic cyberbullying detection mechanism tapping into Twitter users’ psychological features including personalities, sentiment and emotion. User personalities were determined using Big Five and Dark Triad models, whereas machine learning classifiers namely, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and J48 were used to classify the tweets into one of four categories: bully, aggressor, spammer and normal. The Twitter dataset contained 5453 tweets gathered using the hashtag #Gamergate, and manually annotated by human experts. Selected Twitter-based features namely text, user and network-based features were used as the baseline algorithm. Results show that cyberbullying detection improved when personalities and sentiments were used, however, a similar effect was not observed for emotion. A further analysis on the personalities revealed extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and psychopathy to have greater impacts in detecting online bullying compared to other traits. Key features were identified using the dimension reduction technique, and integrated into a single model, which produced the best detection accuracy. The paper describes suggestions and recommendations as to how the findings can be applied to mitigate cyberbullying. © 2020","Cyberbullying; Emotion; Machine learning; Personality; Sentiment; Twitter","Computer crime; Decision trees; Learning systems; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Cyber bullying; Emotion; Personality; Sentiment; Twitter; Feature extraction",,"Al-garadi, M.A., Varathan, K.D., Ravana, S.D., Cybercrime detection in online communications: the experimental case of cyberbullying detection in the Twitter network (2016) Comput.

The exposure to sexist speech has serious consequences to women's life and limits their freedom of speech. Previous studies have focused on identifying hatred or violence towards women. However, sexism is expressed in very different forms: it includes subtle stereotypes and attitudes that, although frequently unnoticed, are extremely harmful for both women and society. In this work, we propose a new task that aims to understand and analyze how sexism, from explicit hate or violence to subtle expressions, is expressed in online conversations. To this end, we have developed and released the first dataset of sexist expressions and attitudes in Twitter in Spanish (MeTwo) and investigate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques (both traditional and novel deep learning models) for automatically detecting different types of sexist behaviours. Our results show that sexism is frequently found in many forms in social networks, that it includes a wide range of behaviours, and that it is possible to detect them using deep learning approaches. We discuss the performance of automatic classification methods to deal with different types of sexism and the generalizability of our task to other subdomains, such as misogyny. © 2013 IEEE.","machine learning; natural language processing; Sexism detection; social media",,,"Wright, M.F., Harper, B.D., Wachs, S., The associations between cyberbullying and callous-unemotional traits among adolescents: The moderating effect of online disinhibition (2019) J.

Several studies have been recently published investigating methods to detect the various forms of such content (e.g. hate speech, cyberbulling, and cyberaggression). The clear majority of these studies deal with English partially because most annotated datasets available contain English data. In this paper, we take advantage of English data available by applying cross-lingual contextual word embeddings and transfer learning to make predictions in languages with less resources. We project predictions on comparable data in Bengali, Hindi, and Spanish and we report results of 0.8415 F1 macro for Bengali, 0.8568 F1 macro for Hindi, and 0.7513 F1 macro for Spanish. Finally, we show that our approach compares favorably to the best systems submitted to recent shared tasks on these three languages, confirming the robustness of cross-lingual contextual embeddings and transfer learning for this task. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics;

However, such embeddings are usually trained on generic corpora, while text classification tasks are often domain-specific. We propose a fully automated method to adapt pre-trained word embeddings to any given classification task, that needs no additional resource other than the original training set. The method is based on the concept of word weirdness, extended to score the words in the training set according to how characteristic they are with respect to the labels of a text classification dataset. The polarized weirdness scores are then used to update the word embeddings to reflect task-specific semantic shifts. Our experiments show that this method is beneficial to the performance of several text classification tasks in different languages.

Given the rising number of experiences of sexism reported online, categorizing these recollections automatically can aid the fight against sexism, as it can facilitate effective analyses by gender studies researchers and government officials involved in policy making. In this paper, we explore the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism wherein the approach goes beyond merely fine-tuning pre-trained models using unlabeled data. We devise self-training based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. Several proposed methods outperform a variety of baselines on a recently released dataset for multi-label sexism categorization across several standard metrics. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fine-grained categorization; Multi-label classification; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification","Classification (of information); Information systems; Information use; Systems engineering; Class imbalance; Effective analysis; Government officials; Multi label classification; Problem formulation; Semi-supervised; Standard metrics; Unlabeled samples; Semi-supervised learning",,"Abney, S., (2007) Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics, , Chapman and Hall/CRC, Boca Raton; Agrawal, S., Awekar, A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms (2018) ECIR 2018.

Due to the amount of content created on these platforms, spotting hate comments individually becomes an impossible task, and automatic hate speech detectors take place on those tasks. Furthermore, identifying hate speech towards women is specially complex due to the cultural background and the subtlety that characterizes it, which makes it interesting to consider it as a phenomenon by itself, differentiating it from traditional hate speech. Our contribution to automatic misogyny identification entails the creation of a machine-learning model based on linguistic and morphological features, applied to the training set of corpus developed at the Automatic Misogyny Evaluation task which contains 3307 tweets written in Spanish. We evaluate our proposal with different machine-learning classifiers achieving the best accuracy of 77% applying Support Vector Machines. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Misogyny detection; Natural Language Processing; Text classification","Linguistics; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Turing machines; Cultural backgrounds; Machine learning models; Morphological features; Positive features; Social media; Training sets; Learning systems","FEDER; AEI","Aiyar, S., Shetty, N.P., N-Gram assisted Youtube spam comment detection (2018) Procedia Comput.

Emotion mining is a relatively recent task that attempts to identify different emotional categories in text. However, due to its complexity and the limited availability of annotated lexical resources, it is still in the early stages of research. In addition, most of the work and resources have been focus on English texts, but the presence of other languages, such as Spanish, is growing on the Web. Therefore, in this work, we describe a thesis project that will focus on the development of emotion recognition systems in Spanish texts. In addition, we aim to use these systems to solve other relevant tasks, such as, hate speech identification on social media or mental disorders detection. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

Tackling hate speech in the standard way of content deletion or user suspension may be charged with censorship and overblocking. One alternate strategy, that has received little attention so far by the research community, is to actually oppose hate content with counter-narratives (i.e. informed textual responses). In this paper, we describe the creation of the first large-scale, multilingual, expert-based dataset of hate speech/counter-narrative pairs. This dataset has been built with the effort of more than 100 operators from three different NGOs that applied their training and expertise to the task. Together with the collected data we also provide additional annotations about expert demographics, hate and response type, and data augmentation through translation and paraphrasing. Finally, we provide initial experiments to assess the quality of our data. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Personnel training; Data augmentation; Research communities; Social media platforms; Large dataset",,"Ahluwalia, R., Shcherbinina, E., Callow, E., Nascimento, A., de Cock, M., Detecting misogynous tweets (2018) Proc.

However, sexism as a form of discrimination towards women spread exponentially through the web and at a very high frequency, especially in the form of memes. Memes, which are typically composed of pictorial and textual components, can convey messages ranging from women stereotype, shaming, objectification to violence. In order to counterattack this phenomenon, in this paper we give a first insight in the field of automatic detection of sexist memes, by investigating both unimodal and multimodal approaches to understand the contribution of textual and visual cues. © 2019 IEEE.","Cybersexism; Early Fusion vs Late Fusion; Meme; Unimodal vs Multimodal","Computer programming; Computer science; Automatic Detection; Cybersexism; Late fusion; Meme; Multi-modal; Multi-modal approach; Very high frequency; Women stereotypes; Intelligent computing","","Khatua, A., Cambria, E., Khatua, A., Sounds of silence breakers: Exploring sexual violence on twitter (2018) IEEE ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), pp. 397-400; Ging, D., Siapera, E., Special issue on online misogyny (2018) Feminist Media Studies, 18 (4), pp. 515-524; Gasparini, F., Erba, I., Fersini, E., Corchs, S., Multimodal classification of sexist advertisements (2018) Proceedings of the 15th International Joint Conference on E-Business and Telecommunications; Glick, P., Fiske, S.T., The ambivalent sexism inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70 (3), p. 491; Bianco, S., Gasparini, F., Schettini, R., Adaptive skin classification using face and body detection (2015) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 24 (12), pp. 4756-4765; Anzovino, M., Fersini, E., Rosso, P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter (2018) NLDB, 2018; Tamura, H., Mori, S., Yamawaki, T., Textual features corresponding to visual perception (1978) Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 8 (6), pp. 460-473; Mack, M., Oliva, A., Computational estimation of visual complexity (2004) The 12th Annual Object, Perception, Attention, and Memory Conference; Schettini, R., Gasparini, F., Corchs, S., Marini, F., Capra, A., Castorina, A., Contrast image correction method (2010) Journal of Electronic Imaging, 19 (2), p. 023005; Ojala, T., Pietikainen, M., Harwood, D., A comparative study of texture measures with classification based on featured distributions (1996) Pattern Recognition, 29 (1), pp. 51-59; Junior, O.L., Delgado, D., Goncalves, V., Nunes, U., Trainable classifier-fusion schemes: An ap-plication to pedestrian detection (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2009.

Focusing on the social media and microblogging site Twitter, we analyze a corpus of over 20,000 tweets containing these hashtags to examine how discourses of gender politics and gender relations are represented on the site. More specifically, our analysis suggests that users include these hashtags in tweets to index their individual evaluations of, and assumptions about, “proper” gendered behavior. Consequently, their metadiscursive references to the respective phenomena reflect their beliefs of what constitutes appropriate (verbal) behavior and the extent to which gender is appropriated as a variable dictating this behavior. As such, this article adds to our knowledge of the ways in which gendered social practices become sites of contestation and how contemporary gender politics play out in social media sites. © The Author(s) 2019.","corpus linguistics; gender politics; hashtags; mansplaining; manspreading; manterruption; Twitter",,,"Ahluwalia, R., Madrid bans manspreading on public transport (2017) The Independent, , https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/mandspreading-madrid-spain-ban-public-transport-bus-metro-behaviour-etiquette-a7779041.html, June, 8, (,)., Retrieved from; Almukhtar, S., Gold, M., Buchanan, L., After Weinstein: 71 men accused of sexual misconduct and their fall from power (2018) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/us/men-accused-sexual-misconduct-weinstein.html, February, 8, (,)., Retrieved from; Anderson, K.J., Leaper, C., Meta-analyses of gender effects on conversational interruption: Who, what, when, where, and how (1998) Sex Roles, 39, pp. 225-252; Baker, P., (2006) Using corpora in discourse analysis, , London, England, Bloomsbury; Banet-Weiser, S., Miltner, K.M., #MasculinitySoFragile: Culture, structure, and networked misogyny (2016) Feminist Media Studies, 16, pp. 171-174; Barker, P., Mansplaining is something men and women are guilty of doing (2018) Stuff, , https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/103141530/mansplaining-is-something-men-and-women-are-guilty-of-doing, April, 16, (,)., Retrieved from; Blommaert, J., Meaning as a nonlinear effect: The birth of cool (2015) AILA Review, 28, pp. 7-27; Blommaert, J., Varis, P., Conviviality and collectives on social media: Virality, memes, and new social structures (2017) Multilingual Margins, 2, pp. 31-45; Boyajian, M., Women try manspreading for a week (2016) Buzzfeed, , https://www.buzzfeed.com/melissaboyajian/women-try-manspreading-for-a-week, November, 22, (,)., Retrieved from; Bridges, J., Gendering metapragmatics in online discourse: “Mansplaining man gonna mansplain..

The HatEval shared task was created with this in mind; participants were expected to develop a model capable of determining whether or not input (in this case, Twitter posts in English and Spanish) could be considered hate speech (designated as Subtask A), if they were aggressive, and whether the tweet was targeting an individual, or speaking generally (Subtask B). We approached this Subtask by creating a LSTM model with an embedding layer. We found that our model performed considerably better on English language input when compared to Spanish language input. In English, we achieved an F1-Score of 0.466 for Subtask A and 0.462 for Subtask B; In Spanish, we achieved scores of 0.617 and 0.612 on Subtask A and Subtask B, respectively. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Semantics; Speech; Speech recognition; Embeddings; English languages; F1 scores; Hot topics; Online forums; Online platforms; Spanish language; Speech detection; Subtask; Twitter posts; Long short-term memory",,"Álvarez-Carmona, M.

Online automatic hate speech detection in various aspects is a significant scientific problem. This paper presents the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (Mexico) approach for the Semeval 2019 Task-5 [Hateval 2019] (Basile et al., 2019) competition for Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech on Twitter. The goal of this paper is to detect (A) Hate speech against immigrants and women, (B) Aggressive behavior and target classification, both for English and Spanish. In the proposed approach, we used a bag of words model with preprocessing (stemming and stop words removal). We submitted two different systems with names: (i) CIC-1 and (ii) CIC-2 for Hateval 2019 shared task. We used TF values in the first system and TF-IDF for the second system. The first system, CIC-1 got 2nd rank in subtask B for both English and Spanish languages with EMR score of 0.568 for English and 0.675 for Spanish. The second system, CIC-2 was ranked 4th in subtask A and 1st in subtask B for Spanish language with a macro-F1 score of 0.727 and EMR score of 0.705 respectively. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Speech; Speech communication; Speech recognition; Behavior detection; Behaviour classification; First systems; Me-xico; Simple++; Social media; Spanish language; Speech detection; Subtask; Target Classification; Social networking (online)","CONACYT; SNI","Xu, Jun-Ming, Jun, Kwang-Sung, Zhu, Xiaojin, Bellmore, Amy, Learning from bullying traces in social media (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 Conference of North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT), pp. 656-666. , Montreal, Canada; Nobata, Chikashi, Tetreault, Joel, Thomas, Achint, Mehdad, Yashar, Chang, Yi, Abusive language detection in online user content (2016) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 145-153. , Geneva, Switzerland; Blei, David M., Ng, Andrew Y., Jordan, Michael I., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (Jan), pp. 993-1022; Ging, Debbie, Siapera, Eugenia, Special issue on online misogyny (2018) Feminist Media Studies, pp. 515-524. , (eds). pages; Fersini, Elisabetta, Nozza, Debora, Rosso, Paolo, Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (ami) (2018) Proceedings of the 6th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian (EVALITA'18), , CEUR.org, Turin, Italy; Sidorov, Grigori, (2019) Syntactic N-grams in Computational Linguistics, p. 125. , Springer; Sidorov, Grigori, Non-linear Construction of N-grams in Computational Linguistics] (2013) Sociedad Mexicana de Inteligencia Artificial, p. 166. , Construcció lineal de ngramas en la lingüística computacional; Gómez-Adorno, Helena, Posadas-Durán, Juan-Pablo, Sidorov, Grigori, Pinto, David, Document embeddings learned on various types of n-grams for cross-topic authorship attribution (2018) Computing, pp. 1-16; Markov, Ilia, Stamatatos, Efstathios, Sidorov, Grigori, Improving Cross-Topic Authorship Attribution: The Role of Pre-Processing (2017) Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing (CICLing 2017), , Budapest, Hungary.

The growing interest is confirmed by the large number of benchmark corpora for different languages developed in the latest years. However, abusive language behaviour is multifaceted and available datasets are featured by different topical focuses. This makes abusive language detection a domain-dependent task, and building a robust system to detect general abusive content a first challenge. Moreover, most resources are available for English, which makes detecting abusive language in low-resource languages a further challenge. We address both challenges by considering ten publicly available datasets across different domains and languages. A hybrid approach with deep learning and a multilingual lexicon to cross-domain and cross-lingual detection of abusive content is proposed and compared with other simpler models. We show that training a system on general abusive language datasets will produce a cross-domain robust system, which can be used to detect other more specific types of abusive content. We also found that using the domain-independent lexicon HurtLex is useful to transfer knowledge between domains and languages. In the cross-lingual experiment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our jointlearning model also in out-domain scenarios. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Dependent tasks; Different domains; Domain independents; Hybrid approach; Language detection; Low resource languages; Multilingual context; Multilingual lexicons; Deep learning",,"Basile, A., Rubagotti, C., Crotonemilano for AMI at evalita2018.

Unfortunately, this has also resulted in the massive rise of uncensored online hate against vulnerable communities such as immigrants, LGBT and women. Current work on the automatic detection of various forms of hate speech (HS) typically employs supervised learning, requiring manually annotated data. The highly polarizing nature of the topics involved raises concerns about the quality of annotations these systems rely on, because not all the annotators are equally sensitive to different kinds of hate speech. We propose an approach to leverage the fine-grained knowledge expressed by individual annotators, before their subjectivity is averaged out by the gold standard creation process. This helps us to refine the quality of training sets for hate speech detection. We introduce a measure of polarization at the level of single instances in the data to manipulate the training set and reduce the impact of most polarizing text on the learning process. We test our approach on three datasets, in English and Italian, annotated by experts and workers hired on a crowdsourcing platform. We classify instances of sexist, racist, and homophobic hate speech in tweets and show how our approach improves the prediction performance of a supervised classifier. Moreover, the proposed polarization measure helps towards the manual exploration of the individual instances of tweets in our datasets. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data augmentation; Hate speech detection; Inter-rater agreement; Linguistic annotation","Artificial intelligence; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Polarization; Speech; Crowdsourcing platforms; Data augmentation; Inter-rater agreements; Linguistic annotations; Prediction performance; Speech detection; Supervised classifiers; Vulnerable communities; Speech recognition",,"Abbondante, F., Il ruolo dei social network nella lotta all’hate speech: Un’analisi comparata fra l’esperienza statunitense e quella europea (2017) Informatica E Diritto, 26 (1-2), pp. 41-68; Artstein, R., Poesio, M., Inter-coder agreement for computational linguistics (2008) Comput.

In this paper I unmask how memes perpetuate existing gender power structures in spaces where users are only known by pseudonyms. The site of study is the r/AdviceAnimals forum of Reddit, in which a popular genre of memes known as Advice Animals are shared by users. Using a cross-section of Advice Animal memes submitted to this forum, the study examines the uneven distribution of power in representations of gender and feminists. I find that while women are highly sexualised, obsessive, and clingy, male characters are a default central character, used to express non-specific ideals of behaivour. As feminists, men are portrayed as legitimate, whilst women-feminists are epitomised as hypocritical, demanding, ""Nazis"". The main contribution of the article is highlighting the gendered nature of memes, and call attention to the unequal representation in pseudonymous space. © First Monday, 1995-2019.",,,,"Ahmed, S., Killing joy: Feminism and the history of happiness (2010) Signs, 35 (3), pp. 571-594. , https://doi.org/10.1086/648513, accessed 25 September 2019; Baxter, J., (2003) Positioning gender in discourse: A feminist methodology, , Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan; Bennett, J., The agency of assemblages (2010) Vibrant matter: A political ecology of things, , https://doi.org/10.1215/9780822391623-002, In:J.

We found that women scholars rely on three levels of support: the first level includes personal and social support (such as encouragement from friends and family and outsourcing comment reading to others); the second includes organizational (such as university or institutional policy), technological (such as reporting tools on Twitter or Facebook), and sectoral (such as law enforcement) support; and, the third includes larger cultural and social attitudes and discourses (such as attitudes around gendered harassment and perceptions of the online/offline divide). While participants relied on social and personal support most frequently, they commonly reported relying on multiple supports across all three levels. We use an ecological model as our framework to demonstrate how different types of support are interconnected, and recommend that support for targets of online abuse must integrate aspects of all three levels. © First Monday.",,,,"Barbour, K., Marshall, D., 'The academic online: Constructing persona through the World Wide Web,' (2012) First Monday, 17 (9). , http://firstmonday.org/article/view/3969/3292,https://doi.org/10.5210/fm.v0i0.3969, accessed 7 July 2018, accessed 4 May 2018;

How do we make sense of how apps like these-and thousands of others-have embedded themselves into our daily routines, permeating the background of ordinary life and standing at-the-ready to be used on our smartphones and tablets? When we look at any single app, it’s hard to imagine how such a small piece of software could be particularly notable. But if we look at a collection of them, we see a bigger picture that reveals how the quotidian activities apps encompass are far from banal: connecting with friends (and strangers and enemies), sharing memories (and personally identifying information), making art (and trash), navigating spaces (and reshaping places in the process). While the sheer number of apps is overwhelming, as are the range of activities they address, each one offers an opportunity for us to seek out meaning in the mundane. Appified is the first scholarly volume to examine individual apps within the wider historical and cultural context of media and cultural studies scholarship, attuned to issues of politics and power, identity and the everyday. © 2018 by Jeremy Wade Morris and Sarah Murray.

The models are based on a Support Vector Machine and they use n-grams as features. Our solution is very simple and yet we achieve top results on Italian Tweets and excellent results on English Tweets. Furthermore, we experiment with a single model that works across languages by leveraging abstract features. We show that a single multilingual system yields performances comparable to two independently trained systems. We achieve accuracy results ranging from 45% to 85%.

Considering the encouraging results obtained for Spanish and English in the precedent edition of AMI, in the EVALITA framework we tested the robustness of a similar approach based on topic and stylistic information on a new collection of Italian and English tweets. Moreover, to deal with the dynamism of the language on social platforms, we also propose an approach based on automatically-enriched lexica. Despite resources like the lexica prove to be useful for a specific domain like misogyny, the analysis of the results reveals the limitations of the proposed approaches. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

The AMI challenge, based on both Italian and English tweets, is distinguished into two subtasks, i.e. Subtask A on misogyny identification and Subtask B about misogynistic behaviour categorization and target classification. Regarding the Italian language, we have received a total of 13 runs for Subtask A and 11 runs for Subtask B. Concerning the English language, we received 26 submissions for Subtask A and 23 runs for Subtask B. The participating systems have been distinguished according to the language, counting 6 teams for Italian and 10 teams for English. We present here an overview of the AMI shared task, the datasets, the evaluation methodology, the results obtained by the participants and a discussion of the methodology adopted by the teams. Finally, we draw some conclusions and discuss future work. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

For this reason, hate speech online is a real problem in modern society and the necessity of control of user-generated contents has become one of the priorities for governments, social media platforms and Internet companies. Current methodologies are far from solving this problem. Indeed, several aggressive comments are also disguised as sarcastic. In this perspective, this research proposal wants to investigate the role played by creative linguistic devices, especially sarcasm, in hate speech in multilingual context. © 2011 CEUR-WS.

Unlike other studies, this book sees the robot in relation to Japanese popular culture, and argues that the Japanese ‘affinity’ for robots is the outcome of a complex loop of representation and social expectation in the context of Japan’s continuing struggle with modernity. Considering Japanese robot culture from the critical perspectives afforded by theatre and performance studies, this book is concerned with representations of robots and their inclusion in social and cultural contexts, which science and engineering studies do not address. The robot as a performing object generates meaning in staged events and situations that make sense for its Japanese observers and participants. This book examines how specific modes of encounter with robots in carefully constructed mises en scène can trigger reflexive, culturally specific, and often ideologically-inflected responses. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",,,,"Allison, A., (2006) Millennial monsters Japanese toys and the global imagination, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Aramata, H., (1996) Daitōa kagaku kitan [Mysterious science stories in Greater Asia], , Tokyo: Chikuma Shobō; Arjomand, M., Mosse, R., Editors’ preface (2014) The Routledge introduction to theatre and performance studies, , M.
