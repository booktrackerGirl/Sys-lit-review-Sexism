We proposed two hierarchical subtasks: For subtask 1, participants had to determine the presence of stereotypes in sentences. For subtask 2, participants had to classify the sentences labeled with stereotypes into ten categories. The DETESTS dataset contains 5,629 sentences in comments in response to newspaper articles related to immigration in Spanish. 51 teams signed up to participate, of which 39 sent runs, and 5 of them sent their working notes. In this paper, we provide information about the training and test datasets, the systems used by the participants, the evaluation metrics of the systems and their results. © 2022 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.","DETESTS dataset; evaluation metrics; Stereotype detection and classification",,"CSP; GVA","Allport, G.

We employ the technique of structural topic modelling (STM) to identify distinctions in the core topics of the letters, gauging the value of this relatively under-used methodology in forensic linguistics. Four key topics were identified in the letters, ‘Politics A’ and ‘B’, ‘Healthcare’ and ‘Immigration’, and their coherence, correlation and shifts in topic were evaluated. Following the STM, a qualitative corpus linguistic analysis was undertaken, coding concordance lines according to topic, with the reliability between coders tested. This coding demonstrated that various connected statements within the same topic tend to gain or lose prevalence over time, and ultimately confirmed the consistency of content within the four topics identified through STM throughout the letter series. The discussion and conclusions to the paper reflect on the findings and also consider the utility of these methodologies for linguistics and forensic linguistics in particular. The study demonstrates real value in revisiting a forensic linguistic dataset such as this to test and develop methodologies for the field. © Edinburgh University Press.","abusive letters; corpus linguistics; forensic linguistics; semantic tagging; topic modelling",,,"Anandarajan, M., Hill, C., Nolan, T., (2019) Practical Text Analytics: Maximizing the Value of Text Data, , Cham, Switzerland: Springer; Argamon, S., Koppel, M., Fine, J., Shimoni, AR., Gender, genre, and writing style in formal written texts (2003) Text – Interdisciplinary Journal for the Study of Discourse, 23 (3), pp. 321-346; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., McEnery, T., (2013) Discourse Analysis and Media Attitudes: The Representation of Islam in the British Press, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., KhosraviNik, M., Krzyzanowski, M., McEnery, T., Wodak, R., A useful methodological synergy?

The HateBR corpus was collected from the comment section of Brazilian politicians' accounts on Instagram and manually annotated by specialists, reaching a high inter-annotator agreement. The corpus consists of 7,000 documents annotated according to three different layers: a binary classification (offensive versus non-offensive comments), offensiveness-level classification (highly, moderately, and slightly offensive), and nine hate speech groups (xenophobia, racism, homophobia, sexism, religious intolerance, partyism, apology for the dictatorship, antisemitism, and fatphobia). We also implemented baseline experiments for offensive language and hate speech detection and compared them with a literature baseline. Results show that the baseline experiments on our corpus outperform the current state-of-the-art for the Portuguese language. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","corpus annotation; hate speech and offensive language detection; natural language processing","Information retrieval systems; Natural language processing systems; Corpus annotations; Hate speech and offensive language detection; Language detection; Language processing; Large-scales; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Offensive languages; Social media; Speech detection; Speech recognition","FAPESP; CNPq; FAPEMIG","Albadi, N., Kurdi, M., Mishra, S., Are they our brothers?

However, there are few benchmarks for Arabic misogyny and sexism detection, and in those the annotations are in aggregated form even though misogyny and sexism judgments are found to be highly subjective. In this paper we introduce an Arabic misogyny and sexism dataset (ArMIS) characterized by providing annotations from annotators with different degree of religious beliefs, and provide evidence that such differences do result in disagreements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to study in detail the effect of beliefs on misogyny and sexism annotation. We also discuss proof-of-concept experiments showing that a dataset in which disagreements have not been reconciled can be used to train state-of-the-art models for misogyny and sexism detection; and consider different ways in which such models could be evaluated. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","disagreement; misogyny; sexism; subjectivity","ART model; Disagreement; Misogyny; Proof of concept; Sexism; Social media; State of the art; Subjectivity","SACB; ERC","Akhtar, S., Basile, V., Patti, V., A new measure of polarization in the annotation of hate speech (2019) International Conference of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence, pp. 588-603. , Springer; Akhtar, S., Basile, V., Patti, V., Modeling annotator perspective and polarized opinions to improve hate speech detection (2020) Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing, 8, pp. 151-154; Al Kuwatly, H., Wich, M., Groh, G., Identifying and measuring annotator bias based on annotators' demographic characteristics (2020) Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms, pp. 184-190; Albadi, N., Kurdi, M., Mishra, S., Are they our brothers? analysis and detection of religious hate speech in the arabic twittersphere (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), pp. 69-76. , IEEE; Antoun, W., Baly, F., Hajj, H., AraBERT: Transformer-based model for Arabic language understanding (2020) Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Open-Source Arabic Corpora and Processing Tools, with a Shared Task on Offensive Language Detection, pp. 9-15. , Marseille, France, May.

The context, here, is defined by the conversational thread in which a specific comment occurs and also the “type” of discursive role that the comment is performing with respect to the previous comment. The initial dataset, being discussed here consists of a total 59,152 annotated comments in four languages - Meitei, Bangla, Hindi, and Indian English - collected from various social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Telegram. As is usual on social media websites, a large number of these comments are multilingual, mostly code-mixed with English. The paper gives a detailed description of the tagset being used for annotation and also the process of developing a multi-label, fine-grained tagset that has been used for marking comments with aggression and bias of various kinds including sexism (called gender bias in the tagset), religious intolerance (called communal bias in the tagset), class/caste bias and ethnic/racial bias. We also define and discuss the tags that have been used for marking the different discursive role being performed through the comments, such as attack, defend, etc. Finally we present a basic statistical analysis of the dataset.

Unfortunately, many public social media spaces are rife with bullying and offensive language, creating an unsafe environment for their users. In this paper, we present a new dataset for offensive language detection in Albanian. The dataset is composed of user-generated comments on Facebook and YouTube from the channels of selected Kosovo news platforms. It is annotated according to the three levels of the OLID annotation scheme. We also show results of a baseline system for offensive language classification based on a fine-tuned BERT model and compare it with the Danish DKhate dataset, which is similar in scope and size. In a transfer learning setting, we find that merging the Albanian and Danish training sets leads to improved performance for prediction on Danish, but not Albanian, on both offensive language recognition and distinguishing targeted and untargeted offence. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","Albanian; Kosovo; offensive language; social media","Social networking (online); Albanians; Facebook; Kosovo; Language detection; Media spaces; Offensive languages; Social media; Three-level; User-generated; YouTube; Classification (of information)","ITU","Bender, E.

We compare two ways to address these problems: one multi-class model that discriminates between all the classes at once: not misogynous, non aggressive-misogynous and aggressive-misogynous; as well as a cascaded approach where the binary classification is carried out separately (misogynous vs non-misogynous and aggressive vs non-aggressive) and then joined together. For the latter, two training and three testing scenarios are considered. Our models are built on top of AlBERTo and are evaluated on the framework of Evalita's 2020 shared task on automatic misogyny and aggressiveness identification in Italian tweets.

In the Natural Language Processing field, the state of the art concerning automatic document classification tasks relies on word and sentence embeddings built upon deep learning models based on transformers that have outperformed the competition in several tasks. However, the models built from these embeddings are usually difficult to interpret. On the contrary, linguistic features are easy to understand, they result in simpler models, and they usually achieve encouraging results. Moreover, both linguistic features and embeddings can be combined with different strategies which result in more reliable machine-learning models. The de facto tool for extracting linguistic features in Spanish is LIWC. However, this software does not consider specific linguistic phenomena of Spanish such as grammatical gender and lacks certain verb tenses. In order to solve these drawbacks, we have developed UMUTextStats, a linguistic extraction tool designed from scratch for Spanish. Furthermore, this tool has been validated to conduct different experiments in areas such as infodemiology, hate-speech detection, author profiling, authorship verification, humour or irony detection, among others. The results indicate that the combination of linguistic features and embeddings based on transformers are beneficial in automatic document classification. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","Feature Engineering; Linguistic Features; Natural Language Processing","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Embeddings; Extraction; Feature extraction; Information retrieval systems; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Document Classification; Domain knowledge; Embeddings; Feature engineerings; Features extraction; Language processing; Linguistic features; Machine learning models; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Domain Knowledge","","Almela, A., Valencia-García, R., Cantos, P., Seeing through deception: A computational approach to deceit detection in spanish written communication (2013) Linguistic Evidence in Security, Law and Intelligence, 1 (1), pp. 3-12; Barbieri, F., Ronzano, F., Saggion, H., Is this tweet satirical? a computational approach for satire detection in spanish (2015) Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural, (55), pp. 135-142; Barrio-Cantalejo, I., Simón-Lorda, P., Melguizo, M., Escalona, I., Marijuán, M., Hernando, P., Validation of the inflesz scale to evaluate readability of texts aimed at the patient (2008) Anales del sistema sanitario de Navarra, 31, pp. 135-152; Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Debora, N., Patti, V., Pardo, F.

Thus, a qualitative content analysis was performed on 316 visual and textual memes collected from various social media websites and online searches to assess salient categories related to choking during sex. We identified nine main categories: communication, gendered dynamics, choking as dangerous, choking as sexy, sexualization of the nonsexual, shame and worry, romance/rough sex juxtaposition, choking and religious references, instructional/informational. Given that memes, through their humor, can make difficult topics more palatable and minimize potential harm in the phenomenon they depict, more concerted, synergistic effort that integrates media literacy into sexuality education programming on the potential risks that may ensue for those engaging in sexual choking is warranted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Asphyxiation; Choking during sex; Manual strangulation; Meme analysis; Non-fatal strangulation",,,"Al-Natour, R., The digital racist fellowship behind the anti-Aboriginal internet memes (2021) Journal of Sociology, 57 (4), pp. 780-805; Al-Rawi, A., Siddiqi, M., Li, X., Vandan, N., Grepin, K., A thematic analysis of Instagram’s gendered memes on COVID-19 (2021) Journal of Visual Communication in Medicine; Andreasen, M.B., ‘Rapeable’ and ‘unrapeable’ women: The portrayal of sexual violence in Internet memes about #MeToo (2021) Journal of Gender Studies, 30 (1), pp. 102-113; Beres, M.A., Pearman-Beres, L.J., Johns, P., (2020) Youth healthy and safe relationships: A literature review (Working Paper)., , http://hdl.handle.net/10523/10531, University of Otago.

This issue becomes critical when the affected targets are minority groups such as women, the LGBT+ community and immigrants. Although from the perspective of computational linguistics, the detection of this kind of stereotypes is steadily improving, most stereotypes are expressed implicitly and identifying them automatically remains a challenge. One of the problems we found for tackling this issue is the lack of an operationalised definition of implicit stereotypes that would allow us to annotate consistently new corpora by characterising the different forms in which stereotypes appear. In this paper, we present thirteen criteria for annotating implicitness which were elaborated to facilitate the subjective task of identifying the presence of stereotypes. We also present NewsCom-Implicitness, a corpus of 1,911 sentences, of which 426 comprise explicit and implicit racial stereotypes. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the applicability of these criteria. The results indicate that different criteria obtain different inter-annotator agreement values and that there is a greater agreement when more criteria can be identified in one sentence. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","Annotation; Implicitness; Stereotype","Annotation; Implicitness; Minority groups; Social media; Stereotype","CSP; ","Allport, G., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Doubleday; Bach, K., (2010) Impliciture vs Explicature: What's the Difference?, pp. 126-137. , Palgrave Macmillan UK, London; Beukeboom, C.

Hence, many models suffer from the generalization problem. However, retrieving and monitoring hateful content on social media is a current necessity. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach using Graph Auto-Encoders (GAE), which allows us to avoid using labeled data when training the representation of the texts. Specifically, we represent texts as nodes of a graph, and use a transformer layer together with a convolutional layer to encode these nodes in a low-dimensional space. As a result, we obtain embeddings that can be decoded into a reconstruction of the original network. Our main idea is to learn a model with a set of texts without supervision, in order to generate embeddings for the nodes: nodes with the same label should be close in the embedding space, which, in turn, should allow us to distinguish among classes. We employ this strategy to detect hate speech in multi-domain and multilingual sets of texts, where our method shows competitive results on small datasets. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","Graph Auto-Encoders; Hate Speech Detection; Unsupervised Embeddings","Signal encoding; Speech recognition; 'current; Auto encoders; Embeddings; Generalisation; Graph auto-encoder; Hate speech detection; Multi-domains; Social media; Speech detection; Unsupervised embedding; Embeddings","CDTI; GVA; MICINN","Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep Learning for Hate Speech Detection in Tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760; Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Debora, N., Patti, V., Pardo, F.

It does, however, also provide a platform for online abusers to propagate abusive content. The majority of these abusive remarks are written in a multilingual style, which allows them to easily slip past internet inspection. This paper presents a system developed for the Shared Task on Abusive Comment Detection (Misogyny, Misandry, Homophobia, Transphobic, Xenophobia, CounterSpeech, Hope Speech) in Tamil DravidianLangTech@ACL 2022 to detect the abusive category of each comment. We approach the task with three methodologies - Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Transformer-based modeling, for two sets of data - Tamil and Tamil+English language dataset. The dataset used in our system can be accessed from the competition on CodaLab. For Machine Learning, eight algorithms were implemented, among which Random Forest gave the best result with Tamil+English dataset, with a weighted average F1-score of 0.78.

Investigating how they are portrayed on social media platforms that encourage humorous content, the article explores how this humorous discursive space frames sexual violence within a “just a joke” discourse. The portrayal of the three men reveals a discursive construction of sexual violence as “just sex” and puts the blame and the responsibility on the victims. Bringing together feminist theories of sexual violence with digital media methods, the article investigates the discourse unique to the Internet meme. The article demonstrates how certain notions about gender and sexuality are discursively reproduced in online spaces that privilege heterosexual men and exclude women and homosexual men. The article traces how sexual violence is characterized in different ways depending on who the men are: Weinstein as a monstrous other, Spacey as a perverted homosexual and pedophile, and C.K. as an antihero. © 2022 The Author(s).

Such occurrences can be linked to an abusive context, when they contribute to the expression of hatred and to the abusive effect, causing harm and offense. However, swearing is multifaceted and is often used in casual contexts, also with positive social functions. In this study, we explore the phenomenon of swearing in Twitter conversations, by automatically predicting the abusiveness of a swear word in a tweet as the main investigation perspective. We developed the Twitter English corpus SWAD (Swear Words Abusiveness Dataset), where abusive swearing is manually annotated at the word level. Our collection consists of 2577 instances in total from two phases of manual annotation. We developed models to automatically predict abusive swearing, to provide an intrinsic evaluation of SWAD and confirm the robustness of the resource. We model this prediction task as three different tasks, namely sequence labeling, text classification, and target-based swear word abusiveness prediction. We experimentally found that our intention to model the task similarly to aspect-based sentiment analysis leads to promising results. Subsequently, we employ the classifier to improve the prediction of abusive language in several standard benchmarks. The results of our experiments show that additional abusiveness feature of the swear words is able to improve the performance of abusive language detection models in several benchmark datasets. © 2022, The Author(s).","Abusive language detection; Content moderation; Hate speech detection; Social media; Swear words abusiveness",,,"Allan, K., Burridge, K., (2006) Forbidden words: Taboo and the censoring of language, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Self-disclosure and relationship strength in twitter conversations.

In this paper, we present a distinct way forward for research on low sexual desire in women partnered with men that attends to a more structural explanation: heteronormativity. A heteronormative worldview assumes that relationships and structures are heterosexual, gender (usually conflated with sex) is binary and complementary, and gender roles fit within narrow bounds including nurturant labor for women. We propose the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men, arguing that heteronormative gender inequities are contributing factors. We outline four hypotheses and their predictions related to: inequitable divisions of household labor, blurring of partner and mother roles, objectification of women, and gender norms surrounding sexual initiation. We discuss some mechanisms—social, physiological, and otherwise—for the heteronormativity theory, especially related to stress, objectification, and nurturance. We close by noting some limitations of our paper and the ways that the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men provides a rigorous, generative, and empirical way forward. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Femininity; Gender roles; Heteronormativity; Household labor; Nurturance; Sexual desire","adult; article; care behavior; female; femininity; heterosexuality; household; human; human experiment; male; physiological stress; prediction; sex role; family size; gender identity; libido; physiology; sexual behavior; sexuality; Family Characteristics; Female; Gender Identity; Heterosexuality; Humans; Libido; Male; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners",,"Adams, A.E., Haynes, S.N., Brayer, M.A., Cognitive distraction in female sexual arousal (1985) Psychophysiology, 22, pp. 689-696; Altinel, L., Kose, K.C., Ergan, V., Isik, C., Aksoy, Y., Ozdemir, A., Toprak, D., Dogan, N., The prevalence of low back pain and risk factors among adult population in Afyon region, Turkey (2008) Acta Orthopaedica et Traumatologica Turcica, 42, pp. 328-333. , PID: 19158453; Amaro, H., Raj, A., On the margin: Power and women’s HIV risk reduction strategies (2000) Sex Roles, 42, pp. 723-749; (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , 5, American Psychiatric Press; (2007), Anderson, S, Porn for women (Illustrated Edition).

Both calls were an amazing success, becoming world references for feminism. This research investigates how the strikes were dealt with through Twitter by a Collective Symbolic Coping (CSC) process. Discourses on Twitter were analysed on both years, 4,384 tweets were selected and their content was analysed by lexical analysis. The results from 2018 indicated the CSC phases of 1) awareness; 2) divergence, where feminist demands and the role of men in the strike were debated; and 3) convergence, where the success of the strike was highlighted. However, in 2019 the feminists on Twitter were forced to cope with a great deal of trolling against them. This trolling was maintained in the awareness and divergence phases, making it difficult to reach a convergent discourse regarding the success of the strike. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that there was no reference hashtag in the strikes. It is concluded that discourse on social networks has become a key factor in feminist social mobilizations and that this feminist digital activism will be critical in the continued dissemination of the claims for gender equality in Spain. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Collective symbolic coping; digital activism; feminism; social mobilization; social psychology; trolling; twitter","adult; article; awareness; clinical article; female; feminism; gender equity; human; human experiment; male; psychology; social network; Spain","","Araüna, N., Tortajada, I., Figueras-Maz, M., Feminist Reggaeton in Spain: Young Women Subverting Machismo Through ‘Perreo’ (2019) YOUNG, pp. 1-18; Baer, H., Redoing feminism: Digital activism, body politics and neoliberalism (2016) Feminist Media Studies, 16 (1), pp. 17-34; Barker-Plummer, B., Barker-Plummer, D., Twitter as a feminist resource: #YesAllWomen, digital platforms, and discursive social change (2017) Social movements and media, pp. 91-118. , Earl J., Rohlinger D., (eds), Bingley, UK: Emerald Publishing Limited, &,.

In addition, we examined the effect of having experienced sexual harassment on such perceptions. Analyses were performed on a Norwegian snowball social media sample covering 321 women and 168 men, aged 18–59 (M = 33.1). Outcome variables covered perceptions of scenarios that described opposite-sex social-sexual behaviors performed by female and male actors within the workplace environment. Path analysis showed that negative beliefs about the outcomes of the #MeToo movement was the principal predictor for perception of female and male social-sexual behavior as sexual harassment for women and men participants. Traditional values, gender equality, and hostile sexism toward women were all associated with perception of social-sexual behavior as sexual harassment, however the effects of these variables were only indirect and fully accounted for by the effect of negative #MeToo beliefs. For women, having experienced sexual harassment was associated with hostile sexism toward men, but had no effect on the perceptions over and above the effect of the other variables in the model. The predictors on participants’ perceptions were highly similar for women and men and for evaluations of female and male actors. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

Such texts cause adverse effects on users and society at large, therefore, the identification of toxic comments is a growing need of the day. While toxic comment classification has been studied for resource-rich languages like English, no work has been done for Roman Urdu despite being a widely used language on social media in South Asia. This paper addresses the challenge of Roman Urdu toxic comment detection by developing a first-ever large labeled corpus of toxic and non-toxic comments. The developed corpus, called RUT (Roman Urdu Toxic), contains over 72 thousand comments collected from popular social media platforms and has been labeled manually with a strong inter-annotator agreement. With this dataset, we train several classification models to detect Roman Urdu toxic comments, including classical machine learning models with the bag-of-words representation and some recent deep models based on word embeddings. Despite the success of the latter in classifying toxic comments in English, the absence of pre-trained word embeddings for Roman Urdu prompted to generate different word embeddings using Glove, Word2Vec and FastText techniques, and compare them with task-specific word embeddings learned inside the classification task. Finally, we propose an ensemble approach, reaching our best F1-score of 86.35%, setting the first-ever benchmark for toxic comment classification in Roman Urdu. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Deep ensemble; Deep learning; Roman Urdu; Roman Urdu toxic comments; Toxic comment classification",,,"Agrawal, S., Awekar, A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms (2018) Advances in Information Retrieval - 40Th European Conference on IR Research, ECIR 2018, pp. 141-153. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_11, Grenoble, France, March 26-29, 2018, Proceedings; van Aken, B., Risch, J., Krestel, R., Löser, A., .

Traditional accounts of institutions have often focused on formalized ones. It is argued here, however, that the principal idea behind one commonly accepted conception of institutions can be developed in a way that better facilitates an explication of informal institutions. When applied to the phenomenon of patriarchy, such an approach can then also allow us to ontologically make sense of gray areas and hierarchies of authority, as well as the intersectionality of social positions. © 2021 Johan Brännmark, published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","institutions; intersectionality; patriarchy; social ontology",,,"Ásta, (2018) Categories We Live By: The Construction of Sex, Gender, Race, and Other Social Categories, , New York Oxford University Press; Bicchieri, C., (2006) The Grammar of Society, , Cambridge Cambridge University Press; Bicchieri, C., (2017) Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms, , USA Oxford University Press; Brännmark, J., Institutions, Ideology, and Nonideal Social Ontology (2019) Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 49, pp. 137-159. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0048393118823265; Brännmark, J., Contested Institutional Facts (2019) Erkenntnis, 84, pp. 1047-1064. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-018-9994-7; Fricker, M., (2007) Epistemic Injustice, , Oxford Oxford University Press; Gilbert, M., (2018) Rights and Demands, , New York Oxford University Press; Greif, A., Kingston, C., Schofield, N., Caballero, G., , pp. 13-43. , Heidelberg Springer Verlag; Guala, F., Hindriks, F., A Unified Social Ontology (2015) Philosophical Quarterly, 65, pp. 177-201. , https://doi.org/10.1093/pq/pqu072; Hampton, J.A., Concepts as Prototypes (2006) Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 46, pp. 79-113. , https://doi.org/10.1016/s0079-7421(06)46003-5; Hartmann, H.I., The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union (1979) Capital & Class, 3, pp. 1-33. , https://doi.org/10.1177/030981687900800102; Hindriks, F., Norms that Make a Difference: Social Practices and Institutions (2019) Analyse & Kritik, 41, pp. 125-146. , https://doi.org/10.1515/auk-2019-410109; Hodgson, G.M., What Are Institutions?

The documents (Romanian old journals, articles, diaries and declarations, modernist literary texts from well-known Romanian authors such as Camil Petrescu, Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu, or Anton Holban) as well as the period of time analysed in this book are highly relevant to the way Romanian feminism has evolved over the years. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2022 All rights reserved.",,,,"Barbu, E., (1968) Groapa, , Ediţia a IV-a.

The methodology followed is based on three aspects: (a) a quantitative analysis using Sketch Engine to extract the main collocates from the corpus; (b) a sentiment analysis of the compiled tweets by means of two lexicon classifications: BING (Hu & Liu, 2004) and NRC (Mohammad & Turney, 2013), which classifies words into eight basic emotions and two sentiments (positive and negative); and (c) a qualitative analysis employing a Critical Discourse Analysis approach (Fairclough, 2013) to examine verbal abuse towards women from a linguistics perspective. © 2021 Universitat de Valencia, Faculty of Philology, Translation and Communication.

We propose a method based on logistic regression classifiers to probe English, French, and Arabic PTLMs and quantify the potentially harmful content that they convey with respect to a set of templates. The templates are prompted by a name of a social group followed by a cause-effect relation. We use PTLMs to predict masked tokens at the end of a sentence in order to examine how likely they enable toxicity towards specific communities. We shed the light on how such negative content can be triggered within unrelated and benign contexts based on evidence from a large-scale study, then we explain how to take advantage of our methodology to assess and mitigate the toxicity transmitted by PTLMs. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Cell proliferation; Computational linguistics; Cause-effect; Context-based; Language model; Large-scale studies; Logistic regression classifier; NLP systems; Social groups; Toxicity","NSFC; 研究資助局; ","Albadi, Nuha, Kurdi, Maram, Mishra, Shivakant, Are they our brothers? analysis and detection of religious hate speech in the arabic twitter-sphere (2018) Proceedings of ASONAM, pp. 69-76. , IEEE Computer Society; Aluru, Sai Saketh, Mathew, Binny, Saha, Punyajoy, Mukherjee, Animesh, Deep learning models for multilingual hate speech detection (2020) Proceedings of ECML/PKDD; Antoun, Wissam, Baly, Fady, Hajj, Hazem, Arabert: Transformer-based model for arabic language understanding (2020) LREC 2020 Workshop Language Resources and Evaluation Conference; Bender, Emily, Gebru, Timnit, Macmillan-Major, Angelina, Shmitchell, Shmargaret, On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?

The theme of this shared task is the detection of offensive content in social media. Among the known tasks related to offensive speech detection, this is the first task to detect offensive comments posted in social media comments in the Dravidian language. The task organizer team provided us with the code-mixing task data set mainly composed of three different languages: Malayalam, Kannada, and Tamil. The tasks on the code mixed data in these three different languages can be seen as three different comment/post-level classification tasks. The task on the Malayalam data set is a five-category classification task, and the Kannada and Tamil language data sets are two six-category classification tasks. Based on our analysis of the task description and task data set, we chose to use the multilingual BERT model to complete this task.

Automatic detection of misogynistic language online, while imperative, poses complicated challenges to both data gathering, data annotation, and bias mitigation, as this type of data is linguistically complex and diverse. This paper makes three contributions in this area: Firstly, we describe the detailed design of our iterative annotation process and codebook. Secondly, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of labels for annotating misogyny in natural written language, and finally, we introduce a high-quality dataset of annotated posts sampled from social media posts. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Automatic Detection; Codebooks; Data annotation; Data gathering; Detailed design; High quality; Social consequences; Social media","ITU; DFF","Ahn, Hwijeen, Sun, Jimin, Park, Chan Young, Seo, Jungyun, NLPDove at SemEval-2020 Task 12: Improving Offensive Language Detection with Cross-lingual Transfer (2020) Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 1576-1586; Kuwatly, Hala Al, Wich, Maximilian, Groh, Georg, Identifying and Measuring Annotator Bias Based on Annotators' Demographic Characteristics (2020) Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms, pp. 184-190. , Online.

The system was trained on English datasets and tested on a task of detecting hate speech and offensive social media content in a number of languages without any additional training. Experiments show an impressive ability of both models to generalize from English to other languages. There is however an expected gap in performance between the tested cross-lingual models and the monolingual models.

We provide a new dataset of ~40, 000 entries, generated and labelled by trained annotators over four rounds of dynamic data creation. It includes ~15, 000 challenging perturbations and each hateful entry has fine-grained labels for the type and target of hate. Hateful entries make up 54% of the dataset, which is substantially higher than comparable datasets. We show that model performance is substantially improved using this approach. Models trained on later rounds of data collection perform better on test sets and are harder for annotators to trick. They also have better performance on HATECHECK, a suite of functional tests for online hate detection. We provide the code, dataset and annotation guidelines for other researchers to use. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics; Data collection; Data creation; Detection models; Dynamic data; Fine grained; Loop process; Model in the loops; Modeling performance; Performance; Test sets; E-learning",,"Anzovino, Maria, Fersini, Elisabetta, Rosso, Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on Twitter (2018) NLDB, pp. 57-64; Basile, Valerio, Bosco, Cristina, Fersini, Elisabetta, Nozza, Debora, Patti, Viviana, Rangel Pardo, Francisco Manuel, Rosso, Paolo, Sanguinetti, Manuela, Sem Eval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech Against Immigrants and Women in Twitter (2019) Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63; Bender, Emily M., Friedman, Batya, Data statements for natural language processing: Toward mitigating system bias and enabling better science (2018) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6, pp. 587-604; Caselli, Tommaso, Basile, Valerio, Mitrovic, Jelena, Kartoziya, Inga, Granitzer, Michael, I Feel Offended, Don't Be Abusive!

They are commonly identified using classifiers solely based on textual content that generalize pre-agreed meanings of difficult problems. Such models provide the same results for each user, which leads to high misclassification rate observable especially for contentious, aggressive documents. Both document controversy and user nonconformity require new solutions. Therefore, we propose novel personalized approaches that respect individual beliefs expressed by either user conformity-based measures or various embeddings of their previous text annotations. We found that only a few annotations of most controversial documents are enough for all our personalization methods to significantly outperform classic, generalized solutions. The more controversial the content, the greater the gain.

Storm provided the play-by-play and Kremer was the analyst for a ‘Thursday Night Football’ livestream on Amazon Prime, which was simulcast alongside a Fox television broadcast with veteran announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. For viewers, the game represented seismic changes to a media landscape that had historically promoted aggression and a disruption to a sports ecosystem that routinely reinforces male-dominated gender norms. To better understand whether differences were advanced in the dialogues of the two broadcast teams, content analyses of the Amazon broadcast and the Fox broadcast were conducted. Attributes of athletic successes, failures, and physicality/personality were coded as verbal descriptors to allow comparison. A total of 777 descriptors showed significant differences in the frequency of the three classification areas, yet only one verbal descriptor difference was detected; the male team disproportionately elevated successes due to athletic ability. Results and the implications of these findings are discussed. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","football announcing; Framing theory; gender inequality; hegemonic masculinity; sports streaming","adult; article; content analysis; female; football; human; human experiment; male; masculinity; night",,"Adams, C., Ashton, M., Lupton, H., Pollack, H., Sport is king: An investigation into local media coverage of women’s sport in the UK East Midlands (2014) Journal of Gender Studies, 23 (4), pp. 422-439; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind, , Chandler Publications,.

This research investigates how this case has been dealt with through Twitter by a collective symbolic coping process (Social Representation Theory). Discourse on Twitter was analyzed at two key points in time: the announcement of the judgment and the aggressors’ release from prison. In total 6,592 tweets with the hashtag #lamanada were selected and their content was analyzed by lexical analysis using Iramuteq software. The results reveal both an awareness phase about the issue along with a divergence phase that saw the emergence of various interpretations about this case, which were confronted. In this divergence phase, feminist discourses took on great significance, expressing anger, calling for social mobilizations, criticizing the victim blaming and creating a dialogue against rape culture. However, the anti-feminist and sexist discourses were also present in this space. It is concluded that discourses on Twitter are a symptom of a shift in mentality whilst at the same time serve as an active constructor of this changed knowledge. Thus, the feminist movement should continue to take this into account in order to converge and normalize the discourse against rape culture. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Collective symbolic coping; digital activism; feminism; rape; rape culture; Twitter",,"","Alvarez, P., Juristas y expertas feministas critican la sentencia de La Manada: ‘Es una vergüenza’ (2018) El País, , https://elpais.com/politica/2018/04/26/actualidad/1524732623_919919.html, [Jurists and Feminist Experts Criticize La Manada’s Sentence: ‘It’s a Shame’.], April, 26; Alvarez, P., Lorente, J., Cata, J., Spanish Government Considers Legal Reform After Court Releases ‘Manada’ Sex-Attack Culprits (2018) El País, , https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/22/inenglish/1529650540_802576.html, June, 22; Amigot, P., Andino, S., El acontecimiento 8M: Politizar colectivamente el malestar (2018) Pikara magazine, , https://www.pikaramagazine.com/2018/04/8m_politizar_el_malestar/, [The 8M Event: Collectively Politicizing the Discomfort.], April, 6; Asenjo, I., ¡No es abuso, es violación!, indignación y solidaridad en las redes sociales (2018) La Rioja, , https://www.larioja.com/sociedad/manada-feminista-sanfermin-sentencia-redes-sociales-20180426105532-ntrc.html, [‘It’s Not Abuse, It’s Rape!’, Indignation and Solidarity Social Networks.], April, 28; Baer, H., Redoing Feminism: Digital Activism, Body Politics and Neoliberalism (2016) Feminist Media Studies, 16, pp. 17-34; Banet-Weiser, S., Miltner, K.M., #MasculinitySoFragile: Culture, Structure, and Networked Misogyny (2016) Feminist Media Studies, 16 (1), pp. 171-174; Barca, L.A., The Agency Factor: Neoliberal Configurations of Risk in News Discourse on the Steubenville, Ohio Rape Case (2018) Critical Discourse Studies, 15 (3), pp. 265-284; Berridge, S., Portwood-Stacer, L., Introduction: Feminism, Hashtags and Violence against Women and Girls (2015) Feminist Media Studies, 15 (2), pp. 341-344; Bodelon, E., La sentencia a ‘La Manada’ es terrible, usa eufemismos para referirse a la violencia y a la intimidación (2018) La Sexta, , https://www.lasexta.com/programas/al-rojo-vivo/entrevistas/encarna-bodelon-la-sentencia-a-la-manada-es-terrible-usa-eufemismos-para-referirse-a-la-violencia-y-a-la-intimidacion_201805015ae83e050cf288e92b71ad78.html; Burt, M.R., Cultural Myths and Support for Rape (1980) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 38, pp. 217-230; Castrillo, G., ForoCoches: el ‘bar’ de internet en el que se manda a la mujer a fregar (2018) El Mundo, , https://www.elmundo.es/papel/historias/2018/03/08/5a9fe4a8468aeb525c8b4570.html, March, 8; Ceberio, M., La Manada Ruling Sparks Fierce Debate over Definition of Sexual Violence (2018) El País, , https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/04/27/inenglish/1524824382_557525.html, April, 27; Dixon, K., Feminist Online Identity: Analyzing the Presence of Hashtag Feminism (2014) Journal of Arts and Humanities, 3 (7), p. 34; Dopazo, D., Miguel, N.S., Vivas, A., Carta de tres juezas a la joven agredida en San Fermín de 2016 (2018) Viento Sur, , https://vientosur.info/spip.php?article13782, May, 6; Durham, M.G., Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town: The Politics of Gender Violence in the New York Times’ Coverage of a Schoolgirl’s Gang Rape (2013) Journalism Studies, 14 (1), pp. 1-12; Duveen, G., Lloyd, B., (1990) Social Representations and the Development of Knowledge, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Edwards, K.M., Turchik, J.A., Dardis, C.M., Reynolds, N., Gidycz, C., Rape Myths: History, Individual and Institutional-level Presence, and Implications for Change (2011) Sex Roles, 65 (11-12), pp. 761-773; Franiuk, R., Seefelt, J.L., Cepress, S.L., Vandello, J.A., Prevalence and Effects of Rape Myths in Print Journalism: The Kobe Bryant Case (2008) Violence Against Women, 14 (3), pp. 287-309; Gilles, I., Bangerter, A., Clemence, A., Green, E., Krings, F., Mouton, A., Rigaud, D., Wagner-Egger, P., Collective Symbolic Coping with Disease Threat and Othering: A Case Study of Avian Influenza (2013) British Journal of Social Psychology, 52 (1), pp. 83-102; Ging, D., Alphas, Betas, and Incels: Theorizing the Masculinities of the Manosphere (2017) Men and Masculinities, , Epub Ahead of Print 10 May 2017; Golding, J.M., Lynch, K.R., Malik, S.E., Foster-Gimbel, O., Justice Served?

The book’s first part explores hate in personal relationships, looking for an answer to the question of why our personal relationships can survive hate and resentment but not disrespect or contempt. It shows that where contempt creates an irreparable power imbalance, hate is tied to fear, which our brains may reinterpret as thrill, attraction, and arousal. But this can also make hate a dangerous emotion that convinces people to hang on to abusive relationships. When tied to vengeance and the dark triad of personality, hate is not only dangerous but also dehumanizing. Vengeance and the dark personalities are not essential to hate, however. Without them, hate can have more admirable ends. The book’s second part explores the polarizing forces that can bias cohesive groups of like-minded individuals and contribute to what is effectively a hate crisis. Drawing on history, politics, legal theory, philosophy, and psychology, it shows how cultural myths about femininity, ethnic groups, and the land of opportunity perpetuate misogyny, racism, white supremacy, and anti-Semitism. But politicians and policymakers have it in their power to address the hate crisis through legislation that preserves the original incentive behind our constitutional rights. © Oxford University Press 2020.","Anti-Semitism; Banality of evil; Dehumanizing hatred; Group hate; Group polarization; Hate speech; Misogyny; Propaganda; Racism; White supremacy",,,"Abetz, J., Moore, J., Welcome to the Mommy Wars, Ladies: Making Sense of the Ideology of Combative Mothering in Mommy Blogs.” (2018) Communication Culture & Critique, 11, pp. 265-281; Abramson, K., A Sentimentalists Defense of Contempt, Shame, and Disdain.” (2009) The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Emotion, pp. 189-194. , P.

This paper presents the first French corpus annotated for sexism detection composed of about 12,000 tweets. In a context of offensive content mediation on social media now regulated by European laws, we think that it is important to be able to detect automatically not only sexist content but also to identify if a message with a sexist content is really sexist (i.e. addressed to a woman or describing a woman or women in general) or is a story of sexism experienced by a woman. This point is the novelty of our annotation scheme. We also propose some preliminary results for sexism detection obtained with a deep learning approach. Our experiments show encouraging results. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","Corpus; Sexism detection; Social media; Speech acts","Social networking (online); Annotation scheme; European laws; Learning approach; Social media; Social media networks; Deep learning",,"Austin, J.

To our knowledge, this is the first corpus of offensive language for Turkish. The corpus consists of randomly sampled micro-blog posts from Twitter. The annotation guidelines are based on a careful review of the annotation practices of recent efforts for other languages. The corpus contains 36 232 tweets sampled randomly from the Twitter stream during a period of 18 months between Apr 2018 to Sept 2019. We found approximately 19 % of the tweets in the data contain some type of offensive language, which is further subcategorized based on the target of the offense. We describe the annotation process, discuss some interesting aspects of the data, and present results of automatically classifying the corpus using state-of-the-art text classification methods. The classifiers achieve 77.3 % F1 score on identifying offensive tweets, 77.9 % F1 score on determining whether a given offensive document is targeted or not, and 53.0 % F1 score on classifying the targeted offensive documents into three subcategories. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","Cyberbullying; Hate speech; Offensive language; Text classification; Turkish","Classification (of information); Text processing; F1 scores; Micro-blog; Offensive languages; Social media; State of the art; Text classification methods; Turkishs; Social networking (online)",,"Agarwal, S., Sureka, A., Using KNN and SVM based one-class classifier for detecting online radicalization on Twitter (2015) International Conference on Distributed Computing and Internet Technology, pp. 431-442. , Springer; Agarwal, S., Sureka, A., (2017) Characterizing linguistic attributes for automatic classification of intent based racist/radicalized posts on Tumblr micro-blogging website, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.04931; Akgül, M., Kirlidog, M., Internet censorship in Turkey (2015) Internet Policy Review, 4 (2), pp. 1-22; Álvarez-Carmona, M.

Tackling hate speech in the standard way of content deletion or user suspension may be charged with censorship and overblocking. One alternate strategy, that has received little attention so far by the research community, is to actually oppose hate content with counter-narratives (i.e. informed textual responses). In this paper, we describe the creation of the first large-scale, multilingual, expert-based dataset of hate speech/counter-narrative pairs. This dataset has been built with the effort of more than 100 operators from three different NGOs that applied their training and expertise to the task. Together with the collected data we also provide additional annotations about expert demographics, hate and response type, and data augmentation through translation and paraphrasing. Finally, we provide initial experiments to assess the quality of our data. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Personnel training; Data augmentation; Research communities; Social media platforms; Large dataset",,"Ahluwalia, R., Shcherbinina, E., Callow, E., Nascimento, A., de Cock, M., Detecting misogynous tweets (2018) Proc.

The growing interest is confirmed by the large number of benchmark corpora for different languages developed in the latest years. However, abusive language behaviour is multifaceted and available datasets are featured by different topical focuses. This makes abusive language detection a domain-dependent task, and building a robust system to detect general abusive content a first challenge. Moreover, most resources are available for English, which makes detecting abusive language in low-resource languages a further challenge. We address both challenges by considering ten publicly available datasets across different domains and languages. A hybrid approach with deep learning and a multilingual lexicon to cross-domain and cross-lingual detection of abusive content is proposed and compared with other simpler models. We show that training a system on general abusive language datasets will produce a cross-domain robust system, which can be used to detect other more specific types of abusive content. We also found that using the domain-independent lexicon HurtLex is useful to transfer knowledge between domains and languages. In the cross-lingual experiment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our jointlearning model also in out-domain scenarios. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Dependent tasks; Different domains; Domain independents; Hybrid approach; Language detection; Low resource languages; Multilingual context; Multilingual lexicons; Deep learning",,"Basile, A., Rubagotti, C., Crotonemilano for AMI at evalita2018.

Faith schools constitute approximately one third of all state-maintained schools and two fifths of the independent schools in England. Nevertheless, they have historically been, and remain, controversial. In the current social climate, questions have been raised about the ability of faith schools to promote Community Cohesion and, included within that, their ability to promote tolerance. This book explores one aspect of the debate by examining the effect that faith schools have on their students' attitudes of tolerance. As well as asking what differences exist between students in faith and non-faith schools, it also looks at which aspects of the schools might be affecting the students and their attitudes towards different minorities. The book is a must-read for students and researchers in the fields of education and religious studies, as well as anyone with an interest in the place of faith schools in a modern multicultural society. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

It also traces pathways for knowledge-based choices to be made about directions for future long-term biological evolution and cultural development in view of adaptation to the expected, probable and possible future and the ecological sustainability of our planetary environment The authors discuss ethical challenges associated with the major biosocial sources of human variation: individual variation, inter-personal variation, inter-group variation, and inter-generational variation. This book approaches the long-term challenges of the human species in a holistic way. Researchers will find an extensive discussion of the key theoretical scientific aspects of the relationship between evolution and morality. Policy makers will find information that can help them better understand from where we are coming and inspire them to make choices and take actions in a longer-term perspective.

A consequence of this dissonance is an embodied performance of these ideals with the potential development of disordered eating practices, such as anorexia nervosa. This book develops a spirituality of anorexia by suggesting that these eating disorders are physical symptoms of the general repression of feminine nature in our culture. Furthermore, it puts forward Goddess feminism as a framework for a healing therapeutic model to address anorexia and more broadly, the –slender ideal— touted by society. The book focuses on the female body in contemporary society, specifically the development of anorexia nervosa, and what this expression communicates about female embodiment. Drawing upon the work of a variety of theorists, social commentators, liberation theologians and thealogians, it discusses the benefits of adopting female-focused myths, symbols and rituals, drawing upon the work of Marion Woodman and Naomi Goldenberg. Ultimately, it theorises a thealogical approach to anorexia aimed at displacing the damaging discourses that undermine women in the twenty-first century. Offering an alternative model of spirituality and embodiment for contemporary women, this book will be of keen interest to scholars of theology, religious studies, gender studies and psychology. © 2019 Emma White",,,,"Anam, T., Things your mother never told you (For fear you would demand a sex change) (2013) Fifty Shades of Feminism, pp. 17-23. , In: Appignanesi, L., Holmes, R., Orbach, S.

In the current study, men (N = 193), who completed questionnaires relevant to their conformity to masculine norms and level of hostile and benevolent sexism, were exposed to either misogynistic or neutral lyrics before having the opportunity to shock an ostensible female confederate in a bogus reaction time task that, in effect, measured aggression. Results indicated that misogynistic lyrics and hostile sexism significantly predicted both unprovoked and provoked aggression against a female target. Contrary to expectations, moderating effects of gender role beliefs on the relationship between misogynistic lyrics and men's aggression were not found. Implications are discussed in terms of the costs of misogyny in media for women's lives. Aggr.

Based on previous research, a classification of harmful workplace experiences affecting women is proposed and then used in the analysis of 88 studies with 93 independent samples, containing 73,877 working women. We compare the associations of different harmful workplace experiences and job stressors with women’s work attitudes and health. Random-effects meta-analysis and path analysis showed that more intense yet less frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention) and less intense but more frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexist organizational climate and gender harassment) had similar negative effects on women’s well-being. Harmful workplace experiences were independent from and as negative as job stressors in their impact on women’s occupational well-being. The power imbalance between the target and the perpetrator appeared as a potential factor to explain the type and impact of harmful workplace experiences affecting women’s occupational well-being. In the discussion, we identify several gaps in the literature, suggest directions for future research, and suggest organizational policy changes and interventions that could be effective at reducing the incidence of harmful workplace experiences.

Building on recent research, this book comprehensively revises such readings, setting out the complex and positive role played by the female in Aristotle’s thought with a particular focus on the longest surviving treatise on reproduction in the ancient corpus, the Generation of Animals. It provides new interpretations of the nature of Aristotle’s sexism, his theory of male and female interaction in generation, and his account of inherited features. It also discusses a range of more general issues which can and should be re-examined in light of Aristotle’s account of female animals: his methodology, hylomorphism, teleology and psychology. Aristotle on Female Animals will be valuable to all those interested in Aristotle’s philosophy and the history of gender. © Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge 2016.",,,,"Magnus, A., (1890) De Natura et Origine Animae, in Opera Omnia, , ed.

Unlike other studies, this book sees the robot in relation to Japanese popular culture, and argues that the Japanese ‘affinity’ for robots is the outcome of a complex loop of representation and social expectation in the context of Japan’s continuing struggle with modernity. Considering Japanese robot culture from the critical perspectives afforded by theatre and performance studies, this book is concerned with representations of robots and their inclusion in social and cultural contexts, which science and engineering studies do not address. The robot as a performing object generates meaning in staged events and situations that make sense for its Japanese observers and participants. This book examines how specific modes of encounter with robots in carefully constructed mises en scène can trigger reflexive, culturally specific, and often ideologically-inflected responses. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",,,,"Allison, A., (2006) Millennial monsters Japanese toys and the global imagination, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Aramata, H., (1996) Daitōa kagaku kitan [Mysterious science stories in Greater Asia], , Tokyo: Chikuma Shobō; Arjomand, M., Mosse, R., Editors’ preface (2014) The Routledge introduction to theatre and performance studies, , M.

The book brings together diverse critical methodologies derived from research carried out in ancient fields. It is divided into three sections that reflect distinct perspectives. This interdisciplinary approach challenges presumed associations of women and magic by probing the foundations and processes of, and motivations behind, gendered stereotypes, beginning with Western culture's earliest associations of women and magic in the Bible and Homer's Odyssey. The book interrogates gendered stereotypes that are as relevant now, for understanding contemporary popular culture, as for understanding antiquity or the early modern witch hunts.

I examine how underground rap music blurs the boundaries of restricted and large-scale production, as represented by noncommercial and commercial rap respectively. Artists identified as ""underground"" deploy anti-corporate, politically-charged, and socially-conscious lyrics, which can be viewed as restricted production. However, these lyrical themes are relatively scarce compared to themes of misogyny and hyper-masculinity found in this sub-genre and predominately found in commercial rap. This study thus reveals that large-scale and restricted fields of production may intersect (Craig and Dubois, 2010; Elafros, 2013; Hitters and van de Kamp, 2010; Sapiro, 2010). In this case, a symbiotic relationship may exist between major record companies and underground artists (Lena, 2006; Watkins, 2005; Watts, 2012) that demands further analysis. Rappers' habitus may inform and interact with rap music production, especially for ""second-go-round"" artists, compelling them to cooperate with commercial rap market imperatives (i.e., by using misogynistic and violent lyrics, as well as politically-oriented and socially-conscious rhymes) to maximize their appeal to both alternative rap consumers and large, mainstream record labels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Content analysis; Hegemonic masculinity; Mainstream rap music; Restricted production; Underground rap music",,,"Adams, T., Fuller, D., The words have changed but the ideology remains the same: misogynistic lyrics in rap music (2006) Journal of Black Studies, 36, pp. 938-957; Adorno, T., On popular music (1998) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, pp. 197-209. , Prentice Hall, New York, J.

The chapters in this book draw on insights from feminist and critical race theory to develop the idea that gender and race are positions within a structure of social relations. On this interpretation, the point of saying that gender and race are socially constructed is not to make a causal claim about the origins of our concepts of gender and race, or to take a stand in the nature/nurture debate, but to locate these categories within a realist social ontology. This is politically important, for by theorizing how gender and race fit within different structures of social relations we are better able to identify and combat forms of systematic injustice. The central chapters of the book offer critical social realist accounts of gender and race. These accounts function as case studies for a broader approach that draws upon notions of ideology, practice, and social structure developed through interdisciplinary engagement with research in social science. Ideology, on the proposed view, is a relatively stable set of shared dispositions to respond to the world, often in ways that also shape the world to evoke those very dispositions. This looping of our dispositions through the material world enables the social to appear natural. Additional chapters in the book situate a critical realist approach in relation to philosophical methodology, and to debates in analytic metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language. © Oxford University Press 2012.

An integral element within this development is the popular proliferation of imagery using the motifs of Bondage Domination Sadism and Masochism (BDSM). Fashion, advertising, music and the movies have all brought into the cultural mainstream a kind of aestheticised recoding of sex, in which the play of domination and submission take a key role. This would suggest, prima facie, that a previously marginalised and stigmatised form of sexual practice has been ‘rehabilitated’ and brought into the cultural mainstream. However, through an analysis of recent media imagery, it is argued that these popular representations risk blurring the normative boundaries between consensual BDSM ‘play’ and coercive violence/violation. For example, Vogue Italia’s controversial 2006 photospread entitled ‘State of Emergency’ combines ‘BDSM chic’ with post 9/11 signifiers of terror and torture, thereby potentially reinscribing BDSM as a socially and morally dangerous activity. Mainstream imagery therefore tends to consistently gloss over the centrality of consent in BDSM culture, thereby reinforcing negative stereotypes about the practices and their practitioners. Moreover, we hold that these media representations cannot be understood in isolation. Rather, they inter-connect in a relation of reciprocal influence with other discourses around ‘deviant’ sexuality, especially the medico-moral and legal discourses. Working together, they perpetuate a confusion of sexual consent and violence, which serves to fuel wider public anxieties about SM as ‘deviant’ and ‘perverted’, and supports moves to censor BDSM imagery, such as the recent prohibition on the possession of ‘extreme violent pornography’ introduced by the UK government. In the first part of this chapter, we consider the ways in which popular media has of late mobilised SM imagery, across diverse field including film, fashion photography, advertising and music. In the second part, we explore how these media representations intersect with medico-moral and legal discourses, and might thereby work in concert to reproduce the supposed ‘deviance’ (and, indeed, ‘criminality’) of BDSM practitioners. However, we also note the ways certain practitioners actively embrace the status and symbolism associated with deviance, as an integral element in the production of a desired social and sexual identity. © 2012 Athina Karatzogianni.",,,,"(2009) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders - Text Revision, , Absolutemadonna, The Sex Book 4th edn, 2000), Washington, D.C; Apel, D., Torture Culture: Lynching Photographs and the Images of Abu Ghraib (2005) Art Journal, 64 (2), pp. 88-100; Attwood, F., Reading Porn: The Paradigm Shift in Pornography Research (2002) Sexualities, 5 (1), pp. 91-105; Attwood, F., Other’ or ‘One of Us’?: The Porn User in Public Academic Discourse (2007) Particip@tions, 4 (1). , www.participations.org/Volume%204/Issue%201/4_01_attwood.htm, online at:; Barrett, J., You’ve Made Mistress Very, Very Angry’: Displeasure and Pleasure in Media Representations of BDSM (2007) Particip@tions, 4 (1). , www.participations.org/Volume%204/Issue%201/4_01_barrett.htm, online at:; (2006) Mother wins Ban On Violent Porn, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/5297600.stm, BBC News (30 August, Available at, (accessed 16 February 2011); Beckmann, A., Deconstructing Myths: The Social Construction of ‘Sadomasochism’ Versus ‘Subjugated Knowledges’ of Practitioners of Consensual ‘SM (2001) Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 8 (2), pp. 66-95; Beckmann, A., (2009) The Social Construction of Sexuality and Perversion: Deconstructing Sadomasochism, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Bibbings, L., Alldridge, P., Sexual Expression, Body Alteration and the Defence of Consent (1993) Journal of Law and Society, 20 (3), pp. 356-370; Brownmiller, S., (1975) Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape, , London: Secher & Walburg; Cross, P., Matheson, A., Understanding Sadomasochism: An Empirical Examination in Four Perspectives (2006) Sadomasochism:Powerful Pleasures, , in Kleinplatz, P. and Moser, C.
