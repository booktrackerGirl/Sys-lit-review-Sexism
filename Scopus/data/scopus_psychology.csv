This case provoked a great social reaction and became particularly viral on social networks such as Twitter. The present research investigates how this case has been dealt with through Twitter discourse. In particular, this study aimed to identify the main elements that could explain how people engaged with the problem of nonconsensual sharing of sexually explicit images in general, and with this case in particular. In total, 1,895 tweets with the word “Iveco” written in Spain were selected by streaming API, and their content was analyzed by lexical analysis using Iramuteq software (Reinert method). This software carries out an automatic lexical classification cluster analysis that groups the most significant words and text segments according to their co-occurrence. The results revealed that, on Twitter, it was stressed that the victim was a married woman with children who had practiced sexting. However, in response to this initial description, many voices also emerged that labelled this image-based abuse as gender-based online violence. Criticism was aimed at both the passivity of the company, and the attitude of hundreds of thousands of people who share the sexting video by WhatsApp groups without permission. Consequently, several feminist mobilizations emerged, framing this case within a sexist and patriarchal society and asking for accountability. However, in contrast, countermovements such as the #NotAllMen also emerged. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","image-based abuse; revenge porn; sexting; Twitter; violence against women","article; attitude; child; cluster analysis; female; feminism; gender; human; male; married woman; sexting; software; Spain; victim; videorecording; violence; voice; child abuse; sexual behavior; social media; Spain; text messaging; Child; Child Abuse; Female; Humans; Sexual Behavior; Social Media; Spain; Text Messaging","","Albury, K., Crawford, K., Sexting, consent and young people’s ethics: Beyond Megan’s story (2012) Continuum, 26 (3), pp. 463-473. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2012.665840, &; Angelides, S., ‘Technology, hormones, and stupidity’: The affective politics of teenage sexting (2013) Sexualities, 16 (5-6), pp. 665-689. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1363460713487289; Armstrong, C.L., Gao, F., Gender, Twitter and news content: An examination across platforms and coverage areas (2011) Journalism Studies, 12 (4), pp. 490-505. , &; Arrabal-Sanchez, G., De-Aguilera-Moyano, M., Communicating in 140 Characters.

Thus, a qualitative content analysis was performed on 316 visual and textual memes collected from various social media websites and online searches to assess salient categories related to choking during sex. We identified nine main categories: communication, gendered dynamics, choking as dangerous, choking as sexy, sexualization of the nonsexual, shame and worry, romance/rough sex juxtaposition, choking and religious references, instructional/informational. Given that memes, through their humor, can make difficult topics more palatable and minimize potential harm in the phenomenon they depict, more concerted, synergistic effort that integrates media literacy into sexuality education programming on the potential risks that may ensue for those engaging in sexual choking is warranted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Asphyxiation; Choking during sex; Manual strangulation; Meme analysis; Non-fatal strangulation",,,"Al-Natour, R., The digital racist fellowship behind the anti-Aboriginal internet memes (2021) Journal of Sociology, 57 (4), pp. 780-805; Al-Rawi, A., Siddiqi, M., Li, X., Vandan, N., Grepin, K., A thematic analysis of Instagram’s gendered memes on COVID-19 (2021) Journal of Visual Communication in Medicine; Andreasen, M.B., ‘Rapeable’ and ‘unrapeable’ women: The portrayal of sexual violence in Internet memes about #MeToo (2021) Journal of Gender Studies, 30 (1), pp. 102-113; Beres, M.A., Pearman-Beres, L.J., Johns, P., (2020) Youth healthy and safe relationships: A literature review (Working Paper)., , http://hdl.handle.net/10523/10531, University of Otago.

In addition to presenting established theories and models, this text encourages students to develop and apply general conclusions about persuasion in real-world settings. Along the way, students are introduced to the practice of social influence in an array of contexts (e.g., advertising, marketing, politics, interpersonal relationships, social media, groups) and across a variety of topics (e.g., credibility, personality, deception, motivational appeals, visual persuasion).

Trans young adults are especially vulnerable to these deleterious outcomes owing to their unique position in the life course. However, more research is needed on the mechanisms through which this marginalization contributes to mental health disparities in trans populations. Using a minority stress framework and online crosssectional survey design, the current study examines potential mediators of the relationship between transgender identity-related distal stress and psychological distress from late May to early July 2020 in a sample of transgender young adults (N = 239; ages 18–29). More than half the sample scored above the K6 cutoff for severe psychological distress. Distal stress had a significant direct (b =.17, SE =.04, t = 2.76, p =.006) and indirect effect on psychological distress. Distal stress was indirectly associated with psychological distress through gender dysphoria (b =.04; 95% CI [.001,.10]) and emotion dysregulation (b =.16; 95% CI [.09,.23]). COVID-19 pandemic stressors were also positively associated with psychological distress (b =.36, SE =.12, t = 5.95, p <.001). Results highlight the significant mental health burden facing the trans community especially in the COVID-19 context, support a conceptualization of gender dysphoria as connected to experiences of oppression, and affirm the relevance of emotion dysregulation within minority stress frameworks.

In this paper, we present a distinct way forward for research on low sexual desire in women partnered with men that attends to a more structural explanation: heteronormativity. A heteronormative worldview assumes that relationships and structures are heterosexual, gender (usually conflated with sex) is binary and complementary, and gender roles fit within narrow bounds including nurturant labor for women. We propose the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men, arguing that heteronormative gender inequities are contributing factors. We outline four hypotheses and their predictions related to: inequitable divisions of household labor, blurring of partner and mother roles, objectification of women, and gender norms surrounding sexual initiation. We discuss some mechanisms—social, physiological, and otherwise—for the heteronormativity theory, especially related to stress, objectification, and nurturance. We close by noting some limitations of our paper and the ways that the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men provides a rigorous, generative, and empirical way forward. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Femininity; Gender roles; Heteronormativity; Household labor; Nurturance; Sexual desire","adult; article; care behavior; female; femininity; heterosexuality; household; human; human experiment; male; physiological stress; prediction; sex role; family size; gender identity; libido; physiology; sexual behavior; sexuality; Family Characteristics; Female; Gender Identity; Heterosexuality; Humans; Libido; Male; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners",,"Adams, A.E., Haynes, S.N., Brayer, M.A., Cognitive distraction in female sexual arousal (1985) Psychophysiology, 22, pp. 689-696; Altinel, L., Kose, K.C., Ergan, V., Isik, C., Aksoy, Y., Ozdemir, A., Toprak, D., Dogan, N., The prevalence of low back pain and risk factors among adult population in Afyon region, Turkey (2008) Acta Orthopaedica et Traumatologica Turcica, 42, pp. 328-333. , PID: 19158453; Amaro, H., Raj, A., On the margin: Power and women’s HIV risk reduction strategies (2000) Sex Roles, 42, pp. 723-749; (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , 5, American Psychiatric Press; (2007), Anderson, S, Porn for women (Illustrated Edition).

In addition, we examined the effect of having experienced sexual harassment on such perceptions. Analyses were performed on a Norwegian snowball social media sample covering 321 women and 168 men, aged 18–59 (M = 33.1). Outcome variables covered perceptions of scenarios that described opposite-sex social-sexual behaviors performed by female and male actors within the workplace environment. Path analysis showed that negative beliefs about the outcomes of the #MeToo movement was the principal predictor for perception of female and male social-sexual behavior as sexual harassment for women and men participants. Traditional values, gender equality, and hostile sexism toward women were all associated with perception of social-sexual behavior as sexual harassment, however the effects of these variables were only indirect and fully accounted for by the effect of negative #MeToo beliefs. For women, having experienced sexual harassment was associated with hostile sexism toward men, but had no effect on the perceptions over and above the effect of the other variables in the model.

Traditional accounts of institutions have often focused on formalized ones. It is argued here, however, that the principal idea behind one commonly accepted conception of institutions can be developed in a way that better facilitates an explication of informal institutions. When applied to the phenomenon of patriarchy, such an approach can then also allow us to ontologically make sense of gray areas and hierarchies of authority, as well as the intersectionality of social positions. © 2021 Johan Brännmark, published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","institutions; intersectionality; patriarchy; social ontology",,,"Ásta, (2018) Categories We Live By: The Construction of Sex, Gender, Race, and Other Social Categories, , New York Oxford University Press; Bicchieri, C., (2006) The Grammar of Society, , Cambridge Cambridge University Press; Bicchieri, C., (2017) Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms, , USA Oxford University Press; Brännmark, J., Institutions, Ideology, and Nonideal Social Ontology (2019) Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 49, pp. 137-159. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0048393118823265; Brännmark, J., Contested Institutional Facts (2019) Erkenntnis, 84, pp. 1047-1064. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-018-9994-7; Fricker, M., (2007) Epistemic Injustice, , Oxford Oxford University Press; Gilbert, M., (2018) Rights and Demands, , New York Oxford University Press; Greif, A., Kingston, C., Schofield, N., Caballero, G., , pp. 13-43. , Heidelberg Springer Verlag; Guala, F., Hindriks, F., A Unified Social Ontology (2015) Philosophical Quarterly, 65, pp. 177-201. , https://doi.org/10.1093/pq/pqu072; Hampton, J.A., Concepts as Prototypes (2006) Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 46, pp. 79-113. , https://doi.org/10.1016/s0079-7421(06)46003-5; Hartmann, H.I., The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union (1979) Capital & Class, 3, pp. 1-33. , https://doi.org/10.1177/030981687900800102; Hindriks, F., Norms that Make a Difference: Social Practices and Institutions (2019) Analyse & Kritik, 41, pp. 125-146. , https://doi.org/10.1515/auk-2019-410109; Hodgson, G.M., What Are Institutions?

We examined the relationship between the frequency of misogynistic attitudes expressed on Twitter and incidents of domestic and family violence that were reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We tracked misogynistic tweets in more than 400 areas across 47 American states from 2013 to 2014. Correlation and regression analyses found that misogynistic tweets were related to domestic- and family-violence incidents in those areas. A cross-lagged model showed that misogynistic tweets positively predicted domestic and family violence 1 year later; however, this effect was small. Results were robust to several known predictors of domestic violence. Our findings identify geolocated online misogyny as co-occurring with domestic and family violence. Because the longitudinal relationship between misogynistic tweets and domestic and family violence was small and conducted at the societal level, more research with multilevel data might be useful in the prediction of future violence. © The Author(s) 2021.","aggression;

Victims must also show that they are recovering, as if domestic violence were a disease: They must transform from “victims” into “survivors.” Women's access to life-saving resources may even hinge on “good” performances of survivorhood. Through archival and ethnographic research, Paige L. Sweet reveals how trauma discourses and coerced therapy play central roles in women's lives as they navigate state programs for assistance. Sweet uses an intersectional lens to uncover how “resilience” and “survivorhood” can become coercive and exclusionary forces in women's lives. With nuance and compassion, The Politics of Surviving wrestles with questions about the gendered nature of the welfare state, the unintended consequences of feminist mobilizations for anti-violence programs, and the women who are left behind by the limited forms of citizenship we offer them. © 2021 by Paige Sweet.",,,,"Abramson, K., Turning up the Lights on Gaslighting (2014) Philosophical Perspectives, 28 (1), pp. 1-30; Abu-Lughod, L., Writing against Culture (2008) The Cultural Geography Reader, pp. 62-71. , Timothy S.

A total of 18,541 women were recruited from 61 research sites across 40 nations and completed measures of current-ideal breast size discrepancy, as well as measures of theorised antecedents (personality, Western and local media exposure, and proxies of socioeconomic status) and outcomes (weight and appearance dissatisfaction, breast awareness, and psychological well-being). In the total dataset, 47.5 % of women wanted larger breasts than they currently had, 23.2 % wanted smaller breasts, and 29.3 % were satisfied with their current breast size. There were significant cross-national differences in mean ideal breast size and absolute breast size dissatisfaction, but effect sizes were small (η2 = .02–.03). The results of multilevel modelling showed that greater Neuroticism, lower Conscientiousness, lower Western media exposure, greater local media exposure, lower financial security, and younger age were associated with greater breast size dissatisfaction across nations. In addition, greater absolute breast size dissatisfaction was associated with greater weight and appearance dissatisfaction, poorer breast awareness, and poorer psychological well-being across nations.

Featuring several contemporary real-world case studies, this book offers insight into the psychology of serial homicide offenders, mass shooters, school shooters and lone-actor terrorists. The main purpose of this book is not to glorify or condemn the actions of these individuals, but to attempt to explain the motivations and circumstances that inspire such acts of extreme violence. By adopting a detailed case study approach, it aims to increase our understanding of the specific motivations and psychological factors underlying extreme violence. Using nontechnical language, this book is the ideal companion for students, researchers, and forensic practitioners interested in the multidisciplinary nature of extreme violence. This book will also be of interest to students taking courses on homicide, mass shooting, school shooting, terrorism, forensic psychology and criminology and criminal justice. © 2020 Clare S.

It asks, what happens when those we approach for help cause further harm? Can we identify coercive practices and stop sexual abuse in psychology, psychiatry, and medicine? Tosh explores these questions and more to illustrate that many of the therapies considered fundamental to clinical practice are deeply problematic when issues of consent and sexual abuse are considered. The book examines a range of situations where medical power and authority produces a context where the refusals and non-consent of oppressed groups are denied, dismissed, or ignored, arguing that key concepts and discourses have resulted in the production and standardisation of a therapeutic rape culture in the helping professions. Tosh uses critical intersectionality theory and discourse analysis to expertly highlight the complex interrelationships between race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability in our understanding of abuse and how we define survivors. Drawing on a wide range of comprehensive examples, including experiences and perspectives from cisgender and transgender men and women, as well as nonbinary and intersex people, this is essential reading for students and researchers of critical and queer psychology, gender studies, as well as mental health practitioners and social workers. © 2020 Jemma Tosh.",,,,"Abourezk, K., (2017) Native American Psychologists Slam Police Tactics at Standing Rock, , www.indianz.com/News/2017/10/30/native-american-psychologists-slam-polic.asp; Acosta, F., Etiology and treatment of homosexuality: A review (1975) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 4 (1), pp. 9-29; Adams, G., Dobles, I., Gómez, L., Kurtis, T., Molina, L., Decolonising psychological science: Introduction to the special thematic section (2015) Journal of Social and Political Psychology, 3 (1), pp. 213-238; Affleck, W., Selvadurai, A., Sikora, L., Underrepresentation of men in gender based humanitarian and refugee trauma research: A scoping review (2018) Intervention, 16 (1), pp. 22-30; Ahrens, C., Being silenced: The impact of negative social reactions on the disclosure of rape (2006) American Journal of Community Psychology, 38 (3), pp. 263-274; Aiken, A., Padron, E., Broussard, K., Johnson, D., The impact of northern ireland’s abortion laws on women’s abortion decision-making and experiences (2019) BMJ Sexual Reproductive Health, 45, pp. 3-9; Akrich, M., Berg, M., Bodies on trial: Performances and politics in medicine and biology (2004) Body & Society, 12, pp. 1-12; Alderson, P., (1993) Children’s Consent to Surgery, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Alexander, T., (1997) The Medical Management of Intersexed Children: An Analogue for Childhood Sexual Abuse, , www.isna.org/articles/analog; Amado, B., Arce, R., Herraiz, A., Psychological injury in victims of child sexual abuse: A meta-analytic review (2015) Psychosocial Intervention, 24, pp. 49-62; (1973) Homosexuality and Sexual Orientation Disturbance: Proposed Change in DSM-II, 6Th Printing, Page 44, Position Statement, , Arlington: Author; (1980) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , (3rd ed.; DSM-III).

However, sexism as a form of discrimination towards women spread exponentially through the web and at a very high frequency, especially in the form of memes. Memes, which are typically composed of pictorial and textual components, can convey messages ranging from women stereotype, shaming, objectification to violence. In order to counterattack this phenomenon, in this paper we give a first insight in the field of automatic detection of sexist memes, by investigating both unimodal and multimodal approaches to understand the contribution of textual and visual cues. © 2019 IEEE.","Cybersexism; Early Fusion vs Late Fusion; Meme; Unimodal vs Multimodal","Computer programming; Computer science; Automatic Detection; Cybersexism; Late fusion; Meme; Multi-modal; Multi-modal approach; Very high frequency; Women stereotypes; Intelligent computing","","Khatua, A., Cambria, E., Khatua, A., Sounds of silence breakers: Exploring sexual violence on twitter (2018) IEEE ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), pp. 397-400; Ging, D., Siapera, E., Special issue on online misogyny (2018) Feminist Media Studies, 18 (4), pp. 515-524; Gasparini, F., Erba, I., Fersini, E., Corchs, S., Multimodal classification of sexist advertisements (2018) Proceedings of the 15th International Joint Conference on E-Business and Telecommunications; Glick, P., Fiske, S.T., The ambivalent sexism inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70 (3), p. 491; Bianco, S., Gasparini, F., Schettini, R., Adaptive skin classification using face and body detection (2015) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 24 (12), pp. 4756-4765; Anzovino, M., Fersini, E., Rosso, P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter (2018) NLDB, 2018; Tamura, H., Mori, S., Yamawaki, T., Textual features corresponding to visual perception (1978) Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 8 (6), pp. 460-473; Mack, M., Oliva, A., Computational estimation of visual complexity (2004) The 12th Annual Object, Perception, Attention, and Memory Conference; Schettini, R., Gasparini, F., Corchs, S., Marini, F., Capra, A., Castorina, A., Contrast image correction method (2010) Journal of Electronic Imaging, 19 (2), p. 023005; Ojala, T., Pietikainen, M., Harwood, D., A comparative study of texture measures with classification based on featured distributions (1996) Pattern Recognition, 29 (1), pp. 51-59; Junior, O.L., Delgado, D., Goncalves, V., Nunes, U., Trainable classifier-fusion schemes: An ap-plication to pedestrian detection (2009) Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2009.

The emergence of feminist campaigns such as #MeToo, #BeenRapedNeverReported, and Everyday Sexism are part of a growing trend of digital resistances and challenges to sexism, patriarchy, and other forms of oppression. Although recent scholarship has documented the ways digital spaces are often highly creative sites where the public can learn about and intervene in rape culture, little research has explored girls’ and women’s experiences of using digital platforms to challenge misogynistic practices. This is therefore the first book-length study to interrogate how girls and women negotiate rape culture through digital platforms, including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and mobile apps. Through an analysis of high-profile campaigns such as Hollaback!, Everyday Sexism, and the everyday activism of Twitter feminists, this book presents findings of over 800 pieces of digital content, and semi-structured interviews with 82 girls, women, and some men around the world, including organizers of various feminist campaigns and those who have contributed to them. As our study shows, digital feminist activism is far more complex and nuanced than one might initially expect, and a variety of digital platforms are used in a multitude of ways, for many purposes. Furthermore, although it may be technologically easy for many groups to engage in digital feminist activism, there remain emotional, mental, or practical barriers that create different experiences, and legitimate some feminist voices, perspectives, and experiences over others. © Oxford University Press 2019.

A consequence of this dissonance is an embodied performance of these ideals with the potential development of disordered eating practices, such as anorexia nervosa. This book develops a spirituality of anorexia by suggesting that these eating disorders are physical symptoms of the general repression of feminine nature in our culture. Furthermore, it puts forward Goddess feminism as a framework for a healing therapeutic model to address anorexia and more broadly, the –slender ideal— touted by society. The book focuses on the female body in contemporary society, specifically the development of anorexia nervosa, and what this expression communicates about female embodiment. Drawing upon the work of a variety of theorists, social commentators, liberation theologians and thealogians, it discusses the benefits of adopting female-focused myths, symbols and rituals, drawing upon the work of Marion Woodman and Naomi Goldenberg. Ultimately, it theorises a thealogical approach to anorexia aimed at displacing the damaging discourses that undermine women in the twenty-first century. Offering an alternative model of spirituality and embodiment for contemporary women, this book will be of keen interest to scholars of theology, religious studies, gender studies and psychology. © 2019 Emma White",,,,"Anam, T., Things your mother never told you (For fear you would demand a sex change) (2013) Fifty Shades of Feminism, pp. 17-23. , In: Appignanesi, L., Holmes, R., Orbach, S.

Based on previous research, a classification of harmful workplace experiences affecting women is proposed and then used in the analysis of 88 studies with 93 independent samples, containing 73,877 working women. We compare the associations of different harmful workplace experiences and job stressors with women’s work attitudes and health. Random-effects meta-analysis and path analysis showed that more intense yet less frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention) and less intense but more frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexist organizational climate and gender harassment) had similar negative effects on women’s well-being. Harmful workplace experiences were independent from and as negative as job stressors in their impact on women’s occupational well-being. The power imbalance between the target and the perpetrator appeared as a potential factor to explain the type and impact of harmful workplace experiences affecting women’s occupational well-being. In the discussion, we identify several gaps in the literature, suggest directions for future research, and suggest organizational policy changes and interventions that could be effective at reducing the incidence of harmful workplace experiences.

In particular, they have attracted criticism for policing the boundaries of ŉormal’ gender expression through gender identity diagnoses, such as transvestism, transsexualism, gender identity disorder and gender dysphoria. Drawing on discursive psychology, this book traces the historical development of psychiatric constructions of ŉormal’ and ‘abnormal’ gender expression. It contextualizes the recent reconstruction of gender in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and its criteria for gender dysphoria. This latest diagnosis illustrates the continued disagreement and debate within the profession surrounding gender identity as ‘disordered’. It also provides an opportunity to reflect on the conflicted history between feminist and transgender communities in the changing context of a more trans-positive feminism, and the implications of these diagnoses for these distinct but linked communities. Psychology and Gender Dysphoria examines debates and controversies surrounding psychiatric diagnoses and theories related to gender and gender nonconformity by exploring recent research, examples of collaborative perspectives, and existing feminist and trans texts. As such, the book is relevant for postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers of gender, feminism, and critical psychology as well as historical issues within psychiatry. © 2016 Jemma Tosh.",,,,"Ali, A., The intersection of racism and sexism in psychiatric diagnosis (2004) Bias in psychiatric diagnosis, pp. 71-76. , P.

We examined popular Halloween costumes (90 female costumes and 90 male costumes) from popular retail websites, 79 popular dolls and 71 popular action figures from national store websites, and Valentines found at two national stores (portraying 54 female and 59 male characters). The coding system was adapted from several different studies. Female characters were far more likely than male characters to be depicted with traditional feminine stereotyped cues (e.g., decorative clothing) and sexually submissive, hyper-feminine cues (e.g., revealing clothing). Male characters were far more likely to be portrayed with traditional masculine characteristics like functional clothing and the body-in-motion, and they were often depicted with hyper-masculine accessories such as having a weapon. Implications for children’s gender-role development and the perpetuation of patriarchy are discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Human sex differences; Popular culture; Socialization; Stereotyped attitudes",,,"Report of the APA Task Force on the sexualization of girls (2010) Retrieved from, , http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf; Anschutz, D.J., Engels, R.C.M.E., The effects of playing with thin dolls on body image and food intake in young girls (2010) Sex Roles, 63, pp. 621-630. , PID: 21212808; Aubrey, J.S., Harrison, K., The gender-role content of children’s favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions (2004) Media Psychology, 6, pp. 111-146; Auster, C.J., Mansbach, C.S., The gender marketing of toys: An analysis of color and type of toy on the Disney store website (2012) Sex Roles, 67, pp. 375-388; Baker, K., Raney, A.A., Equally super? gender-role stereotyping of superheroes in children’s animated programs (2007) Mass Communication and Society, 10, pp. 25-41; Blakemore, J.E.O., Centers, R.E., Characteristics of boys’ and girls’ toys (2005) Sex Roles, 53, pp. 619-633; Bussey, K., Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation (1999) Psychological Review, 106, pp. 676-713. , PID: 10560326; Bussey, K., Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of gender development and functioning (2004) The psychology of gender, pp. 92-119. , Eagly AH, Beall AE, Sternberg RJ, (eds), Guilford Press, New York; Calogero, R.M., Tantleff-Dunn, S., Thompson, J.K., (2011) Self-objectification in women: Causes, consequences, and counteractions, , American Psychological Association, Washington, DC; Cherney, I.D., Dempsey, J., Young children’s classification, stereotyping and play behavior for gender neutral and ambiguous toys (2010) Educational Psychology, 30, pp. 651-669; Cherney, I.D., London, K., Gender-linked differences in the toys, television shows, computer games, and outdoor activities of 5- to 13-year-old children (2006) Sex Roles, 54, pp. 717-726; Collins, R.L., Content analysis of gender roles in media: Where are we now and where should we go?

Jung Institute, Zürich, Switzerland; Frankfurt, Germany","Brodersen, E., C.G. Jung Institute, Zürich, Switzerland, Frankfurt, Germany","Instilled in interdisciplinary cross-cultural perspectives of mythical, socio-economic, literary, pedagogic and psychoanalytic representations, two archetypal, creative inheritance laws interact as 'twins': Eros (fusion/containment/safety) and Thanatos (division/separation/risk). Hypothesising these 'twin' laws as matrilineal (Eros) and patrilineal (Thanatos), this book explores why cross-cultural forms, including gender traits, are not fixed but are instead influenced by earlier flexible matrilineal forms. Through a study of 'twins' on macro and micro levels, Elizabeth Brodersen argues that a psychological 'twin' dilemma is implicit in inheritance laws and offers a unique forum to show how each law competes for primacy as the 'first' and 'other'. Chapters begin by looking at 'twins' in creation myths and the historical background to the laws of inheritance, as well as literary representations. The book then moves on to the developmental structures imbued in twin research and educational systems to explore how past cultural forms have been re-defined to fit a modern landscape and the subsequent movement away from the importance of patrilineal primogeniture. Laws of Inheritance will be of key value to academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, archetypal theory, cross-cultural depth psychology, cultural anthropology, sociology, gender studies and twin research. The book will also be of interest to practicing psychoanalysts and psychotherapists. © 2016 E. Brodersen.

A total of 327 British men completed scales measuring their drive for muscularity, sexist attitudes, hostility toward women, objectification of women, and key demographics. Results showed that greater drive for muscularity was significantly predicted by stronger objectification of women, hostility toward women, and sexist attitudes, once men's age and body mass index had been taken into account. These results suggest that oppressive beliefs held by men are associated with a desire for a more muscular physique. Implications for theoretical models seeking to explain drive for muscularity among men are discussed in conclusion © 2012 American Psychological Association.","Body image; Drive for muscularity; Objectification; Oppressive beliefs; Sexism",,,"Abrams, D., Viki, G.T., Masser, B., Bohner, G., Perceptions of stranger and acquaintance rape: The role of benevolent and hostile sexism in victim blame and rape proclivity (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, pp. 111-125. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.111; Agliata, D., Tantleff-Dunn, S., The impact of media exposure on males' body image (2004) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 23, pp. 7-22. , doi:10.1521/jscp.23.1.7.26988; Aubrey, J.S., Effects of sexually objectifying media on selfobjectification and body surveillance in undergraduates: Results of a 2-year panel study (2006) Journal of Communication, 56, pp. 366-386. , doi: 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00024.x; Bartky, S.L., Femininity and domination: Studies in the phenomenology of oppression (1990), New York, NY: Routledge; Blashill, A.J., Gender roles, eating pathology, and body dissatisfaction in men: A meta-analysis (2011) Body Image, 8, pp. 1-11. , doi:10.1016/ j.bodyim.2010.09.002; Bordo, S., Unbearable weight: Feminism, Western culture and the body (1993), Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Cafri, G., Strauss, J., Thompson, J.K., Male body image: Satisfaction and its relationship to well-being using the Somatomorphic Matrix (2002) International Journal of Men's Health, 1, pp. 215-231. , doi:10.3149/ jmh.0102.215; Cafri, G., Thompson, J.K., Measuring male body image: A review of the current methodology (2004) Psychology of Men and Masculinity, 5, pp. 18-29. , doi:10.1037/1524-9220.5.1.18; Cash, T.F., Body image: Past, present, and future (2004) Body Image, 1, pp. 1-5. , doi:10.1016/S1740-1445(03)00011-1; Chittester, N.I., Hausenblas, H.A., Correlates of drive for muscularity the role of anthropometric measures and psychological factors (2009) Journal of Health Psychology, 14, pp. 872-877. , doi:10.1177/ 1359105309340986; Cohane, G.H., Pope, H.G., Body image in boys: A review of the literature (2001) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 29, pp. 373-379. , doi: 10.1002/eat.1033; Connell, R.W., Masculinities (1995), Berkeley, CA: California University Press; Courtenay, W.H., Constructions of masculinity and their influence on men's well-being: A theory of gender and health (2000) Social Science and Medicine, 50, pp. 1385-1401. , doi:10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00390-1; Daniel, S., Bridges, S.K., The drive for muscularity in men: Media influences and objectification theory (2010) Body Image, 7, pp. 32-38. , doi:10.1016/j.bodyim.2009.08.003; Dworkin, A., Woman hating (1974), New York, NY: E.
