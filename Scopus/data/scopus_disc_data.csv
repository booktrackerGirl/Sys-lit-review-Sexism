Differentiating the concepts of ‘self-identification’ and ‘self-declaration,’ based on the idea of structural racism, we analyzed the possibility of invalidating racial self-declarations by those commissions. Based on anti-discrimination law, we will compare the accumulated experience of heteroidentification commissions in the racial context and the challenges that already arise in the implementation of affirmative action policies in the context of gender identity. We conclude that the result of the hetero-identification commissions does not invalidate racial self-identifications, but only racial self-declarations, being a form of social control of the public policy of affirmative action in higher education. © 2022, Centro de Estudos Educacao e Sociedade - CEDES.

This study examines predictors of group consciousness among Asians and Asian Americans in the United States, focusing on numerous dimensions of this concept, including linked fate, panethnic group identification, and four specific sources of perceived group commonality and interests: (1) cultural, (2) economic, (3) political, and (4) racial. We use data from a national survey to examine socio-structural, political, discrimination, and immigration correlates associated with separate dimensions of Asian group consciousness. We found that perceiving interpersonal discrimination increased the importance of being Asian; heightened the odds of feeling linked fate with other Asian people; and enhanced the odds of identification as “Asian American.” Republicans and Independents were less likely to perceive different elements of Asian group consciousness compared to Democrats. Educational attainment, income, gender, employment status, ethnicity, and English-speaking comfortability had varying effects across certain measures of Asian group consciousness. For Asians and Asian Americans, interpersonal discrimination and certain socio-structural, political, and immigration factors may be especially meaningful toward the development of linked fate, shared group interests and commonalities, and panethnic identification, all of which are key toward activating group consciousness. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","Asian Americans; discrimination; group consciousness; linked fate; panethnicity","","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","English","Sociol.

Given this, members of the community can face societal relegation across, not only race and gender lines, but across religious ones, too. This paper explores the lived experiences of intragroup discrimination, identity and belonging in 11 young Black Muslim Women in the United Kingdom. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants and thematically analysed through the lens of intersectionality. The use of an intersectional framework facilitated an understanding of the manner in which the sample was multiply marginalised. Two key themes emerged from the interviews: firstly, around experiences of intragroup and intersectional discrimination and, secondly, around the challenges of responding to and coping with the negative effects of such discrimination. Participants discussed the cross-cutting nature through which they faced discrimination: from within the Black community; from within the Muslim community; and as a result of their gender. The non-exclusivity of these three identities result in constant encounters of discrimination along different dimensions to their personal identity. They also developed diverse means of coping with this marginalisation including drawing from religious beliefs and mobile identifications, i.e. performing different aspects of their identities in different contexts. The present study contributes to existing knowledge in its focus on an under-researched group and emphasises the negative effects of intragroup discrimination. The paper importantly highlights the diversity within the Black community and considers the (in)visibility of Black Muslim Women within society. © The Author(s) 2021.","","belonging; Black Lives; coping; gender; identity; Intersectionality; intragroup discrimination; Islam","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","Ethnicities","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We develop three main hypotheses: that discrimination against women and Black job-seekers increases due to a reduction in labor demand; that discrimination against women decreases due to the reduced supply of women employees and applicants; and that discrimination against Black job-seekers decreases due to increased attention toward racial inequities associated with the Black Lives Matter protests during the summer of 2020. We test these hypotheses using a correspondence audit study collected over two periods, before and during the early COVID-19 pandemic, for one professional occupation: accountants. We find that White women experience a positive change in callbacks during the pandemic, being preferred over White men, and this change is concentrated in geographic areas that experienced relatively larger decreases in women's labor supply. Black women experience discrimination pre-pandemic but receive similar callbacks to White men during the pandemic. In contrast to both White and Black women, discrimination against Black men is persistent before and during the pandemic. Our findings are consistent with the prediction of gender-specific changes in labor supply being associated with gender-specific changes in hiring discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic. More broadly, our study shows how hiring decision-making is related to macro-level labor market processes. © The Author(s) 2022.","","COVID-19 pandemic; discrimination; gender; labor market outcomes; race; worker action; worker characteristics","","","Russell Sage Foundation, RSF; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (Award/P2C HD050924)","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Work Occup.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

For this reason, teeth play a momentous role in the forensic department to identify a missing or dead person. Gender discrimination is also a key process in forensic analysis. However, designing an automated dental gender estimation based on deep learning techniques still needs more research efforts. This paper proposed an algorithm to estimate the gender of a human from dental x-ray image (DXI). It consists of three steps namely pre-processing, segmentation, and gender classification. In the initial step, the DXI is denoised to remove the unwanted noises such as Gaussian, speckle, and impulse using a prime magic square filter. In the second step, the gradient-based recursive thresholding segmentation is used to segment the denoised DXI. At the final stage, the image is classified using the Resnet50 deep convolutional neural network classification algorithm. The database of 1000 dental images has taken and divided into 600 training samples and 400 testing samples during experimental evaluation. Various performance measures of the proposed segmentation and classification method are evaluated. The proposed system has achieved 98.27% of classification accuracy. Moreover, the performance of the proposed work is compared with similar existing methods. It shows that the proposed system produced better results. Therefore, the proposed gender classification system supports the dentist in forensic applications to record the dental post mortem details in case of a big disaster. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Classification (of information); Convolution; Digital forensics; Image classification; Image segmentation; Convolutional neural network; Dental X-ray image; Forensic analysis; Gender classification; Gender discrimination; Gender estimations; Human teeths; Key process; Learning techniques; Resnet50; adult; Article; classification; classification algorithm; controlled study; convolutional neural network; criminalistics; data accuracy; data analysis software; deep learning; evaluation study; female; human; human experiment; image processing; image segmentation; male; middle aged; noise reduction; prime magic square filter; residual neural network; sensitivity and specificity; sex determination; tooth radiography; Deep neural networks","Convolutional neural network; Dental x-ray image; Forensic analysis; Gender classification; Human teeth; Resnet50","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Biomed.

In order to clarify whether the protein composition of the perilymph can provide new insights into individual hearing performance after cochlear implantation (CI), computational analysis in correlation to clinical performance after CI were performed based on the proteome profile derived from perilymph samples (liquid biopsies). Perilymph samples from cochlear implant recipients have been analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The proteins were identified using the shot-gun proteomics method and quantified and analyzed using Max Quant, Perseus and IPA software. A total of 75 perilymph samples from 68 (adults and children) patients were included in the analysis. Speech perception data one year after implantation were available for 45 patients and these were used for subsequent analysis. According to their hearing performance, patients with excellent (n = 22) and poor (n = 14) performance one year after CI were identified and used for further analysis. The protein composition and statistically significant differences in the two groups were detected by relative quantification of the perilymph proteins. With this procedure, a selection of 287 proteins were identified in at least eight samples in both groups. In the perilymph of the patients with excellent and poor performance, five and six significantly elevated proteins were identified respectively. These proteins seem to be involved in different immunological processes in excellent and poor performer. Further analysis on the role of specific proteins as predictors for poor or excellent performance among CI recipients are mandatory. Combinatory analysis of molecular inner ear profiles and clinical performance data using bioinformatics analysis may open up new possibilities for patient stratification. The impact of such prediction algorithms on diagnosis and treatment needs to be established in further studies.  © 2022 Durisin et al.

Sexual minority men were generally reported to have more negative body image compared to heterosexual men, yet findings varied across body image constructs. In correlational work, body image was often examined in relation to disordered eating, mental health, internalization of appearance ideals, objectification, sexual behavior and relationships, gay community identification and discrimination, and health concerns (e.g., HIV, AIDS). Robust relationships emerged among body image and stigma variables, including internalized homophobia and harassment related to LGBTQ+ presentation and intersecting minority identities.

Using facial datasets balanced by race and gender, we examine three popular deepfake detectors and find large disparities in predictive performances across races, with up to 10.7% difference in error rate between subgroups. A closer look reveals that the widely used FaceForensics++ dataset is overwhelmingly composed of Caucasian subjects, with the majority being female Caucasians. Our investigation of the racial distribution of deepfakes reveals that the methods used to create deepfakes as positive training signals tend to produce “irregular” faces - when a person's face is swapped onto another person of a different race or gender. This causes detectors to learn spurious correlations between the foreground faces and fakeness. Moreover, when detectors are trained with the Blended Image (BI) dataset from Face X-Rays, we find that those detectors develop systematic discrimination towards certain racial subgroups, primarily female Asians. © 2021 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

In the last decades, many research works focused on classifying gender using the cues from 2D images of the person's frontal view. This limits their application in the real world. Also, classifying a person's gender from a different view, pose and scale are still challenging problems. RGB-D images, containing color and depth images, have more immunity to this problem than 2D images. Recent approaches using RGB-D images explored different combinations of features descriptors from depth and color images to classify the gender. These methods used low-level features extracted from the depth and color separately, ignoring the inter-dependency between the two modalities. In this article, we proposed a deep learning-based approach using a self-joint attention mechanism for human gender classification on RGB-D images. The proposed attention mechanism is designed to encode the inter-dependent information between the depth and color images to enhance the feature discrimination power.

Motivated by those results, software engineering researchers have proposed many methods for mitigating those discriminatory effects. While those methods are effective in mitigating bias, few of them can provide explanations on what is the root cause of bias. <bold>Objective</bold>: We aim to better detect and mitigate algorithmic discrimination in machine learning software problems. <bold>Method</bold>: Here we propose FairMask, a <italic>model-based</italic> extrapolation method that is capable of both mitigating bias and explaining the cause. In our FairMask approach, protected attributes are represented by models learned from the other independent variables (and these models offer extrapolations over the space between existing examples). We then use the extrapolation models to relabel protected attributes later seen in testing data or deployment time. Our approach aims to offset the biased predictions of the classification model by rebalancing the distribution of protected attributes. <bold>Results</bold>: The experiments of this paper show that, without compromising (original) model performance, FairMask can achieve significantly better group and individual fairness (as measured in different metrics) than benchmark methods. Moreover, compared to another instance-based rebalancing method, our model-based approach shows faster runtime and thus better scalability. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Algorithmic decision bias can be removed via extrapolation that corrects the misleading latent correlation between the protected attributes and other non-protected ones. As evidence for this, our proposed FairMask is not only performance-wise better (measured by fairness and performance metrics) than two state-of-the-art fairness algorithms. <bold>Reproduction Package</bold>: In order to better support open science, all scripts and data used in this study are available online at <uri>https://github.com/anonymous12138/biasmitigation</uri>.

At the same time, it has shown to exhibit bias, which can cause an unjust treatment of individuals and population groups. One method to achieve fairness in machine learning software is to provide individuals with the same degree of benefit, regardless of sensitive attributes (e.g., students receive the same grade, independent of their sex or race). However, there can be other attributes that one might want to discriminate against (e.g., students with homework should receive higher grades). We will call such attributes anti-protected attributes. When reducing the bias of machine learning software, one risks the loss of discriminatory behaviour of anti-protected attributes. To combat this, we use grid search to show that machine learning software can be debiased (e.g., reduce gender bias) while also improving the ability to discriminate against anti-protected attributes.  © 2021 IEEE.","Computer software; Machine learning; Decision making softwares; Discrimination; Gender bias; Grid search; High grades; Machine learning software; Machine-learning; Sensitive attribute; Software fairness; Decision making","Classification; Discrimination; Software fairness","","","European Research Council, ERC, (741278)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2021","176542","Virtual, Online","15 November 2021 through 19 November 2021","Amazon Web Services (AWS); Deakin University; et al.; Facebook; Huawei; NASA","English","Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

One cause for this is the encoded societal biases in the training data (e.g., under-representation of females in the tech workforce), which is aggravated in the presence of unbalanced class distributions (e.g., when “hired” is the minority class in a hiring application). State-of-the-art fairness-aware machine learning approaches focus on preserving the overall classification accuracy while mitigating discrimination. In the presence of class-imbalance, such methods may further aggravate the problem of discrimination by denying an already underrepresented group (e.g., females) the fundamental rights of equal social privileges (e.g., equal access to employment). To this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware boosting ensemble that changes the data distribution at each round, taking into account not only the class errors but also the fairness-related performance of the model defined cumulatively based on the partial ensemble. Except for the in-training boosting of the group discriminated over each round, AdaFair directly tackles imbalance during the post-training phase by optimizing the number of ensemble learners for balanced error performance. AdaFair can facilitate different parity-based fairness notions and mitigate effectively discriminatory outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","AI systems; Boosting; Class imbalance; Data driven; Disparate mistreatment; Ensemble learning; Equal opportunity; Fairness-aware classification; Statistical parity; Training data","Boosting; Class-imbalance; Disparate mistreatment; Ensemble learning; Equal opportunity; Fairness-aware classification; Statistical parity","","","Volkswagen Foundation","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","English","Knowl.

The violence occurs as a form of physical, sexual, psychological, economic or sociocultural abuse and aggression. VAW is mostly a covert, complex and undetected phenomenon, making effective interventions challenging. In many cases, VAW does not occur in isolation but is tangled in a web of violence, resulting in polyvictimisation. The intricate nature of VAW can be summarised according to a socioecological framework that divides contributing factors and interventions into individual, proximal and distal factors. From structural abuse, sociocultural disparity, economic inequality, gender-based discrimination, secondary victimisation and victim blaming to assertion of power and control by the perpetrator, all contribute to the lack of empowerment and self-agency of the survivor in escaping the cycle of violence. Managing VAW requires concerted and synergistic efforts from various stakeholders at every level of the socioecological system where mental health professionals are part of the team. It is essential to start with prevention, early detection and comprehensive treatment of VAW rather than merely diagnosing and prescribing medications in the area of women’s mental health. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","Handb. on Optimizing Patient Care in Psychiatry","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

First, the acoustic cues to the l-n distinction were examined in Fuzhou Min. Acoustic analyses suggested a collapse of phonemic contrast between prescriptive L and N (phonemes in the unmerged system), with none of the six acoustic cues showing any difference across L and N. Linear discriminant analysis did identify acoustically distinct [l] and [n] tokens, although the mapping onto the phonetic space of prescriptive L and N substantially overlapped. Speakers of all ages and both genders tended to produce [l], and low vowels correlated with more [n]-like classification. In perception, AX discrimination data showed Fuzhou Min listeners confused both prescriptive L and N and acoustic [l] and [n]. Greater sensitivity to the acoustic differences occurred in the context of low vowels and a nasal coda, supported by the acoustics of the stimuli, and younger listeners were more sensitive to the difference between [l] and [n] than older listeners. In two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) identification, Fuzhou Min listeners also identified the merged form as L more frequently than N, with more L responses elicited in the context of low vowels and in the absence of nasal codas. Overall, although Fuzhou Min speakers produced some acoustically distinct [l] and [n] tokens in the context of a sound merger, these productions did not map onto prescriptive L and N. In addition, younger listeners were more sensitive to the acoustic distinction than older listeners, suggesting an emerging acoustic contrast possibly arising due to contact with Mandarin. © The Author(s) 2022.","","lateral; Nasal; sound merger; speech perception; speech production","","","University of Kansas, KU","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","Lang.

A better understanding of how this process unfolds among young people with marginalized identities can help inform strategies to decrease mental health disparities and improve their overall health outcomes. A mixed method, convergent parallel design was used to examine identity centrality, mental health treatment history, and cultural experiences of a purposeful sample, consisting of 31 Black and Latinx young adults (Mage = 22.16) who identified as sexual and gender minorities in New York City. Data from validated measures and in-depth interviews were triangulated to strengthen and add context to findings.Participants with higher social identity centrality scores, particularly on community belonging and sexual identity, were more likely to continuously use mental health services. Seven social identities were prominent in qualitative data: Sexual, Ethnic–racial, Religious, Socioeconomic, Gender, Family, and Generational. These social identities were described as interconnected, and as both significant barriers and facilitators to participants’ involvement in treatment. Results suggested that young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) people of color seeking mental health care might need more support to navigate experiences related to intersecting identities. Interventions to improve services and maintain these youth in treatment should employ strategies to assess and support positive minority identity development, while also addressing self-stigma and discrimination experienced through culture, family, and mental health professionals. Considering social identity development is conceptually useful for adapting services for diverse youth because it is a major focus of transitioning to adulthood and calls attention to multiple minority identities impacting individual clients © 2021 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice","Adolescent; Adult; Female; Homosexuality, Female; Humans; Mental Health; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Identification; Social Stigma; Young Adult; adult; adulthood; article; attention; female; gender identity; Hispanic; human; intersectionality; interview; juvenile; LGBTQIA+ people; male; mental health care personnel; mental health service; New York; parallel design; social identity; stigma; young adult; adolescent; lesbianism; mental health; sexual and gender minority; social behavior; social stigma","Black; Latino; LGBTQ; mental health services; social identity","","","","American Psychological Association","","","","","","English","Am.

However, this category falls outside of most action plans to study and combat hate crimes.

The few authors who have targeted their studies to a single type of hate to improve accuracy, have focused on racism, xenophobia, or gender discrimination, but never on political ideology. Furthermore, the detection prototypes developed so far have not used databases generated manually by various coders.

Computer-based auditory training programs are under development for reducing the cost and time. The aim of this study is to develop a computer-based auditory training program and to evaluate the usability of the program by applying it to adults with normal hearing indifferent age groups and professions. The developed auditory training program consists of nine modules: identification, discrimination, recognition, auditory closure, comprehension, auditory sequencing, phonological awareness, auditory memory, and attention. Forty adults (age ranges of 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, and 55–65 years), nine audiologists, and one software engineer were included in this study. The computer-based auditory training program was applied to all individuals. An evaluation form was filled out by the participants to evaluate the usability of and satisfaction with the program, and the average performances of the individuals were calculated for each module. The form measures five usability subscales: ease of use, comprehensibility, design, satisfaction, and motivation. The professionals evaluated the program and found it to be quite positive in terms of design, ease of use, motivation, and comprehensibility, and positive in terms of the satisfaction subscale. The participants evaluated all factors and found them to be quite positive. There were no statistically significant differences between the gender, age, and computer use groups in terms of the average performance value of the modules (p > 0.05). However, a significant difference was found in the average performance for the auditory sequencing module considering the educational status of individuals (p = 0.019). Furthermore, it was determined that computer experience (> 5 years) and having a personal computer have a significant effect on auditory memory (p = 0.049) and identification (p = 0.027).

The feeling of inequality is the result of one stand‐alone characteristic or an intersection of many. To widen our knowledge of this diversity and to be able to design actions with an inclusive approach, we have set out to explore the relationship between students’ feelings of discrimination, their group identification and their intersections. Participants for the study are selected from protected groups which fall into the following criteria: ethnic minority, illness, migrant minority, disability, linguistic minority, sexual orientation, income, political ideology, gender, age and religion. We will refer to this relationship as the ‘discrimination rate.’ To fulfil our objective, we have given a questionnaire to a sample of 2,553 students from eight Spanish universi-ties. The results indicate that the characteristics with which they most identify are religion, age, sex and political ideology. However, the highest rate of discrimination is linked to linguistic minority, ideology and migration. Regarding intersection-ality, it is worth noting that 16.6% of students feel discriminated against for more than one characteristic, with the most frequent relationships being the following: (1) ethnic or migrant minorities (2) sexual orientation, sex, being under 30, leftist ideology, low income, linguistic minority and (3) Christian Catholic, right‐wing and upper‐class ideology. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)tion 4.0 International License (CC BY).","","Discrimination; Higher education; Inclusive education; Spain; University students","","","Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness; Spain?s Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness; State Research Agency; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (82862, EDU2017, EDU2017‐82862‐R)","Cogitatio Press","","","","","","English","Soc.

However, HIV-related stigma, especially among health workers, has been widely documented as a serious threat to this project. This study explored the factors associated with the stigmatization of people living with HIV among healthcare workers in Nigerian hospitals. Method: : Electronic literature search was conducted on eight databases using keywords and MeSH guidelines. Using the PRISMA protocol, studies published from 2003 to 2022 were retrieved and analyzed. Result: Of the 1481 articles identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. All the included studies were conducted across 10 of the 36 states in Nigeria, with every geo-political zone in Nigeria represented by at least two studies. The overarching themes identified were attitude and beliefs (n = 7), knowledge of HIV/AIDS (n = 3), quality of care (n = 4), education and in-service training (n = 4), and health facility policies and procedures (n = 3). Factors associated with HIV-related stigma among healthcare workers varied by gender, healthcare settings, specialties of health workers, and the presence of institutional stigma reinforcements. Healthcare workers without recent in-service training on HIV/AIDS and those who work in hospitals without anti-HIV/AIDS stigma policies exhibited more HIV-related stigmatizing attitudes. Conclusion: Continuous in-service training of healthcare workers and the development of comprehensive stigma reduction interventions that will be reinforced with anti-HIV stigma policies in clinical settings may facilitate the attainment of national HIV prevention goals. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","healthcare workers; HIV infection; Human immune-deficiency virus; social discrimination; social stigmatization","","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","English","J.

To ensure non-discrimination in learning tasks, knowledge of the sensitive attributes is essential, while, in practice, these attributes may not be available due to legal and ethical requirements. To address this challenge, this paper studies a model that protects the privacy of the individuals’ sensitive information while also allowing it to learn non-discriminatory predictors. The method relies on the notion of differential privacy and the use of Lagrangian duality to design neural networks that can accommodate fairness constraints while guaranteeing the privacy of sensitive attributes. The paper analyses the tension between accuracy, privacy, and fairness and the experimental evaluation illustrates the benefits of the proposed model on several prediction tasks.

In forensic investigation, reliability of the identification process is greatly affected by the visibility of the minutiae features. This is because the matching of known and unknown fingerprints achieved according to the types and locations of the minutiae features. However, most of the fingerprints recovered from the crime scene are of low quality, i.e. incomplete print or minutiae features. Under such circumstances, forensic analyst can try to determine gender of donor of the latent fingerprint. This piece of information could help to narrow down the scope of searching of suspect. Forensic discrimination of gender based on ridge counts has been proposed for a few decades ago. Despite multiple works have reported the use of machine learning methods in gender classification using fingerprints, the fingerprint features were mainly extracted from the images. In this work, the diagonal ridge counts were calculated manually within a well-defined region, i.e. 25 centimetres squared. This approach is more relevant to a real crime scene investigation. This work employed two well-known machine learning algorithms, i.e. naïve Bayes (NB) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithms, in discriminating gender based on the ridge counts. The performances of predictive models have been assessed by ethnicity and finger digit via bootstrapping without replacement approach. Results showed one-digit samples can perform as good as the five-digit or ten-digit samples. Comparing to the global predictive model, ethnicity-specific models of Indian and Malay subjects, respectively, showed better improvement. Moreover, by considering all five digits of a particular hand as input data, NB tended to outperform CART; whilst the relative performances reversed when only one digit was considered as input data. In conclusion, fingerprint ridge counts can be a potential indicator of gender in the Malaysian population.  © 2020 IEEE.","Barium compounds; Crime; Forensic science; Input output programs; Machine learning; Pattern matching; Predictive analytics; Classification and regression tree; Crime scene investigations; Forensic investigation; Gender classification; Gender discrimination; Identification process; Machine learning methods; Personal identification; Learning algorithms","Bayes naïve; CART; CART; fingerprint; fingerprint; gender; gender; Malaysian; MalaysianBayes naïve; ridge count; ridge count","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2020 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing and Technologies, 3ICT 2020","166447","Sakheer","20 December 2020 through 21 December 2020","","English","Int.

Therefore, it has been an open question which features allow reliable discrimination between male and female fundus images. To study this question, we used a particular DNN architecture called BagNet, which extracts local features from small image patches and then averages the class evidence across all patches. The BagNet performed on par with the more sophisticated Inception-v3 model, showing that the gender information can be read out from local features alone. BagNets also naturally provide saliency maps, which we used to highlight the most informative patches in fundus images. We found that most evidence was provided by patches from the optic disc and the macula, with patches from the optic disc providing mostly male and patches from the macula providing mostly female evidence. Although further research is needed to clarify the exact nature of this evidence, our results suggest that there are localized structural differences in fundus images between genders. Overall, we believe that BagNets may provide a compelling alternative to the standard DNN architectures also in other medical image analysis tasks, as they do not require post-hoc explainability methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Image classification; Medical imaging; Network architecture; Ophthalmology; Bag-of-feature model; Bag-of-Features; Feature models; Fundus image; Gender predictions; Interpretable deep neural network; Local feature; Neural network architecture; Optic disks; Retinal fundus images; Deep neural networks","Bag-of-features models; Gender prediction; Interpretable deep neural networks; Retinal fundus image","","","Faculty of Medicine, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, (463–0–0); International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems; Novartis; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (390727645, BE5601/4-2, EXC 2064); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01GQ1601, 01IS18039A)","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2021","265939","Virtual, Online","27 September 2021 through 1 October 2021","","English","Lect.

This study examined the influence of chemosensory and cognitive abilities on conscious odor sniffing behaviors in humans. Participants (N = 349) were surveyed using a questionnaire for the frequency of behaviors in terms of odor exploration from intrinsic and external sources. Chemosensory functions (e.g., odor identification, trigeminal sensitivity, taste functions, and nasal patency), self-reported olfactory function, and the subjective importance of olfaction were assessed. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrate a strong impact of olfactory importance on odor exploration behavior. Both female gender and chemosensory function (odor identification ability and trigeminal sensitivity) had a positive impact on odor exploration behavior from individuals' own body and from external sources. Moreover, participants with dysosmia compared to those with normosmia showed less frequent odor exploration behaviors, while their behaviors were partly predicted by nasal patency. In conclusion, conscious olfactory exploration behaviors reflect the interest in the sense of smell and is strongly modulated by chemosensory function. In turn, individuals with lower olfactory sensitivity invest less in olfactory explorations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Female; Humans; Nose; Odorants; Olfaction Disorders; Smell; Taste; menthol; fragrance; adult; Article; awareness; chemoreceptor; dysosmia; female; human; major clinical study; male; nasal patency; odor recognition test; olfactory discrimination; olfactory identification; peak expiratory flow; peak inspiratory flow; questionnaire; smelling; sweat gland disease; sweat gland function; taste; nose; odor; smelling disorder","Chemosensory function; Dysosmia; Important of olfaction; Odor exploration behavior; Questionnaire","","menthol, 1490-04-6, 89-78-1, 15356-70-4, 2216-51-5, 98167-53-4","Entrepreneurship and Innovation Support Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees, (cx2020114); European Commission, EC, (G2021168001L, HORIZON-EIC-2021-PATHFINDEROPEN-01 101046369); Technische Universität Dresden, TUD","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","English","Physiol.

We investigate how perceived stigma affects changes in group identification and whether this depends on other axes of advantage to which participants have access. We hypothesized that for Latinx undergraduate students, perceptions of stigma would predict increased ethnic identification but that access to other markers of advantage would dampen this effect. Methods:We measured ethnic identification, perceived stigma against one’s ethnic group, gender, income, and first-generation college status among Latinx undergraduates (N = 171). One year later, we assessed changes in ethnic identification using the same measure. Regression analyses assessed whether gender, income, and first-generation college status moderated the effect of perceived stigma on end-of-year ethnic identification, controlling for initial ethnic identification. Results: Controlling for initial ethnic identification, end-of-year ethnic identification was higher when participants perceived that their ethnic group was regarded negatively by others. However, this effect was only present among relatively low-income and first-generation college students. Conclusion: Intersectional perspectives are needed to understand how individuals manage stigmatized identities. Stigmatized individuals who face disadvantages in other areas may be more likely to depend on their devalued groups as a source of esteem and belonging. © 2021 American Psychological Association","Ethnic Groups; Humans; Social Identification; Social Stigma; Students; Universities; adult; article; college student; ethnic group; female; gender; human; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; perception; stigma; undergraduate student; social behavior; social stigma; student; university","Anti-Latinx stigma; ethnic identification; intersectionality; Latinx identity; perceived stigma","","","","American Psychological Association","","","","","","English","Cult.

Recent evidence suggests minority stress (e.g., discrimination) is associated with sleep disturbance in TGNB adults. However, investigators have yet to identify factors that might explain this relationship. In this study, we investigated the role of problematic drug use (PDU) in the relationship between discrimination and sleep disturbance in TGNB individuals. Methods: The study sample included 194 TGNB participants from Wave 5 (2021) of Project AFFIRM, a multi-site longitudinal study of transgender health. Discrimination, PDU, and sleep disturbance were measured using the Everyday Discrimination Scale, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), and PROMIS Sleep Disturbance measures, respectively. Individuals were classified as having PDU using established DUDIT criteria that were applied based on sex assigned at birth. Regression analyses were used to estimate the associations of study variables, and subsequently, mediation analysis was used to determine whether PDU partially mediated the association between discrimination and sleep disturbance. Results: Nearly half of participants reported PDU, of which 83.2% reported cannabis use. Higher levels of discrimination were associated with worse self-reported sleep disturbance scores. Additionally, participants with greater discrimination were more likely to have PDU. Surprisingly, participants with PDU had lower sleep disturbance scores. Conclusions: Our cross-sectional findings suggest that PDU partially suppressed the association between discrimination and sleep disturbance in TGNB people. Efforts to address PDU in TGNB adults may consider assessing sleep disturbance as a motivating factor for drug use and the potential role of discrimination in perpetuating PDU. © 2022","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; Substance-Related Disorders; Transgender Persons; central stimulant agent; cocaine; opiate; psychedelic agent; adult; aged; Article; attitude scale; behavior disorder assessment; cannabis use; cohort analysis; drug dependence; Drug Use Disorders Identification Test; Everyday Discrimination Scale; female; human; linear regression analysis; logistic regression analysis; longitudinal study; male; mediation analysis; PROMIS Sleep Disturbance; sleep disorder; sleep disorder assessment; social discrimination; transgender and gender nonbinary; cross-sectional study; drug dependence; newborn; sleep; sleep disorder; transgender","Discrimination; Minority stress; Nonbinary; Problematic drug use; Sleep disturbance; Transgender","","cocaine, 50-36-2, 53-21-4, 5937-29-1; opiate, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, (K23-AA028296); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (TL1-TR001875); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01-HD079603)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Addict.

Several handcrafted features are used for SER. However, determining these features is both a difficult and time-consuming process. Instead, the use of features generated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with spectrograms and Mel-spectrograms has gained momentum in recent years. These CNNs are widely employed in image applications. Therefore, the audio signals must be represented in the best way as images. The spectrogram presents evenly spaced frequency components. However, spectral energy when mostly at low frequencies is not desirable. The Mel-filter provides benefits, but several studies have shown that its performance is inferior to biologically inspired models. In addition, the high variance between features negatively affects its classification performance. In this study, log-power rate map features are suggested as an auditory model for the SER task. In addition, we have proposed the use of a threshold function to focus on regions with high spectral energy. A rate map provides better resolution in the low-frequency region. In addition, smoothing reduces the variance between features, and focusing on spectral peaks reduces the effect of user-dependent features. The proposed approach was tested, independent of subject and gender, on the EMO-DB and EMOVO datasets, which are widely used in the literature. In the EMO-DB dataset, an increase of 2.42 % was achieved, with a classification performance of 91.32 %. In the EMOVO dataset, an increase of 4.95 % was achieved, with a classification performance of 68.93 %. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biomimetics; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Spectrographs; Biologically inspired models; Classification performance; Frequency components; Human machine interaction; Low frequency regions; Map representations; Speech emotion recognition; Threshold functions; Article; auditory system; brain function; clinical feature; convolutional neural network; emotion; gender; human; mechanotransduction; priority journal; speech discrimination; Speech recognition","Convolutional neural network; Pseudo-coloration; Rate map; Speech emotion recognition","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Biomed.

Gender-based differences in mental health are well established. The objective of this study was to evaluate a new data mining technique to identify social locations of young Canadians where differences in mental health between adolescent males and females were most pronounced. Methods: We examined reports from 21,221 young Canadians aged 11–15 years (10,349 males, 10,872 females) who had responded to a 2018 national health and health behaviours survey. Using recursive partitioning for subgroup identification (SIDES), we identified social locations that were associated with the strongest differences between males and females for three reported mental health outcomes: positive psychosomatic health, symptoms of depression, and having a diagnosed mental illness. Results: The SIDES algorithm identified both established and new intersections of social factors that were associated with gender-based differences in mental health experiences, most favouring males. Discussion: This analysis represents a novel proof-of-concept to demonstrate the utility of a subgroup identification algorithm to reveal important differences in mental health experiences between adolescent males and females. The algorithm detected new social locations (i.e., where gender intersected with other characteristics) associated with poor mental health outcomes.

More than ever, the diagnostic approach process needs to focus on genetic and epigenetic alterations. The aim of our study was to identify and correlate the presence of COL9A1 gene variants in two types of samples from OSCC patients. Methods: Our pilot study included 32 subjects diagnosed with OSCC. Fresh tumour tissue and peripheral blood samples were used in order to identify the genotypes of the COL9A1 gene. Variables, such as age, gender and tobacco and alcohol use, were also taken into consideration. The DNA analysis of the samples was based on a tagged SNP (rs550675) for the allelic discrimination. Results: The statistical significance and correlation of the COL9A1 genotypes within the two categories of samples was statistically significant (p < 0.001) for the C/T and T/T genotypes, providing an important perspective on the potential identification in blood samples of the gene mutation encountered in OSCC. Conclusions: This is the first study that focused on providing preliminary results using blood samples via the identification of COL9A1 gene variants in OSCC patients. The possibility of introducing a liquid biomarker by targeting this genetic variant is an appealing perspective for screening and diagnosis. © 2021 by the authors.

We trained a machine learning model to predict future administrations of benzodiazepines on the basis of past data. We found that gender plays an unexpected role in the predictions—this constitutes bias. Using the AI Fairness 360 package, we implemented reweighing and discrimination-aware regularization as bias mitigation strategies, and we explored their implications for model performance.

Evidence has shown that job advertisements may express gender preferences, which may selectively attract potential job candidates to apply for a given post and thus reinforce gendered labor force composition and outcomes. Removing gender-explicit words from job advertisements does not fully solve the problem as certain implicit traits are more closely associated with men, such as ambitiousness, while others are more closely associated with women, such as considerateness. However, it is not always possible to find neutral alternatives for these traits, making it hard to search for candidates with desired characteristics without entailing gender discrimination. Existing algorithms mainly focus on the detection of the presence of gender biases in job advertisements without providing a solution to how the text should be (re)worded. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm that evaluates gender bias in the input text and provides guidance on how the text should be debiased by offering alternative wording that is closely related to the original input. Our proposed method promises broad application in the human resources process, ranging from the development of job advertisements to algorithm-assisted screening of job applications.

This is a form of identity denial and is linked to psychological distress. To test how foreigner objectification could be measured in Europe, we assessed whether the Foreigner Objectification Scale demonstrated reliability and validity with German adolescents. The sample included 806 9th graders from 17 high schools. The results showed that the scale demonstrates good reliability, scalar measurement invariance across gender and citizenship status, and partial scalar measurement invariance across family heritage, generational status, and cultural self-identification. Adolescents who scored higher on the scale also reported greater school behavioral disengagement, lower life satisfaction, and stronger ethnic identity. Our findings suggest that the scale is psychometrically sound and is linked in theoretically consistent ways to adjustment and ethnic identity. We conclude that this scale offers another way to capture subtle discrimination experiences that add to a more comprehensive understanding of discrimination and the related implications in Europe. © 2021 Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co.

In literature, studies treat posts independently and detect their emotions separately. Different from previous studies, we explore the dependence among relevant posts via authors’ backgrounds, since the authors with similar backgrounds, e.g., “gender”, “location”, tend to express similar emotions. However, personal attributes are not easy to obtain in most social media websites. Accordingly, we propose two approaches to determine personal attributes and capture personal attributes between different posts for emotion detection: the Joint Model with Personal Attention Mechanism (JPA) model is used to detect emotion and personal attributes jointly, and capture the attributes-aware words to connect similar people; the Neural Personal Discrimination (NPD) model is employed to determine the personal attributes from posts and connect the relevant posts with similar attributes for emotion detection. Experimental results show the usefulness of personal attributes in emotion detection, and the effectiveness of the proposed JPA and NPD approaches in capturing personal attributes over the state-of-the-art statistic and neural models. © 2022, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Product development; Adversarial networks; Attention mechanisms; Discrimination model; Emotion detection; Joint models; Literature studies; Personal attributes; Social media; Social media websites; State of the art; Social networking (online)","adversarial network; attention mechanism; emotion detection; personal attribute","","","","Springer","","","","","","English","J Comput Sci Technol","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The potential side-effects and fairness implications of such approaches are unknown, however. Using a large-scale bibliographic data set of N = 111,156 Computer Science researchers active from 1993 to 2016, I build and evaluate a realistic scientific impact prediction model. Given the persistent under-representation of women in Computer Science, the model is audited for disparate impact based on gender. Random forests and Gradient Boosting Machines are used to predict researchers’ h-index in 2010 from their bibliographic profiles in 2005. Based on model predictions, it is determined whether the researcher will become a high-performer with an h-index in the top-25% of the discipline-specific h-index distribution. The models predict the future h-index with an accuracy of R2= 0.875 and correctly classify 91.0% of researchers as high-performers and low-performers. Overall accuracy does not vary strongly across researcher gender. Nevertheless, there is indication of disparate impact against women. The models under-estimate the true h-index of female researchers more strongly than the h-index of male researchers. Further, women are 8.6% less likely to be predicted to become high-performers than men. In practice, hiring, tenure, and funding decisions that are based on model predictions risk to perpetuate the under-representation of women in Computer Science. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Discrimination; Gender; h-index; Impact prediction; Machine learning","","","University of Mannheim’s Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences; Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, AI2","Akademiai Kiado ZRt.","","","","","","English","Scientometrics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Hence, inves tigating with said population implies, in addition to actions to obtain relevant and truthful information, having the necessary actions to attend to their needs and peculiarities. These are populations that are difficult to access (hard-to-reach), stigmatized, in which there is no defined sampling frame, that have physical and mental health indicators lower than those of any other group with which we have worked and that, therefore, it is necessary to take extreme the precautions not to reproduce types of relationships that may be harmful or offensive. The purpose of the present article was to systematize part of our field experience with transgender people, so that it can be useful for those who study with this population. These recommendations aim to provide some conceptual, methodological and ethical guidelines, useful throughout the research process. In particular, we made a series of recommendations that cover from the moment of taking conceptual decisions about the design of the study, through contact with the organizations, until the completion of the field work and subsequent stage of dissemination of results. In particular, a series of recommendations are made regarding: specifying the definition of the group with which one works, recording the variety of gender identifications as people present them, using to sampling methods for hard-to-reach populations or hidden populations, deliver a retribution for the participation (consider participants as experts to be compensated for their work), including activists as experts in every stage of the study (study design, field work, data analysis and dissemination of results), piloting the instruments in specific population, preferably opt for group applications modality and continue with a debriefing, have specific assistance for participants during the application (special needs derived from their age, educational level, reduced mobility, among others), use non-stigmatizing and inclusive language, call together with trans organizations (in order to establish greater trust in the population), attend to a mobility of the population (so as not to replicate the sample in different places), carry out a committed listening and contemplate referral protocols (if necessary given the type of situations described by the participants and their current degree of elaboration), consider different trajectories of transition, conduct inter-analysis sessions and disseminate appropriately within the transgender population. These propositions are discussed in terms of their effects on trans communities, their usefulness and ethical scope, their articulation with the general requirements of all research, and their implications for activism. On the other hand, these recommendations can serve as criteria for evaluating the ethical dimension of research projects with trans people. It may therefore be important to project reviewers, editors, and reviewers of manuscripts submitted for publication. The perspective that we assume in this work is aligned with those called “evidence-based activism”, which implies articulating a variety of knowledge, scientifically accredited and of an “experiential” type, in order to explore situations in which the team members Research staff are part of networks that involve them personally in their study topics. It is precisely the relationship with groups that work for the rights of minorities, activists and members of these groups is essential, since they have knowledge acquired through their experience as part of discriminated groups and they can contribute to the mobilization of knowledge in the governance of health issues. © 2021.

It investigates predictions related to gender discrimination, which is a theme in the Brazilian legal system. In addition, it analyzes the role of collective bargaining in order to observe its usefulness to combat gender inequality in labor relations. The vicissitudes faced by trade unions are taken into consideration-especially professional ones-in the face of the opposition of the capital that has been strongly organized and empowered by its multidimensional intrinsic strength, besides globalization and neoliberal movements. Finally, the study examines the contributions of collective bargaining agreements for gender equality in labor relations that were in force during 2019, particularly within the following professional categories: teachers, in the State of Paraná, and bank employees and financiers, in Curitiba and Region. Methodology: This research uses the hypothetical-deductive approach and is also a bibliographic and documentary study. Results: The result shows that collective bargaining can be an effective instrument for the realization of gender equality in labor relations, providing expansion of rights, especially when it depends on the actions of combative unions, in particular, the Union of Teachers in the State of Paraná (SINPROPAR) and the Union of Employees in Banking and Financial Establishments in Curitiba and Region (SEEB). Contributions: This paper contributes to the discussion regarding gender equality in labor relations by critically analyzing collective bargaining agreements entered into by the Union of Teachers of the State of Paraná (SINPROPAR) and by Union of Employees in Banking and Financial Establishments in Curitiba and Region (SEEB) that establish clauses that seek to protect female workers belonging to their respective categories. © 2022, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

The world was immensely affected by the pandemic in 2020 through 2022, and our study attempts to use the data from this period to analyze the impact on anxiety and depression. First, we used the FP-growth algorithm for frequent pattern mining, which finds groups of items that frequently occur together, and utilized the resulting patterns and measures to determine which features were significant when inspecting anxiety and depression. Then, we trained a decision tree with the selected features to classify if a person has anxiety or depression. The resulting decision trees can be used to identify individuals at risk for these conditions. From our results, we also identified specific risk factors that helped predict whether an individual was likely to experience anxiety and/or depression, such as satisfaction with their sex life, cutting meals, and worries of healthcare discrimination due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.  © 2022 ACM.","Association rules; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Health risks; Anxiety; COVID; Dataset; Depression; FP growths; LGBTQ+; Mental health; Pattern mining; Pattern mining algorithms; Patterns classification; COVID-19","anxiety; association rules; classification; COVID; COVID-19; datasets; decision tree; depression; FP-growth; LGBTQ+; mental health; pattern mining","","","Gustavus Adolphus College","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","31st ACM Web Conference, WWW 2022","181993","Virtual, Online","25 April 2022","ACM SIGWEB","English","WWW - Companion Proc.

The rapid increase in university education and decrease in fertility rate in Iran over the past decades might affect the achievement of the SDGs. However, the country’s female labour force participation (FLFP) rate stagnates at a superficial level. The stagnating FLFP rate is inconsistent with basic labour economics supply-side explanations while drawing attention to demand-side explanations, namely, female labour demand constraints, such as occupational segregation and labour market discrimination. This study empirically investigates the effect on FLFP of primary labour supply factors along with household conditions and gender norms and attitudes for 2 specific years: 2008 and 2018. The aim is to shed light on the causes of stagnation at the FLFP level by using the Household Expenditure and Income Survey conducted annually by the Statistical Center of Iran. The empirical findings suggest gender norms and attitudes towards working women and gendered division of work associated with family care as the driving forces of stagnation in FLFP in Iran. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we aim to tackle the fairness-aware image classification problem, whose goal is to classify a target attribute (e.g., attractiveness) in a fair manner regarding protected attributes (e.g., gender, age, race). To this end, existing methods mainly rely on protected attribute labels for training, which are costly and sometimes unavailable for real-world scenarios. To alleviate the restriction and enlarge the scalability of fair models, we introduce a new framework where a fair classification model can be trained on datasets without protected attribute labels (i.e., target datasets) by exploiting knowledge from pre-built benchmarks (i.e., source datasets). Specifically, when training a target attribute encoder, we encourage its representations to be independent of the features from the pre-trained encoder on a source dataset. Moreover, we design a Group-wise Fair loss to minimize the gap in error rates between different protected attribute groups. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to train the fairness-aware image classification model on a target dataset without protected attribute annotations. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on CelebA and UTK datasets with two settings: the conventional and the transfer settings. In the both settings, our model shows the fairest results when compared to the existing methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification (of information); Computer vision; Signal encoding; Classification models; Computer vision system; Error rate; Real-world scenario; Transferable knowledge; Image classification","","","","Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program; Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; Yonsei University, (2020-0-01361); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2017M3C4A7069370); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT, (2019-0-01396)","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","15th Asian Conference on Computer Vision,  ACCV 2020","255949","Virtual, Online","30 November 2020 through 4 December 2020","","English","Lect.

This research established an accurate personalized predictive model of ASD behaviors among children by using the blood element detection index of children in Xinjiang, China. Methods: A total of 1537 children (240 ASD behavior children and 1297 non-ASD behavior children) aged 0–7 were collected from September 2018 to September 2019 in Urumqi Children's Hospital and the health management institute of Xinjiang Medical University. For measuring the copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd), 80 μL of blood was taken from each participant's ring finger. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to select predictors, then the multivariate logistic regression was used to establish the predictive model. The discriminability, calibration and clinical validity of the model were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Gender, concentrations of Pb, Ca and Zn in children's blood specimens were found to be the independent risk factors of ASD behaviors and were used to develop the nomogram model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) in the development group (AUC = 0.778) and the validation group (AUC = 0.775) showed the model had discrimination ability. The calibration curve indicated the model was accurate, and the DCA proved its clinical application value. Conclusion: The nomogram model can be used as a reliable tool to predict the risk of ASD behaviors among children. © 2022","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Cadmium; Calcium; Child; Copper; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Iron; Lead; Magnesium; Nomograms; Retrospective Studies; Zinc; cadmium; calcium; copper; iron; lead; magnesium; zinc; autism; child; cross-sectional study; human; nomogram; retrospective study","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Blood elements; Nomogram; Predictive model","","cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; magnesium, 7439-95-4; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Cadmium, ; Calcium, ; Copper, ; Iron, ; Lead, ; Magnesium, ; Zinc, ","Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang, (2017D01C225)","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","J.

Several cases are through the offline organization and the respective online platform. However, many victims share their experiences and stories on social media platforms. Twitter is one of the methods for locating and identifying gender-based violence based on its type. This paper proposed a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Network CNN with GloVe to perform multi-classification of gender violence. Intimate partner violence, harassment, rape, femicide, sex trafficking, forced marriage, forced abortion, and online violence against women are e eight gender violence keyword for data extraction from Twitter text data. Next is data cleaning to remove unnecessary information. Normalization converts data into a structure the machine can recognize as model input. The evaluation considers cross-entropy loss parameters, learning rate, an optimizer, and epochs. LSTM+GloVe vector embedding outperforms all other methods. CNN-LSTM+Glove and LSTM-CNN+GloVe achieved 0.98 for test accuracy, 0.95 for precision, 0.94 for recall, and 0.95 for the f1-score. The findings can help the public and relevant agencies differentiate and categorize different types of gender violence through text. With this effort, the government can use as one of the mechanisms that indirectly can support monitoring of the current situation of gender violence. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Yet little is known about who notices inequality in the world around them and when. Across five studies (N = 8,779) employing various paradigms, we consider the role of ideological beliefs about the desirability of social equality in shaping individuals' attention to-and accuracy in detecting-inequality across the class, gender, and racial domains. In Study 1, individuals higher (versus lower) on social egalitarianism were more likely to naturalistically remark on inequality when shown photographs of urban scenes. In Study 2, social egalitarians were more accurate at differentiating between equal versus unequal distributions of resources between men and women on a basic cognitive task. In Study 3, social egalitarians were faster to notice inequalityrelevant changes in images in a change detection paradigm indexing basic attentional processes. In Studies 4 and 5, we varied whether unequal treatment adversely affected groups at the top or bottom of society. In Study 4, social egalitarians were, on an incentivized task, more accurate at detecting inequality in speaking time in a panel discussion that disadvantaged women but not when inequality disadvantaged men. In Study 5, social egalitarians were more likely to naturalistically point out bias in a pattern detection hiring task when the employer was biased against minorities but not when majority group members faced equivalent bias. Our results reveal the nuances in how our ideological beliefs shape whether we accurately notice inequality, with implications for prospects for addressing it. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Although previous work has suggested a link between racial discrimination and PTSD symptoms, no studies have assessed this association in a sample of traumatic injury survivors. The current study investigated whether (a) past racial discrimination was associated with acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and (b) discrimination prospectively contributed to the prediction of future PTSD symptoms. African American and/or Black patients (N = 113) were recruited from an emergency department in southeastern Wisconsin. Patients in the acute postinjury phase (i.e., 2 weeks posttrauma) completed self-report measures, with PTSD symptoms assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale at 6-month follow-up. Bivariate associations indicated past racial discrimination was significantly related to acute PTSS. A multiple regression analysis revealed that pretrauma exposure to racial discrimination significantly predicted PTSD symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for age, gender, previous psychiatric diagnosis, social support, and lifetime trauma history. Our results suggest that experiences of racial discrimination add significant additional risk for PTSD symptom development following traumatic injury, R2 =.16, F(6, 106) = 3.25, p =.006. Broadly, these findings add to the body of empirical evidence and personal testimonies of Black individuals in White-centric societies asserting that racial discrimination affects mental health and overall well-being and further highlight the recent call for racism to be classified as a public health crisis. © 2021 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies","Adult; African Americans; Humans; Mental Health; Racism; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Survivors; United States; adult; African American; human; mental health; posttraumatic stress disorder; racism; survivor; United States","","","","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, FNIH, (#MH106574)","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","English","J.

They may motivate people to take safety precautions, but may hinder if they become too intense. Current research has examined mainly age and gender as potential correlates associated with worries. This study instead, is focused on self-perceptions of aging (SPA) and perceived age discrimination as potential predictors of worry, in the light of the ageism pandemic which has co-occurred with the COVID-19 outbreak. The study is based on a national sample of 1,092 adults aged 50 and above in Israel. Phone interviews were conducted between March 29 2020 and May 3 2020, when Israel gradually moved from strict to partial lockdown. Respondents were queried about their worries related to COVID-19 health consequences, demographic characteristics, known-risk factors, SPA and perceived age-based discrimination in the healthcare system. Our findings show that in addition, to sex, financial status and chronic illness, SPA and age-based discrimination in the healthcare were significant predictors of worries and explained additional 8% of the variance. The findings point to the potentially negative impact of the ageism pandemic in an area that has not received much attention, thus far, namely people's worries. Interventions that address ageism directed by self or others might alleviate worries in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Ayalon, Cohn-Schwartz.

Discrimination occurs when the probability of a positive outcome changes across privileged and unprivileged groups defined by the sensitive attributes. It has been shown that this bias can be originated from imbalanced data contexts where one of the classes contains a much smaller number of instances than the other classes. It is also important to identify the nature of the imbalanced data, including the characteristics of the minority classes' distribution. This paper presents FAWOS: a Fairness-Aware oversampling algorithm which aims to attenuate unfair treatment by handling sensitive attributes' imbalance. We categorize different types of datapoints according to their local neighbourhood with respect to the sensitive attributes, identifying which are more difficult to learn by the classifiers. In order to balance the dataset, FAWOS oversamples the training data by creating new synthetic datapoints using the different types of datapoints identified. We test the impact of FAWOS on different learning classifiers and analyze which can better handle sensitive attribute imbalance. Empirically, we observe that this algorithm can effectively increase the fairness results of the classifiers while not neglecting the classification performance.

The right to heritage is recognized as a human right falling under the right to culture or cultural identity. However, states are the primary bodies responsible for heritage identification and conservation, and may prefer to preserve the heritage of dominant social groups. Heritage identification and management by states, including the nomination of items for inclusion on the World Heritage List of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage and the Representative List of the Convention for Safeguarding the Intangible Cultural Heritage, thus has the potential to compromise the cultural rights of marginalized social groups, including women. Existing research and original research discussed herein reveal a dearth of heritage associated with women on both Lists. However, the problematic gender dynamics of this discourse goes beyond simple representativeness to encompass the ways in which women and their heritage are portrayed. The Representative List typically seeks to maintain existing social relations, including gender relations, with negative implications for women’s human rights set out in the UN Convention to Eliminate all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","cultural heritage; discrimination‌; Gender; human rights; intangible cultural heritage; UNESCO; women; world heritage","","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","English","Herit.

Yet gender identity has been invoked as a prohibited ground of discrimination, particularly in cases concerning trans persons.1 Trans existences fall outside the expectation of a correspondence between sex and gender. “Trans” is an umbrella term referring to people who do not identify with the sex attributed to them at birth. This broad definition encompasses pre-operative and postoperative transsexuals, as well as persons who have not undergone any medical intervention and do not conform to the social norms of expression and self-identification imposing the binary. Regional conventions do not define the concept of gender identity either. Documents issued by the United Nations (UN) and regional human rights bodies frequently rely on the category, without any clear explanation of the notion, or of what makes gender identity different from gender as such. Relying on Lacanian psychoanalysis, this essay argues that gender is an identity per se and challenges international law’s treatment of gender and gender identity as distinct categories. Underlying this essay is the view that questioning the shape that the law gives to “gender identity” is the preliminary step to evaluating what protections human rights law can or cannot offer to individuals. © Giovanna Gilleri 2022.

In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving training algorithm for a fair support vector machine classifier based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE), where the privacy of both sensitive information and model secrecy can be preserved. The expensive computational costs of HE can be significantly improved by protecting only the sensitive information, introducing refined formulation and low-rank approximation using shared eigenvectors. Through experiments on the synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of accuracy and fairness and show that our method significantly outperforms other privacy-preserving solutions in terms of better trade-offs between accuracy and fairness. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first privacy-preserving fair learning algorithm using HE. © 2022 ACM.","Classification (of information); Decision making; Economic and social effects; Learning algorithms; Privacy-preserving techniques; Automated decision making systems; Fair learning; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Machine learning models; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving machine learning; Sensitive attribute; Sensitive informations; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","fair learning; homomorphic encryption; privacy-preserving machine learning; support vector machine","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62121002)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","31st ACM World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2022","178956","Virtual, Online","25 April 2022 through 29 April 2022","ACM SIGWEB","English","WWW - Proc.

Based on the literature review, two hypotheses of the study were formed, reflecting the factors of wage changes with respect to age. The first hypothesis is that the wages of older workers are determined by age discrimination. According to the second hypothesis, the wages of older workers depend on their accumulated human capital (education, skills, and health). To test the two hypotheses of the study we carry out a multidimensional statistical analysis. It included the construction of regression models, performing discriminant analysis, and testing statistical hypotheses of data uniformity. We use the data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of HSE (RLMS-HSE) covering the years from 2000 to 2019. The data from the monitoring survey have been analyzed not only with respect to age, but gender as well. The results of the study confirmed the first hypothesis for men of pre-retirement and retirement age, as well as women of retirement age. The second hypothesis that the depreciation of human capital with age affects the remuneration of older workers has been partially confirmed. For the older generation of both sexes, a significant factor of wages is health, for men it is also the presence of a completed professional education. Continual education has a positive effect on average earnings, but only for women. Computer skills increases all workers’ wages except men older than 60. We did not find out any significant effect of human capital accumulation on wages for workers of pre-retirement and retirement age. © 2021 Scientia Sinica Chimica.

However, there is a certain level of tolerance (a share of 36%) when it comes to so-called governments’ rights to monitor electronic mail messages and other information exchange as resulting from the answers of respondents from 51 countries in the latest wave (2017– 2020) of the World Values Survey. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to discover the most significant influences associated with this type of tolerance and even causal relationships. The variables have been selected and analyzed in many rounds (Adaptive Boosting, LASSO, mixed-effects modeling, and different regressions) with the aid of a private cloud. The results confirmed most hypotheses regarding the overwhelming role of trust, public surveillance acceptance, and some attitudes indicating conscientiousness, altruistic behavior, and gender discrimination acceptance in models with good-to-excellent classification accuracy. A generated prediction nomogram included 10 ten most resilient influences. Another one contained only 5 of these 10 that acted more as determinants resisting reverse causality checks. In addition, some sociodemographic controls indicated significant variables afferent to the highest education level attained, settlement size, and marital status.

The vital detection of this research unveils that while women-owned firms face certain constraints like their men counterparts, there are many challenges that women solely face because of their gender. Risk aversion of banks, lack of financial services, lack of collateral, and low accessibility to finance are some of the specific constraints faced by women-owned businesses. Our results imply that women-owned firms have more often been credit worthy than the men-owned firms in terms of financial penetrability and debarment from the financial markets.

Gender determination is an important preliminary step in the identification of unknown skeletal remains. This study aimed at determining the dimensions of the foramen magnum in Delta State Nigeria and their role in gender discrimination. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed computed tomographic images of 336 patients (199 males and 137 females) aged ≥18 years, archived in the Radiology Department of a Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. Ethical approval was granted by the hospital's ethical board. The length, width, and area of the foramen magnum were measured and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 23. We used an independent t-test and analysis of variance to evaluate the association of these dimensions with sex and age, respectively. The percentage accuracy of sex discrimination and the association between variables were assessed using discriminant functional analysis and Pearson's correlation test correspondingly. The results were considered significant at P < 0.05. Results: The foramen magnum length, width, and area showed a statistically significant gender difference (P < 0.05). The width was the best sex discriminating variable (64.3%) and the overall accuracy of correct sex allocation using all the variables was 75%. All the parameters measured showed a significant strong positive correlation with each other (0.5 ≤ r < 1, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The foramen magnum length width and area were sexually dimorphic. Their high overall accuracy (75%) in gender discrimination implies that they may collectively be utilized in the sex estimation of unknown skulls in Delta State Nigeria.  © 2022 Journal of Forensic Science and Medicine.","","Foramen magnum; forensic science; length; width","","","","Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications","","","","","","English","J.Foren.

Recent methods have been explored to alleviate the discrimination between certain demographic groups that are characterized by sensitive attributes (such as race, age, or gender). Some studies have found that the data itself is biased, so training directly on the data causes unfair decision making. Models directly trained on raw data can replicate or even exacerbate bias in the prediction between demographic groups. This leads to vastly different prediction performance in different demographic groups. In order to address this issue, we propose a new approach to improve machine learning fairness by generating fair data. We introduce a generative model to generate cross-domain samples w.r.t. multiple sensitive attributes. This ensures that we can generate infinite number of samples that are balanced w.r.t. both target label and sensitive attributes to enhance fair prediction. By training the classifier solely with the synthetic data and then transfer the model to real data, we can overcome the under-representation problem which is non-trivial since collecting real data is extremely time and resource consuming. We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the benefit of our model with respect to both fairness and accuracy.

We extend this literature by proposing that motherhood is not a necessary condition for women to face motherhood penalties. Instead, managers' expectations that an applicant will have a child in the near future (i.e., “maybe baby” expectations) increases their perceptions of risk associated with employing childfree, childbearing-aged women—but not men. Investigating the intersection of gender and age, and integrating economic theories of discrimination, we conceptualize hiring as a risk assessment process, proposing that managers' risk perceptions drive more precarious employment conditions for this group of women. Results from a field study with early career employees (Study 1) and a randomized experiment with hiring managers (Study 2) support our predictions across attitudinal (e.g., desire to offer a temporary job contract; Study 2) and objective indicators (e.g., having a temporary job contract; Study 1); female applicants can also mitigate this “maybe baby” risk by signaling a lack of interest in having children or by emphasizing their commitment and work ethic (Study 2). Our findings suggest that the perceived risks of parenthood can be hazardous for child-bearing-aged, childfree working women who simply may become parents (vs. men and mothers; vs. childfree women who are significantly younger or older than the average age of the first childbearing in the local context). © 2021 The Authors.

Specifically, it is interested in the identification of the argumentative resources that inform lay constructions of LGBTQI+ claims and rights, as well as of their potential social implications. The research data are drawn from seven focus groups, conducted in Thessaloniki, Greece and analysed by the conceptual tools of Critical Discursive Social Psychology. According to the analysis, liberal dilemmas over difference, visibility, and equality are mobilized. In particular, when accounting for violence and discriminations against LGBTQI+ community members, participants construct a normative hierarchy of exclusion, based on alleged differences between sexual and gender-related categories. Notably, in the context of arguing over different claim-making practices, participants prioritize the projection of uniformity – instead of difference – through non-provocative, consensual claiming actions. While liberal concepts and subsequent dilemmas inform these constructions, “liberalism” is also represented as the rhetorical other, when participants prioritize intersectional claims over (sexual and gender-related) identity politics. Finally, participants' discourse is informed by tensions between oriental and occidental ideological patterns. A juxtaposition between Western/European liberalism and Eastern backwardness is used to challenge homonormative perceptions, which are constructed as a means of de-radicalization. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","adult; article; citizenship; female; gender; Greece; human; male; perception; politics; psychology; tension; violence; visibility; Western European","claim making; critical discursive social psychology; LGBTQI+ rights; sexual citizenship","","","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation, ΕΛ.ΙΔ.Ε.Κ, (516)","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","English","J.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs may make biased predictions w.r.t protected sensitive attributes, e.g., skin color and gender. This is because machine learning algorithms including GNNs are trained to reflect the distribution of the training data which often contains historical bias towards sensitive attributes. In addition, we empirically show that the discrimination in GNNs can be magnified by graph structures and the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. As a result, the applications of GNNs in high-stake domains such as crime rate prediction would be largely limited. Though extensive studies of fair classification have been conducted on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) data, methods to address the problem of discrimination on non-i.i.d data are rather limited. Generally, learning fair models require abundant sensitive attributes to regularize the model. However, for many graphs such as social networks, users are reluctant to share sensitive attributes. Thus, only limited sensitive attributes are available for fair GNN training in practice. Moreover, directly collecting and applying the sensitive attributes in fair model training may cause privacy issues, because the sensitive information can be leaked in data breach or attacks on the trained model. Therefore, we study a novel and important problem of learning fair GNNs with limited number of private sensitive attributes, i.e., sensitive attributes that are processed with a privacy-preserving mechanism. In an attempt to address these problems, FairGNN is proposed to eliminate the bias of GNNs whilst maintaining high node classification accuracy by leveraging graph structures and limited sensitive information. To further preserve the privacy, private sensitive attributes with privacy guarantee are obtained by injecting noise based on local differential privacy. And We further extend FairGNN to NT-FairGNN to handle the limited and private sensitive attributes to simultaneously achieve fairness and preserve privacy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGNN and NT-FairGNN in achieving fair and high-accurate classification.

More specifically, we start from the thought of Lélia de Almeida Gonzalez (1935-1994) to reflect on the myth of racial democracy as structuring a nation project in Brazil. The guiding question here is: how does the notion of Améfrica Ladina, as the foundation of a new reading of the formation of Brazilian society, complexcriticism of the myth of racial democracy? The hypothesis to be developed is that the differential of the author’s criticism lies in the identification, still in the 1970s and 1980s, of a triple form of discrimination between race, class and gender that brutally marginalizes black women – and that cannot be silenced in the understanding of brazil’s national formation.

Methods and findings: A secondary analysis of a prospective multicentre observational study in five European EDs (the TRIAGE study), including consecutive children aged <16 years who were discharged following their initial ED visit ('index' visit), in 2012-2015. Standardised data on patient characteristics, Manchester Triage System urgency classification, vital signs, clinical interventions and procedures were collected. The outcome measure was serious illness defined as hospital admission or PICU admission or death in ED after an unplanned revisit within 7 days of the index visit. Prediction models were developed using multivariable logistic regression using characteristics of the index visit to predict the likelihood of a revisit with a serious illness. The clinical model included day and time of presentation, season, age, gender, presenting problem, triage urgency, and vital signs. An extended model added laboratory investigations, imaging, and intravenous medications. Cross validation between the five sites was performed, and discrimination and calibration were assessed using random effects models. A digital calculator was constructed for clinical implementation. 7,891 children out of 98,561 children had a revisit to the ED (8.0%), of whom 1,026 children (1.0%) returned to the ED with a serious illness. Rates of revisits with serious illness varied between the hospitals (range 0.7-2.2%). The clinical model had a summary Area under the operating curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.74) and summary calibration slope of 0.83 (95% CI 0.67-0.99). 4,433 children (5%) had a risk of > = 3%, which was useful for ruling in a revisit with serious illness, with positive likelihood ratio 4.41 (95% CI 3.87-5.01) and specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.96). 37,546 (39%) had a risk <0.5%, which was useful for ruling out a revisit with serious illness (negative likelihood ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.25-0.35), sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.86-0.90)). The extended model had an improved summary AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.68-0.75) and summary calibration slope of 0.84 (95% CI 0.71-0.97). As study limitations, variables on ethnicity and social deprivation could not be included, and only return visits to the original hospital and not to those of surrounding hospitals were recorded. Conclusion: We developed a prediction model and a digital calculator which can aid physicians identifying those children at highest and lowest risks for developing a serious illness after initial discharge from the ED, allowing for more targeted safety netting advice and follow-up.  © 2021 Nijman et al.

This study interrogates the bridges and barriers to the realisation of employment equity in the eThekwini municipality of South Africa. Remarking on the discourse of employment equity, sparse research attention has been given to the bridges and barriers of employment equity, specifically in the context of the eThekwini municipality of South Africa. To address this gap, the study assesses employment equity programmes that propel employment equity and the challenges constricting the realisation of employment equity in the eThekwini municipality. A total of 15 senior managers were purposively recruited and the semi-structured interview type employed to elicit qualitative data. The data were analysed for the identification of themes with the NVivo (v.12) qualitative software and the various themes analysed with the content qualitative analytical tool. Inclusive initiatives, sufficient budget and women empowerment were shown as important employment equity programmes employed in the municipality. Difficulty in recruiting and retaining scare skills, lack of clarity and commitment to employment equity policy and political leadership and corruption were revealed as constraints to employment equity targets. The study concludes on the need for a more proactive effort on the part of the South African Department of Labour in monitoring and evaluating compliance to employment equity targets with commitment to scarce skills identification and continuous awareness to encourage more women and designated groups into the employment equity folds. © 2022 Samson Adeoluwa Adewumi.","","Discrimination; Employment; Equity; Government; Municipality; Public Organisation","","","","Richtmann Publishing Ltd","","","","","","English","Acad.

The authors analyze the impact of the size and quality of the network on the probability of finding a job through relationships and the quality of the job found through networks for men and women separately. Design/methodology/approach: For this, the authors estimate a series of logit models using the Algerian employment survey (2003 and 2007). Then, they use these models to undertake predictions of the probability of finding jobs through social networks according to the size of the social networks. Findings: The findings of this research, confirm that men and women use different methods in the job search; women use fewer connection networks in the search compared to men. There appears to exist some discrimination against women in the use of family networks; men use and find more jobs using family relationships. Overall, the jobs found through relationships are more precarious and less stable. Social networks appear to be an effective method of finding a job in Algeria but not for skilled jobs. Originality/value: There are few empirical works that analyze at the same time the role of relationship networks in integration into the labor market and the quality of employment, in particular in the case of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Understanding the intermediation mechanisms can help to develop better employment policy strategies.

Four focus-group discussions with a total of 18 participants (both males and females) were carried out using a self-developed semi-structured interview schedule. Interpretative phenomenological analysis of the transcribed interviews led to the identification of three overarching themes. The first superordinate theme, Social construction and accentuation of differences, represents the idea of biological determinism and the accentuation of anatomical differences which, as per participants' responses, lays a strong foundation for gender roles and stereotypes. This superordinate theme encompasses the role of early socialization, conformity, societal norms and expectations as well as social institutions in facilitating and perpetuating gender discrimination. The next theme, viz. Tunnel vision view of gender equality, highlights the perceived lacunas in existing policies and laws that curtail parity instead of enhancing it. It also represents participants' belief that men and women in India lack a holistic understanding of gender equality and tend to define it in a very restricted and narrow sense. Finally, the last theme i.e. Holistic and multi-level reforms, offers a culture-appropriate plan of action that, according to research participants, can help achieve holistic and sustainable gender equality in India. The present qualitative analysis provides important insights into the complex nexus of socio-cultural factors that shape collective culture-specific beliefs about gender equality. The study also offers an action-oriented framework to alleviate gender discrimination. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","India; culture; gender discrimination; gender disparity; indigenous knowledge; philosophy; social construction","Gender inequality; Gender norms; Gender socialization; Interpretative phenomenological analysis; Social constructionism","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Women's Stud.

The cross-sectional study reported here was part of the ICD-11 field test studies that took place in several countries. Twenty-eight Arab transgender adults residing in Lebanon were recruited after giving consent to participate in a structured interview with a mental health professional. The questions asked of them consisted of the following: socio-demographic data; medical history related to gender identity; experiences of gender incongruence; psychological distress; rejection; violence; and functional impairment. Results showed that Arab transgender individuals living in Lebanon report being the victims of violence, abuse, discrimination and rejection from family, peers and society in general. As a result, they develop psychological distress that is better explained by the social context in which they live, rather than by their transgender identity.

Although the field has historically focused on the content of parents’ RS, it is also important to consider caregivers’ perception of their competence to effectively teach their children to navigate their racialized world. The present study investigated patterns of RS by exploring 332 Black caregivers’ report of both content and competency. Using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), we identified three profiles of RS: Multifaceted & More Competent (MMC), Unengaged & Moderately Competent (UModC), and Negative, Stressed, & Less Competent (NSLC). Additionally, we explored the role of several previously established correlates of parental RS, including sociodemographic factors (i.e., age, gender, and socioeconomic status), caregiving status (e.g., mother, father, and aunt), and parents’ race-related experiences (i.e., history of RS, racial identity, and experiences with racial discrimination). Generally, the NSLC profile consisted of caregivers who were younger than those in the other two profiles, while those in the UModC profile tended to have younger children, relatively. Interestingly, caregivers in the UmodC profile reported receiving significantly less RS in childhood and experienced less racial discrimination than those in the other two profiles. Numerous differences were found across profiles for dimensions of racial identity. The emergence of these varied profiles, as well as the identification of factors that differentiated them, extends our understanding of RS and highlights the importance of considering parents’ notions of feeling confident, skillful, and less stressed as they navigate such a vital developmental process for their children. © 2021 Family Process Institute.","African Americans; Child; Humans; Parenting; Parents; Racism; Social Identification; Socialization; African American; article; aunt; care behavior; caregiver; child; child parent relation; childhood; controlled study; demography; development; father; female; gender; human; male; racism; social status; socialization; African American; child parent relation; racism; social behavior","African American; Competency; Parenting; Racial socialization","","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","English","Fam.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs may make predictions biased on protected sensitive attributes, e.g., skin color and gender. Because machine learning algorithms including GNNs are trained to reflect the distribution of the training data which often contains historical bias towards sensitive attributes. In addition, the discrimination in GNNs can be magnified by graph structures and the message-passing mechanism. As a result, the applications of GNNs in sensitive domains such as crime rate prediction would be largely limited. Though extensive studies of fair classification have been conducted on i.i.d data, methods to address the problem of discrimination on non-i.i.d data are rather limited. Furthermore, the practical scenario of sparse annotations in sensitive attributes is rarely considered in existing works. Therefore, we study the novel and important problem of learning fair GNNs with limited sensitive attribute information. FairGNN is proposed to eliminate the bias of GNNs whilst maintaining high node classification accuracy by leveraging graph structures and limited sensitive information. Our theoretical analysis shows that FairGNN can ensure the fairness of GNNs under mild conditions given limited nodes with known sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets also demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGNN in debiasing and keeping high accuracy. © 2021 ACM.","Classification (of information); Data mining; Graph structures; Graphic methods; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Message passing; Websites; Classification accuracy; Graph neural networks; Graph structured data; Machine learning models; Rate predictions; Real-world datasets; Sensitive attribute; Sensitive informations; Neural networks","fairness; graph neural networks; node classification","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1955851, IIS-1909702, IIS-1955851); Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, SAIT, (225003)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","14th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, WSDM 2021","167734","Virtual, Online","8 March 2021 through 12 March 2021","ACM SIGIR; ACM SIGKDD; ACM SIGMOD; ACM SIGWEB","English","WSDM - Proc.

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. It is important to ensure early detection of the virus to curb disease progression to severe COVID-19. This study aims to establish a clinical-nomogram model to predict the progression to severe COVID-19 in a timely and efficient manner. Methods: This retrospective study included 202 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Shiyan Taihe Hospital from January 17 to April 30, 2020. The patients were randomly assigned to the training dataset (n = 163, with 43 progressing to severe COVID-19) or the validation dataset (n = 39, with 10 progressing to severe COVID-19) at a ratio of 8:2. The optimal subset algorithm was applied to filter for the clinical factors most relevant to the disease progres- sion. Based on these factors, the logistic regression model was fit to distinguish severe (including severe and critical cases) from non-severe (including mild and moderate cases) COVID-19. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using the R software package to evaluate prediction performance. A clinical nomogram was established and performance assessed using the discrimination curve. Results: Risk factors, including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory and image find- ings, were recorded for the 202 patients. Eight of the 53 variables that were entered into the selection process were selected via the best subset algorithm to establish the predictive model; they included gender, age, BMI, CRP, D-dimer, TP, ALB, and involved-lobe. AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.91, 0.84 and 0.86 for the training dataset, and 0.87, 0.66, and 0.80 for the validation dataset. Conclusion: We established an efficient and reliable clinical nomogram model which showed that gender, age, and initial indexes including BMI, CRP, D-dimer, involved-lobe, TP, and ALB could predict the risk of progression to severe COVID-19. © 2021 Tu et al.","2 hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; chlorine; creatine kinase; D dimer; fibrinogen; globulin; hemoglobin; lactate dehydrogenase; potassium; sodium; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; algorithm; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body mass; clinical assessment; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; creatine kinase blood level; demography; discriminant analysis; disease exacerbation; disease severity; female; fibrinogen blood level; globulin blood level; groups by age and sex; hemoglobin blood level; human; image analysis; laboratory diagnosis; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nomogram; potassium blood level; prediction; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sodium blood level; symptom; training; validation study","Clinical nomogram model; COVID-19; Logistic regression; Progression risk","","2 hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, 9067-92-9; alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; fibrinogen, 9001-32-5; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A, ; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5","Zhuhai Municipal Special Fund for Emergency Science and T echnology Research in 2020","Dove Medical Press Ltd","","","","","","English","Ther.

Drawing on data from the 2019 National Survey of Latinos, we assess familiarity, use, and attitudes towards the term Latinx among Hispanic-Latinos. We find that linked fate, discrimination experiences, being a Democrat, being younger, and higher levels of education predict greater awareness of the term. Having ever used Latinx to identify oneself is only associated with discrimination experiences, identifying as Afro-Latino, and being female. However, the effects of discrimination experiences on having ever used the term are moderated by immigrant generation and age. Meanwhile, believing the term should be used as a panethnic label is associated with the same factors as those that explain awareness of the term, with the exception of greater education. Lastly, we find that the factors associated with preferences for ‘Latinx’ over both ‘Hispanic’ and ‘Latino’ are similar, suggesting that those who prefer the term represent a distinct subgroup of Hispanic-Latinos. Collectively, our findings suggest that, while college campuses represent critical sites for raising awareness of the term, this knowledge is not necessarily leading to its active use among Hispanic-Latinos themselves. © 2022 The Author(s).

Murray et al. sought to explore the legal status of women, particularly with regard to discrimination legislation, and concluded that the interests of trans women had begun to systematically erode the interests of non-trans women in Scotland. In this response, we aim to correct some of the erroneous statements made by Murray et al. about legal definitions of sex and gender, and about discrimination law. In critically engaging with Murray et al.’s argument we aim to build a much-needed clearer understanding of law and policy on sex and gender in Scotland, particularly as it relates to the application of the Equality Act 2010. We argue that, in that claiming that there has been policy capture in Scotland, Murray et al. have neglected to contextualise ongoing debates about sex and gender in law against the backdrop of over two decades of clear legal and policy shifts across the UK. We call for researchers and others – in Scotland and elsewhere – to take care, particularly in interpreting and applying the law, especially as it applies to marginalised minority populations, so that we do not further obfuscate or mislead on important legal and social issues. © 2020.

Methods: The study recruited 17,365 Chinese adolescents using stratified random cluster sampling method. The classical regression methods (logistic regression and Lasso regression) and machine learning model were combined to identify the most significant predictors of bullying victimization. Nomogram was built based on multivariable logistic regression model. The discrimination, calibration and generalization of nomogram were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), the calibration curve and a high-quality external validation. Results: Grade, gender, peer violence, family violence, body mass index, family structure, depressive symptoms and Internet addiction, recognized as the best combination, were included in the multivariable regression. The nomogram established based on the non-overfitting multivariable model was verified by internal validation (Area Under Curve: 0.749) and external validation (Area Under Curve: 0.755), showing decent prediction of discrimination, calibration and generalization. Conclusion: Comprehensive nomogram constructed in this study was a useful and convenient tool to evaluate the risk of bullying victimization of adolescents. It is helpful for health-care professionals to assess the risk of bullying victimization among adolescents, and to identify high-risk groups and take more effective preventive measures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Adolescent; Bullying; Crime Victims; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Nomograms; Violence; adolescent; adolescent health; Article; body mass; bullying; Chinese; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; family structure; family violence; female; human; internet addiction; machine learning; major clinical study; male; nomogram; quantitative study; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; victim; crime victim; nomogram; violence","Adolescent; Bullying victimization; Nomogram; Prediction; Validation","","","Higher education research project of Jilin province, (JGJX2021D14); Education Department of Jilin Province, (JJKH20220956SK); international innovation team of Jilin University, (2019GJTD06)","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","J.

In this paper, we proposed discrete cosine transform (DCT) to represent the face features, and DCT has the advantage of highly efficient computational algorithms. In designing the proposed gender detection system, linear discrimination analysis (LDA), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used for the classification process. Experiments were conducted using the challenging ORL, FEI, and JAFFE databases to ascertain the usefulness of the approaches.

Parents’ beliefs about race may also relate to how they interpret and respond to race-related stressors. The current study drew on the Sociohistorical Integrative Model for the Study of Stress in Black Families to examine the moderating roles of gender and racial identity subscales (i.e., racial centrality, private regard, and public regard) on the relations between race-related stressors (i.e., personal, vicarious, and anticipated racial discrimination) and racial socialization. Method: Path analyses were conducted in Mplus 8.2 using online survey data from a national sample of 567 African American parents of adolescents. Results: There were seven significant three-way interactions. Racial centrality and gender moderated the relations between both personal and vicarious racial discrimination and each racial socialization message. Private regard and gender moderated the relations between personalracial discrimination and preparation for bias and between vicarious racial discrimination and cultural socialization. Public regard and parent gender moderated the relation between personal racial discrimination and cultural socialization. Conclusions: The findings highlighted that parents’ experiences of personal, vicarious, and anticipated racial discrimination have different relations with their racial socialization messages.

The ideal speech features for ASR must also have high discriminabilities between linguistic units and be robust to such non-linguistic factors as gender, age, emotions, or noise. The discriminabilities of various features have been compared in several Zerospeech challenges to discover linguistic units without any transcriptions, in which the posteriorgrams of DPGMM clustering show strong discriminability and get several top results of ABX discrimination scores between phonemes. This paper appends DPGMM posteriorgrams to increase the discriminability of acoustic features to enhance ASR systems. To the best of our knowledge, DPGMM features, which are usually applied to such tasks as spoken term detection and zero resources tasks, have not been applied to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) before. DPGMM clustering can dynamically change the number of Gaussians until each one fits one segmental pattern of the whole speech corpus with the highest probability such that the linguistic units of different segmental patterns are clearly discriminated. Our experimental results on the WSJ corpora show our proposal stably improves ASR systems and provides even more improvement for smaller datasets with fewer resources. © 2021 IEEE.","Continuous speech recognition; Acoustic features; Discriminability; Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition; Linguistic units; Low resource asr; Segmental patterns; Speech features; Spoken term detections; Linguistics","ASR; discrimination; DPGMM; zerospeech","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP17H06101, JP17K00237)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2021 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop, SLT 2021","168092","Virtual, Shenzhen","19 January 2021 through 22 January 2021","IEEE Signal Processing Society; The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","English","IEEE Spok.

Driven by the awareness of social injustice, some sexual minority individuals may undertake collective action to counteract discrimination, but this does not apply to all members of sexual minorities. The present study used a prospective, longitudinal research design to examine how different dimensions of minority stress (i.e., perceived discrimination and internalized stigma) interact to affect group identification and collective action. A total of 628 sexual minority individuals in Hong Kong were involved in the study. The results showed that prior discriminatory experiences were positively associated with collective action at follow-up through increased levels of group identification and commitment to social justice. The moderating effect of internalized stigma was found in which perceived discrimination was not significantly related to group identification and collective action among those with high levels of internalized stigma. The study extends the literature on the rejection-identification model by understanding collective action as a form of group-level coping in the face of discrimination. It highlights the importance of fostering group identification, strengthening collective action, and mitigating internalized stigma among sexual minorities in psychological practice. © 2022, The Author(s).","adult; article; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; perceived discrimination; physiological stress; psychological practice; sexual and gender minority; social justice; stigma","Collective action; Group identification; Internalized stigma; Perceived discrimination; Sexual minorities","","","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (28609019)","Springer","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It is therefore unsurprising to find that from the first murmurings of measures designed to stem the spread and impact of COVID-19, human rights lawyers had something substantive to say, casting dire predictions should governments not act in concert with basic rights obligations, and providing guidance for how to tackle the pandemic consistent with the principles of humanity and equality ostensibly underpinning the discipline.To the extent that pandemic measures restricted basic civil and political rights, such interventions adopted tried and tested methodologies for assessing the necessity, reasonableness and proportionality of the limitations, there being little dispute that the protection of public health during a pandemic represents a legitimate objective. Much of the litigation challenging governmental decisions, the pre-enactment scrutiny of legislative amendments1 or the critique of the expansion and aggrandisement of executive powers has focused on these parameters of the debate.A related thread, of course, has been to ensure that such measures are non-discriminatory in their intent and impact, protecting the more vulnerable in the community from both unintended harm and unthinking oversight. Again, international human rights law is presented as providing useful guidance for this exercise in policy-making, from the positive duty to take reasonable, objective and proportionate measures ‘to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination’2to the identification of ‘minimum core obligations’3of key socioeconomic rights, including in the equitable distribution of health care and the access to water, so crucial to government responses to the pandemic.Indeed, the metaphor of the ‘tool kit’ of rights is ubiquitous in the commentary, alongside the notion that they provide a ‘lens’ for looking at the crisis with clarity and humanity.4Both characterisations reflect an instrumentalist approach that betrays a certain bravado, a certain faith, or at least trust, in the relevance and efficacy of the human rights method. The question rarely asked, perhaps surprisingly given rights scholars’ propensity to be hard on our discipline, is whether it is, in fact, up to the task. Is human rights practice and theory, in other words, equipped to address the challenges posed by the pandemic? The question becomes all the more pertinent when it comes to a core challenge presented by the very scale of a pandemic—tackling the structural inequalities which shape and determine the (un)equal enjoyment of basic rights, especially the right to health.From an epidemiological perspective, it was not hard to predict that the pandemic would have a disparate impact on different communities. Epidemiologists have long charted the nexus between health outcomes and social marginality.5 Factors such as education, employment status, income level, gender and ethnicity all have a marked influence on a person’s health. This was evident early in the pandemic, and could at first blush be readily analysed through a rights lens. The right to clean water and sanitation, for instance, was implicated in the ubiquitous recommendation to wash our hands—a practice out of reach for millions living in poverty in the global south as well as for many in the north,6 including First Nations peoples in Canada, Australia and the United States (‘US’).7 Similarly, the racially-constructed gap in access to health care in the US was identified as responsible in part for the high level of deaths amongst the African American and Latinx communities.8 Precarity, moreover, took on many unexpected guises, such as the devastating impact of exposure to the virus on ‘frontline’ and ‘essential’ workers—new, ill-defined categories for the purposes of discrimination law, where the most poorly paid members of the workforce overnight became the most valued.9 The fact that so many such workers came from minority and lower socio-economic communities further highlighted the cascading effects and complications of intersectional disadvantage.10Given this context, and surveying the many comments, documents and instruments promulgated by academics, non-governmental organisations (‘NGO s’), treaty bodies and special procedures over recent months, there is a sense that for many in the epistemic community of rights advocates this is a moment—an opportunity—to leverage the confluence of public health and human rights,11and to employ the language, principles, institutions and influence of the human rights movement to tackle the structural and intersectional impediments to the enjoyment of equal rights ‘exposed’ by the pandemic.12This article considers whether international human rights law and its institutions are in fact equipped with the ‘tools’ to meet these core structural challenges. It does this by taking as its principal case study the movement to recognize and address racism as a public health crisis, a largely grassroots initiative that has drawn more upon on the interdisciplinary work of public health advocates than the language and principles of human rights, despite the clear applicability of the latter to its critique and agenda. Although predating 2020, this movement received unprecedented impetus from the confluence of two related phenomenon with global import: the pandemic’s manifestly discriminatory impact, and the new visibility, voice and political viability of the Black Lives Matter (‘BLM’) movement. The article considers the relevance of this moment to international human rights law, the adequacy of the response from its key institutions, and the conservative backlash to these developments challenging the very idea of structural racism. In doing so, it argues that we seem to be witnessing a new stage of the culture wars around the language, method and assumptions of human rights law with which the discipline must engage pragmatically and strategically. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2022","","","","","","Brill Academic Publishers","","","","","","English","Aust.

It's sometimes referred to as “opinion mining” or “emotion extraction”. Sentiment Analysis is a growing area of study in text mining and a popular research subject for opinion mining in education, which analyses and comprehends students’ attitudes toward their learning in order to improve the quality of decision-making. More innovative approaches have been developed in online education, which provide an efficient way to learn irrespective of Gender, geographical discrimination, age, etc. As more and more reviews or feedback are posted during online classes, these messages should be correctly classified to identify the theme behind them. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based classification models are used to solve sentiment classification problems. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are most frequently used algorithms for Natural Language processing (NLP). It allows us to have a deeper understanding of the student’s emotions. It may also be used to recognize and analyse feelings in user comments or reviews on various blogs, websites, social media, online communities, and other sites in order to better understand their perspectives. Thus, the most addressed domain was the use of sentiment analysis in the context of higher education and the evaluation of teaching quality. It would be very helpful for instructors to improve learning strategies by assessing both the instructors and students’ progress. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolutional neural networks; Data mining; Decision trees; E-learning; Education computing; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quality control; Recurrent neural networks; Social networking (online); Students; Support vector machines; Deep learning; Emotion extractions; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Opinion mining; Polarity; Sentimental analyse; Text-mining; Sentiment analysis","Deep learning; Emotion extraction; Machine learning; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Opinion mining; Polarity; Sentimental analysis; Text mining","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","1st International Conference on Innovations in Intelligent Computing and Communication, ICIICC 2021","288399"," Bhubaneswar","16 December 2022 through 17 December 2022","","English","Commun.

The aim of this study was to develop and test a path model analysis of psychological aggression with hostile and benevolent sexism as explanatory variables. Materials and methods. 163 women were selected non-randomly from Mexico City and Metropolitan area. Measures of ambivalent sexism and psychological aggression adapted to Mexican population were applied. A path model analysis was carried out as well as a multivariate analyses of variance. Results. Main results showed that hostile sexism significantly predicts the index of psychological aggression. It was also observed that catholic religion was associated with a greater level of benevolent sexism, while a low economic status with a higher degree of hostile sexism. Conclusions. Findings obtained allowed the identification of some risk factors associated with sexism and psychological aggression. Thus, this research encourages the design and implementation of effective intervention strategies addressing such factors in order to diminish ambivalent sexism and psychological aggression, particularly in the context of Latin American cities. © 2021, Revista Lasallista de Investigacion.

The modern case-mix of prehospital patients is broad and complex, diverging from the traditional ‘time critical accident and emergency’ patients. It now includes many low-acuity patients and those with social care and mental health needs. In the ambulance service, transport decisions are the hardest to make and paramedics decide to take more patients to the ED than would have a clinical benefit. As such, this study asked the following research questions: In adult patients attending the ED by ambulance, can prehospital information predict an avoidable attendance? What is the simulated transportability of the model derived from the primary outcome? A linked dataset of 101,522 ambulance service and ED ambulance incidents linked to their respective ED care record from the whole of Yorkshire between 1st July 2019 and 29th February 2020 was used as the sample for this study. A machine learning method known as XGBoost was applied to the data in a novel way called Internal-External Cross Validation (IECV) to build the model. The results showed great discrimination with a C-statistic of 0.81 (95%CI 0.79–0.83) and excellent calibration with an O: E ratio was 0.995 (95% CI 0.97–1.03), with the most important variables being a patient’s mobility, their physiological observations and clinical impression with psychiatric problems, allergic reactions, cardiac chest pain, head injury, non-traumatic back pain, and minor cuts and bruising being the most important. This study has successfully developed a decision-support model that can be transformed into a tool that could help paramedics make better transport decisions on scene, known as the SINEPOST model. It is accurate, and spatially validated across multiple geographies including rural, urban, and coastal. It is a fair algorithm that does not discriminate new patients based on their age, gender, ethnicity, or decile of deprivation. It can be embedded into an electronic Patient Care Record system and automatically calculate the probability that a patient will have an avoidable attendance at the ED. © 2022 Miles et al.

Previous research has shown that the preference for sons is a primary cause of selective abortion, skewed population sex ratios, and discrimination against daughters. This study provides evidence for the beneficial effects of maternal education on reducing the preference for sons. Our identification comes from the comparison between biological sisters in 67 developing countries across the globe. Quantitatively, a one-year increase in maternal education reduces the preferred number of sons over daughters by 0.17 percentage points. Our heterogeneity analysis further shows that the beneficial effects of maternal education are much larger for the rural and poor population.

Though the Indian Constitution bars discrimination based on sex or gender, inheritance laws do not envisage transgender persons or a change in gender identity. They are based on a binary notion of gender. individuals must choose between conforming to their assigned gender or not availing their rights. Moreover, successors are often difficult to identify as individuals may lack documentation, could not marry, or cannot prove adoption. Whi courts attempt to address these challenges, they leave it to their subjective satisfaction on when to secure the rights of transgender persons.

While most research on the fairness of machine learning models in education focuses on discrimination by gender or race, other variables such as parental educational background or home literacy environment are known to impact children's literacy skills too. This paper, therefore, evaluates three different implementations of in-session dropout prediction models used in a learning platform to accompany German school classes with respect to their fairness based on four different fairness measures. We evaluate the models for discrimination of gender, migration background, parental education, and home literacy environment. While predictive parity and equal opportunity are rarely above the defined threshold, predictive equality and slicing analysis indicate that model quality is slightly better for boys, users with higher parental education, users with less than ten books, and users with a migrant background. Furthermore, our analysis of the temporal prediction shows that with increasing accuracy of the model, the fairness decreases. In conclusion, we see that the fairness of a model depends on 1) the fairness measure, 2) the evaluated demographic group and 3) the data with which the model is trained.

Thus, we investigated the RAE in youth female and male soccer and futsal players in Portugal, using nationwide data. Birthdates of 5,306 female and 126,285 male soccer players, and 2,437 female and 23,988 male futsal players (U7–U19), registered in Portugal during the season 2019–2020, and Portuguese National teams (from U15 to AA soccer teams and from U17 to AA futsal teams) were analyzed. Data were categorized into age groups and certification levels [no certification, basic football training center, football school, and training institution] of the respective clubs/academies. Birthdates were stratified from the start of the selection year using quartiles (Q) and semesters (S). Differences between the observed and expected birthdate distributions were analyzed using chi-square statistics, and RAEs were calculated using odds ratios (OR). In both soccer and futsal, female players, in the age category U9, RAEs were found (Q1 vs. Q4, OR: 1.49 and 1.84, respectively). In male soccer, differences in the birthdate distribution were observed in all age categories (U7–U19) with significant OR between all comparisons (Q and S). In contrast, an over-representation of young male futsal players (Q1 vs. Q4) was observed only in the age categories U7 and U9 (OR: 1.54 and 1.34, respectively). The stratification by certification level showed a significant RAE for all certification levels in male soccer players. In contrast, in male futsal players, the RAE was significant only in clubs and academies with the highest level. For National teams, the RAE was more pronounced in male soccer, particularly in the U16 and U17 (OR: 9.84 and 12.36, respectively). Data showed a RAE in female and male youth soccer and futsal, particularly in male, younger age categories, and in clubs and academies having a higher certification level, which could be accompanied by a loss of valuable elite players during the youth phase of their careers. Thus, adjustments in the systems and structure of talent identification are recommended to prevent RAE-related discrimination in youth soccer and futsal. © Copyright © 2021 Figueiredo, Seabra, Brito, Galvão and Brito.","","birthdate; football; gender; player selection; youth development","","","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","English","Front.

This study investigates how internal and external stressors, mental health and health risk behaviours differ between asexual youth and other SMY. The study uses a sub-group analysis (n = 5,314) of an online survey of self-identified sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY). Descriptive and inferential statistics compare asexual (n = 669) to non-asexual (n = 4,645) respondents across two developmental phases–adolescence (age 14–19) and young adulthood (age 20–25)–while accounting for gender minority (e.g., transgender) self-identification. Results indicate that asexual youth had significantly higher internalised LGBTQ-phobia and tended to have poorer mental health (e.g., higher rates of depression), while having experienced less interpersonal discrimination/prejudice and having engaged in fewer health risk behaviours (e.g., substance use). Findings have implications for clinical practice. Future research should continue to investigate the impact of risk and protective factors on outcomes for asexual young people. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","adolescents; Asexual; mental health; sexual minority; stress; young adults","","","Ontario HIV Treatment Network, OHTN; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (475-2015-0780, 895-2018-1000)","Routledge","","","","","","English","Psychol.

Anyway, adopting a new and universal standard category for gender dysphoria diagnosis, does not resolve the issue of an appropriate epidemiological estimate of the prevalence of the condition. The first task for researchers in the field is to decide whom to count as “trans”, and by what means. Indeed, trans people are a very diverse group (Winter et al., 2016). According to Thompson and King (2015), conceptual basis of epidemiological studies is intrinsically wrong: so, while the aim of research in the field is to promote health and welfare, the means by which trans people are identified actually perpetuate the problem of stigma and inequity in access to healthcare services (Thompson and King, 2015). Trans people face many structural barriers to access gender-affirming care, including lack of insurance, coverage exclusions, coverage denials. Moreover, they usually avoid seeking care out of fear of discrimination. Reisner et al. (2015) propose eight recommendations following the model of the GenIUSS Group, to guide inclusive sex and gender adult population-based research (Table 3; GenIUSS Group, 2014). Indeed, if epidemiologic research allowed us to precisely identify trans people, it would be possible to also detect those conditions that are more frequently associated to gender incongruence, thereby activating more specific interventions aimed at improving these people's quality of life. Having a uniformity of terminology in recognizing these people perhaps can increasingly lead to less discriminatory stigmatization and labelling. © 2022","adult; article; controlled study; fear; female; gender identity; human; insurance; male; nomenclature; quality of life; social stigma; transgender; welfare; winter","Epidemiologic research; Gender identity; Gender incongruence; Healthcare services","","","","Elsevier Masson s.r.l.","","","","","","English","Sexologies","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Further, the authors tested whether psychological distress mediated the relationship between intersectional minority stress and Alcohol Use Disorder. Modified targeted nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants. Regression analysis revealed that when examined concomitantly, race and sexual orientation-based discrimination served as a unique predictor of alcohol-related outcomes; sexism was not a unique predictor. Psychological distress was a significant mediator in the relationship between intersectional minority stress and alcohol-related outcomes. Future research should expand on the detrimental impact of intersectional minority stress on alcohol-health disparities, including the identification of mental health variables that mediate and/or moderate this relationship. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","African Americans; alcohol use; Latinas; minority stress; sexual minorities","","","","Routledge","","","","","","English","J.

The difference in recognition, tolerance, and acceptability of ambiguous discriminatory and harassing scenarios has rarely been studied, yet improved understanding in this area may lead to improved identification and prevention of it. Prior studies suggest female medical students perceive harassing or belittling actions as more harsh, yet few studies discuss wider contexts and which factors influence acceptance or tolerance. This study aims to characterize and compare factors that influence the perceived tolerance and acceptability of scenarios that include discrimination and harassment. Methods: In this exploratory study, quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a survey sent out to a population of 1,318 medical students, asking for personal responses to a range of scenarios, which included different forms of discrimination and harassment in varying degrees of ambiguity. Sixteen students were then invited to focus groups to explore factors in more depth. Quantitative data were analyzed with t-tests and logistic regression; qualitative data with framework analysis. Findings: 20 percent of students (n = 259) responded to the survey. Being singled out based on ethnicity to speak on behalf of a group of people was most negatively perceived (mean professionalism rating on a 1:lowest/worst to 5:highest/best scale, 2.43/5.00, 95% CI 2.31- 2.54), while gender-stereotyped career advice was rated least negative (mean personal rating 3.36/5, 95% CI 3.22- 3.50). Students were more likely to perceive scenarios as unacceptable if they identified as female, black, or from an ethnic minority; had a LGBTQ+ orientation; or had personal experience of discrimination and harassment. Perception of scenarios was influenced by perceived intention and seniority, the gender of those involved, student and relationship factors, and its setting. Conclusions: Scenarios containing discrimination and harassment were perceived as more problematic if students identified as women, black or ethnic minority, had an LGBTQ+ orientation, or had previous experience, and in certain situations, whilst white male students perceived less discrimination and harassment. This highlights the importance of including a diverse range of voices in medical education leadership, and training about discrimination and harassment of all involved in teaching. © 2021 Common Ground Research Networks, Leona Richards, Khadijah Ginwalla, Sana Hasan, Anna Kathryn Taylor, Paul Beckley, Marion Matheson, Daniel Zahra, Halima Shah, Gene Feder, Jonathan Broad.

The specific objectives of this study are to predict the future country-wise COVID 19 incidences, to locate the influences of individual socio-economic factors on the predictions, to analyze the clusters of countries on the basis of influential explanatory variables and thus to search for intra-cluster and inter-cluster characteristics. To that respect this study has used the deep neural network based temporal fusion transformer for the predictions, Pearson correlation to understand the influence of socio-economic variables on incidence and hierarchical clustering for cluster-analysis. The findings conclude that the inter-country infection related predictions vary widely over spatio-temporal variability and different socio-economic variables have different influences over this inter-country variability. It is observed that greater the population size, stronger the global connectedness, larger the social cohesion, higher the population density and meaningful the gender based discrimination higher will be the future spread. On the other hand greater the development level, higher the nutritional status, greater the access to quality health services, greater the urban population and greater the material poverty lesser will be the future spread. Definite spatial pattern of influence of the explanatory variables emerged from cluster analysis. To minimize the vulnerability towards unforeseen biological calamities modern and sustainable development policies are needed; affluence may not guarantee less infection.

Since the existing detection methods are static detection and cannot obtain the dynamic vestibular information of patients, this paper proposes a simple method for detecting vestibular dysfunction based on gait signals of subjects. Methods: In our study, the walking patterns of dynamic gait index (DGI) and inertial sensor were adopted for the data acquisition. Time-domain, frequency-domain and non-linear features were extracted from inertial sensor signals. Then the Relief algorithm was used for feature selection. Two classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were used to classify the patients with vestibular dysfunction and the healthy controls. Results: The highest accuracy of 84.79% was achieved based on magnetometer features and SVM classifier. To further improve classification results, features of three sensor signals were combined and applied to two classifiers. Combined features and RF classifier achieved a classification accuracy of 86.5%. Conclusion: The detection of vestibular dysfunction based on inertial sensors might be simple, accurate and easy to implement in clinical examination, which provides a new method for the clinical diagnosis of vestibular function. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Algorithms; Gait; Humans; Support Vector Machine; Walking; Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Frequency domain analysis; Inertial navigation systems; Time domain analysis; Common disease; Detection methods; Gait; Inertial sensor; Random forests; Sensor signals; SIMPLE method; Static detections; Support vectors machine; Vestibular function; accelerometry; adult; age; algorithm; Article; calculation; classifier; clinical examination; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; Dynamic Gait Index; entropy; feature selection; female; Fourier transform; gait; gender; human; information processing; magnetometry; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pattern recognition; radial basis function; random forest; relief algorithm; support vector machine; velocity; vestibular disorder; walking; Support vector machines","Gait; Inertial sensor; RF; SVM; Vestibular function","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2018MF027)","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","English","Comput.

Yet trans people continue to face minority stressors, including structural violence (i.e., discrimination, violence, and stigma), which may interfere with the achievement of these milestones. Among trans women specifically, however, potential associations between gender developmental milestones and structural violence are not well characterized in the literature. In a sample of Filipinx (i.e., an inclusive term for describing non-binary genders in the Philippines) trans women who are sexually active with men (trans-WSM), we thus sought to: (a) describe the mean ages at which gender developmental milestones occur and (b) examine the associations between structural violence and mean ages at which at which Filipinx trans-WSM experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Methods Using data from Project #ParaSaAtin, an online survey of Filipinx trans-WSM (n = 139), we mapped age-estimates per trans-specific milestones and then tested whether structural violence is associated with the mean age at which trans women experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Results Overall, participants who reported higher levels of discrimination, stigma, and violence also experienced a later age for nearly each milestone (i.e., initial self-Awareness of transfeminine identity, transfeminine expression in private, transfeminine expression in public, first consensual oral/vaginal/anal sex with a cisgender male partner, first consensual oral/vaginal/ anal sex with a cisgender male partner as a trans women, and hormone integration) (all p-values 0.05). Of note, the single exception to this pattern was the non-significant association between stigma and initial disclosure of transfeminine identification to another person. Conclusion Results are consistent with psychological literature outlining a temporal sequence of developmental milestones among young trans-WSM. For young trans-WSM in the Philippines, data from this study demonstrate significant associations between structural violence and the achievement of developmental milestones. These findings highlight the need for trauma-informed, strengths-based programming and institutional policies that measure and mitigate anti-Trans violence. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

Many of these patterns reflect important real-world phenomena driving interactions between the various users and items; other patterns may be irrelevant or reflect undesired discrimination, such as discrimination in publishing or purchasing against authors who are women or ethnic minorities. In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to one dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms tend to propagate at least some of each user’s tendency to rate or read male or female authors into their resulting recommendations, although they differ in both the strength of this propagation and the variance in the gender balance of the recommendation lists they produce. The data, experimental design, and statistical methods are designed to be reusable for studying potentially discriminatory social dimensions of recommendations in other domains and settings as well. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.","Signal filtering and prediction; Collaborative filtering algorithms; Content creators; Ethnic minorities; One dimension; Recommender algorithms; Social concerns; Social dimensions; Useful patterns; Collaborative filtering","Discrimination; Gender bias; Recommender systems; Research methods","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1751278, IIS 17-51278)","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","English","User Model User Adapt Interact","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, it is still unclear whether the advantage of fear depends on temporal attentional resources. We used the “attentional blink” (AB) paradigm to investigate the role of temporal attention in the processing of fear. We manipulated the emotionality (fear, neutral) of the second target (T2), and T1-T2 interval time (lag 3, lag 8). Four experiments were designed to reduce gradually the available attentional resources for emotional T2 by manipulating the number of letters in the letter search task (Experiments 1 and 3) or in the letter working memory task (Experiment 2 and 4) in the T1 task. The results showed that the AB magnitude of fearful T2 was smaller than that of neutral T2, and this effect was not influenced by T1 difficulty in Experiment 1 (letter search task: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 letters) and Experiment 2 (letter working memory task: 1, 2, 3, and 4 letters), in which the T2 task was the intact face detection task. In Experiment 3, when the T2 was gender discrimination task, the AB magnitude of fearful T2 was smaller than that of neutral T2 in the low and medium T1- difficulty conditions (2 and 4 letters in the letter search task), but not in the high T1-difficulty condition (6 letters in the letter search task). Experiment 4 was a replication of Experiment 3, but with the working memory T1 task used in Experiment 2. As expected, the results of Experiment 4 replicated the results of Experiment 3 and provided more evidence that the processing advantage of fearful T2 was modulated by T1 difficulty. These results suggested that the priority of fear required attentional resources. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Fear; Rapid serial visual presentation; Task difficulty; Temporal attention","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31470980)","Springer","","","","","","English","Curr.

Whereas treatment options such as voice therapy or surgery exist, a quantitative measure of the treatment outcome is missing. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel regression-based method to predict the perceived femininity or masculinity of a speaker's voice. To this end, 86 speakers (34 male, 35 female, 17 transgender) were recorded reading aloud a German standard passage. Subsequently a group of 28 laypersons and 13 experts rated the femininity/masculinity of these speech samples. Each spoken utterance was automatically analysed with respect to nine different pitch-, resonance- and voice quality-related acoustic features. The ratings were the targets for three prediction models (linear, logistic and decision tree regression) based on the extracted features. The results show that, generally, f0 and the vocal tract length (VTL) are the main predictors. Furthermore, the continuous outcome logistic regression model with f0, smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS), Jitter and VTL as input features performed best and achieved promising results with a cross-validated root mean-squared error of 0.117 on the normalized ratings [0, 1].

A person manifests this attribute naturally in gait, body gesture, facial, including speech. For that reason, automatic gender recognition (AGR) has become an interesting sub-topic in speech recognition systems that can be found in many speech technology applications. However, retrieving salient gender-related information from a speech signal is a challenging problem since speech contains abundant information apart from gender. The paper intends to compare the performance of human vocal tract-based model i.e., linear prediction coefficients (LPC) and human auditory-based model i.e., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) which are popularly used in other speech recognition tasks by experimentation of optimal feature parameters and classifier’s parameters. The audio data used in this study was obtained from 93 speakers uttering selected words with different vowels. The two feature vectors were tested using two classification algorithms namely, discriminant analysis (DA) and artificial neural network (ANN). Although the experimental results were promising using both feature parameters, the best overall accuracy rate of 97.07% was recorded using MFCC-ANN techniques with almost equal performance for male and female classes. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Since gender-related conflicts have escalated in Korea especially among younger adults, we predicted that (1) there would be gender differences in one’s perception of gender discrimination in Korea and (2) such differences would be particularly large among younger adults. Consistent with the predictions, we found that Korean men underestimated discrimination against women and overestimated discrimination against men, relative to Korean women. Also, such tendency was more pronounced among younger men than among older men without significant differences in sexism between them. Moreover, young men claimed that men were at least as discriminated against as women in Korea unlike other groups who believed that discrimination against women was larger than discrimination against men. Our data also suggest that such perception of gender discrimination among younger Korean men is possibly due to their beliefs that social atmosphere in Korea is disadvantageous to their gender. We further showed that gender differences in perception of gender discrimination were associated with corresponding differences in emotional reactions (i.e., anger) to gender discrimination. © The Author(s) 2022.","","gender differences; gender discrimination; group status; intergroup relations; reverse discrimination","","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Psychol.

However, many in the network environment contain gender discrimination and aggressive information, which magnify gender stereotypes and gender inequality. Therefore, the filtering of illegal content such as gender discrimination is essential to maintain a healthy social network environment. In this paper, we describe the system developed by our team for SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification. More specifically, we introduce two novel systems to analyze these posts: a multimodal multi-task learning architecture that combines Bertweet for text encoding with ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) for image representation, and a single-flow transformer structure which combines text embeddings from BERT-Embeddings and image embeddings from several different modules such as EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). In this manner, we show that the information behind them can be properly revealed. Our approach achieves good performance on each of the two subtasks of the current competition, ranking 12th for Subtask A (0.746 macro F1-score), 10th for Subtask B (0.706 macro F1-score) while exceeding the official baseline results by high margins. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","Computational linguistics; Image representation; Semantics; Social networking (online); Embeddings; F1 scores; Gender discrimination; Image texts; Joint models; Model method; Multi tasks; Multi-modal; Network environments; Subtask; Embeddings","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","181952","Seattle","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","English","SemEval - Int.

Despite rapid development in the area, most prior studies have been limited to regression-based methods, undermining the possibility of addressing complex models with multiple mediators and/or heterogeneous effects. We propose a novel estimation method that effectively addresses complex models. Moreover, we develop a sensitivity analysis for possible violations of an identification assumption. The proposed method and sensitivity analysis are demonstrated with data from the Midlife Development in the US study to investigate the degree to which disparities in cardiovascular health at the intersection of race and gender would be reduced if the distributions of education and perceived discrimination were the same across intersectional groups. © The Author(s) 2022.","","multiple mediators, heterogeneous effects, disparity reduction, disparity remaining, omitted confounding","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R00AG052458, U54MD013368); National Institute on Aging, NIA","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Sociol.

However, early detection of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during CPR using waveform capnography remains a challenge. The aim of the study was to investigate if the assessment of ETCO2 variation during chest compression pauses could allow for ROSC detection. We hypothesized that a decay in ETCO2 during a compression pause indicates no ROSC while a constant or increasing ETCO2 indicates ROSC. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) episodes treated by the advanced life support (ALS). Continuous chest compressions and ventilations were provided manually. Segments of capnography signal during pauses in chest compressions were selected, including at least three ventilations and with durations less than 20 s. Segments were classified as ROSC or non-ROSC according to case chart annotation and examination of the ECG and transthoracic impedance signals. The percentage variation of ETCO2 between consecutive ventilations was computed and its average value, ΔETavg, was used as a single feature to discriminate between ROSC and non-ROSC segments. Results A total of 384 segments (130 ROSC, 254 non-ROSC) from 205 OHCA patients (30.7% female, median age 66) were analyzed. Median (IQR) duration was 16.3 (12.9,18.1) s. ΔETavg was 0.0 (-0.7, 0.9)% for ROSC segments and -11.0 (-14.1, -8.0)% for non-ROSC segments (p < 0.0001). Best performance for ROSC detection yielded a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI: 90.1%, 98.1%) and a specificity of 94.9% (91.4%, 97.1%) for all ventilations in the segment. For the first 2 ventilations, duration was 7.7 (6.0, 10.2) s, and sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (83.5%, 94.2%) and 89.4 (84.9%, 92.6%), respectively. Our method allowed for ROSC detection during the first compression pause in 95.4% of the patients. Conclusion Average percent variation of ETCO2 during pauses in chest compressions allowed for ROSC discrimination. This metric could help confirm ROSC during compression pauses in ALS settings. © 2021 Gutiérrez et al.

A facial image was paired with a sentence describing an immoral act or a neutral act. Participants imagined the person performing the actions described in the sentence during the learning phase. Then, in the crowding phase, the target face was briefly presented in the left or right peripheral visual fields. Participants were required to judge the gender or morality of the target face in Experiment 1 and to choose the target face from two faces in Experiment 2. In both experiments, flankers were presented around the target face in the flanker condition, whereas no flankers were presented in the no-flanker condition. Experiment 1 indicated that the accuracy of judgments about the morality of a crowded face was higher for immoral faces than for neutral faces. This demonstrates that morality is preferentially extracted even when conscious access to facial representations is limited. Experiment 2 showed that the accuracy of selecting the flanked face from two faces was higher for neutral faces than for immoral faces. These indicated that the morality processed under the crowding impaired the discrimination of the facial identity. © The Author(s) 2022.","","crowding; morality; visual awareness","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP18J12574, JP20J00838)","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","i-Perception","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

According to information collected by the Ministry of the Interior of Spain, the category of sexual orientation and gender identity is subject to the third-highest number of registered hate crimes, ranking behind racism/xenophobia and ideology. However, most of the existing computational approaches to online hate detection simultaneously attempt to address all types of discrimination, leading to weaker prototype performances. These approaches focus on other reasons for hate—primarily racism and xenophobia—and usually focus on English messages. Furthermore, few detection models have used manually generated databases as a training corpus. Using supervised machine learning techniques, the present research sought to overcome these limitations by developing and evaluating an automatic detector of hate speech motivated by gender and sexual orientation. The focus was Spanish-language posts on Twitter. For this purpose, eight predictive models were developed from an ad hoc generated training corpus, using shallow modeling and deep learning. The evaluation metrics showed that the deep learning algorithm performed significantly better than the shallow modeling algorithms, and logistic regression yielded the best performance of the shallow algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

However, to date, no known empirical research has explored the consequences of exposure to humor that criticizes, confronts, and questions sexism (i.e., subversive humor against sexism or feminist humor). In the present research, we conducted two experiments to analyze the impact of exposure to subversive humor against sexism (vs. neutral humor) on the degree of involvement in collective action for gender equality, taking into account the feminist identity of participants. The results of Study 1 (n = 135) revealed that Spanish women and men with weaker feminist identification showed a higher proclivity to participate in collective action for gender equality after being exposed to subversive humor against sexism (vs. neutral humor). Study 2 (n = 134 Spanish women and men) replicated these results and expanded them to behavioral intentions to participate in this type of collective action. Our findings show the potential implications of using this type of humor for collective action for gender equality. Overall, subversive humor against sexism may function as a supportive tool to combat sexist attitudes, discrimination against women, and gender inequality by raising awareness in people with lower feminist identity to get them more involved in collective action. This approach would facilitate recruiting activists, getting more media coverage, and building a collective identity supporting mobilization against sexism. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; attitude; awareness; female; feminism; human; human experiment; humor; major clinical study; male; sexism; Spaniard","Collective action for gender equality; Feminist humor; Feminist identification; Sexism; Subversive humor against sexism","","","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, en:MINECO, MEC, (B-SEJ-135-UGR18, PSI2016–79812-P)","Springer","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study aimed to identify the associations among BMSM between recent police harassment and psychosocial vulnerability, psychological distress, and depression measured six months later. Data come from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 061 Study, a cohort study of BMSM recruited in 6 U.S. cities (Atlanta, GA, Boston, MA, Los Angeles, CA, New York, NY, San Francisco, CA, and Washington DC). Participants completed baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up interviews. A convenience sample of 1553 BMSM was recruited between July 2009 and October 2010 of whom 1155 returned for a follow-up interview 12 months later. Accounting for previous police interaction, poverty, psychopathology, drug use, and alcohol use, we estimated associations between recent police harassment reported at the 6 month follow-up interview and 12 month outcomes including psychosocial vulnerability (elevated racial/sexual identity incongruence), psychological distress (being distressed by experiences of racism and/or homophobia), and depression. About 60% of men reported experiencing police harassment between the baseline and 6-month interview due to their race and/or sexuality. Adjusted analyses suggested police harassment was independently associated with a 10.81 (95% CI: 7.97, 13.66) point increase and 8.68 (95% CI: 6.06, 11.30) point increase in distress due to experienced racism and distress due to experienced homophobia scores, respectively. Police harassment perceived to be dually motivated predicted disproportionate levels of distress. Police harassment is prevalent and associated with negative influences on psychosocial vulnerability and psychological distress among BMSM. Reducing exposure to police harassment may improve the psychosocial health of BMSM. © 2021 The Authors","adult; Article; cohort analysis; depression; disease association; distress syndrome; follow up; gender identity; harassment; homophobia; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; men who have sex with men; mental health; motivation; personal experience; police harassment; prediction; racism; social psychology; United States; vulnerable population","Black men who have sex with men; Mental health; Minority health; Police; Racism; Sexual minority","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01DA044037); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (1 AI068619, 48 DP006382); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","SSM Popul.

This study aims to identify mechanisms through which these factors are reproduced on all levels of the gender system (individual, family, social milieu, professional milieu, state institutions). The focus is made on the case of the Autonomous Territorial Unit Gagauzia in Moldova. The study relies on systems analysis methods and approaches based on the institutional economic theory, systems theory, and gender economics to assess the impact of socio-economic factors on the likelihood of intimate partner violence (IPV) in this region. In Gagauzia, there is a decline in women’s opportunities to realize their economic rights and ensure their financial independence. While the incomes of households are falling, gender discrimination, including physical violence, is perceived as justified by more and more people. Another contributing factor is the lack of effective mechanisms for IPV prevention. The factors contributing to IPV are related to the system of specialized institutions, which impose sanctions for violating the rules of gender stereotypical behavior. The study proposes a set of projects to promote more egalitarian norms on all levels of the gender system. © 2022 Elena V.

According to Lance W Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg, digital activism involves a logic of ‘connective action’, in which collective action and collective identity lose importance. To assess the validity of this theory, I focus on personal testimony campaigns that have by now become a familiar digital tactic, especially in online mobilisations around issues of gender and sexuality. Drawing on discourse analysis of some of the most prominent examples, from #MeToo to #GirlsLikeUs, I argue that more than a logic of connection, what is at stake here is a ‘logic of collection’, involved in gathering personal testimonies as specimens of various grievances people are affected by (sexual harassment, discrimination, etc.). Aggregating personal testimonies around shared hashtags provides a means to construct and/or trasform the collective identity of the groups involved in order to raise their self-awareness and place them in a better position to engage in collective action. These practices thus suggest the need to overcome the opposition between personal and collective identity inherent in the theory of ‘connective action’, and refocus research on the forms of online identification that connect these two levels. © The Author(s) 2022.","","Collective identity; connective action; individualisation; personal testimony; social media","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","New Media and Society","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

While the use of intrusive techniques such as retina scans and finger print identification has resulted in highly accurate systems, the scalability of such systems in real-world applications such as surveillance and border security has been limited. As a branch of biometrics research, the origin of soft biometrics could be traced back to need for non-intrusive solutions for extracting physiological traits of a person. Following high number of research outcomes reported in the literature on soft biometrics, this paper aims to consolidate the scope of soft biometrics research across four thematic schemes (i) a detailed review of soft biometrics research data sets, their annotation strategies and building a largest novel collection of soft traits; (ii) the assessment of metrics that affect the performance of soft biometrics system; (iii) a comparative analysis on feature and modality level fusion reported in the literature for enhancing the system performance; and (iv) a performance analysis of hybrid soft biometrics recognition system using multi-scale criterion. The paper also presents a detailed analysis on the global traits associated to person identity such as gender, age and ethnicity.

There are only a handful of resources for or about male-identified trans sex workers; this chapter provides an analysis of the few existing studies and presents the results of a new online survey. Trans individuals in the sex work industry are most often drawn to sex work out of economic necessity because they are frequently excluded from the formal economy, where they are often subjected to transphobic discrimination and where their identification documents may not reflect their gender, gender identity, or gender expression. Some trans sex workers may find the self-determination offered by sex work empowering and may discover in the sex industry a supportive group of other trans sex workers. The criminalization of sex work poses particular danger for trans people, who face an elevated risk of being prosecuted based on their gender identity. Moreover, trans people are often victims of violence and discrimination. Because street sex work can be especially problematic for male-presenting trans persons, most trans masculine sex workers participate in online sex work rather than street work or brothel work. In addition, trans sex workers also mental and physical health-related issues, including a high prevalence of depression and increased risk of HIV and sexual assault. The respondents to the survey of male-identified trans sex workers reported being fearful of physical violence, rape, and murder. Many were also afraid of being arrested and not being able to go to the police after violent incidents occurred. An additional concern was the fear of being outed as a sex worker in other work or social and family settings. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, John Scott, Christian Grov, and Victor Minichiello.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","The Routledge Handb. of Male Sex Work, Culture, and Society","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Previous research in the human-human context has shown that stereotypes and prejudice, i.e., negative attitudes, may impair productivity and job satisfaction in teams high in diversity (e.g., regarding age, gender, or ethnicity). Relatedly, in hybrid human-robot teams, robots likely represent an “outgroup” to their human co-workers. The latter may have stereotypes towards robots and may hold negative attitudes towards them. Both aspects might have detrimental effects on subjective and objective performance in human-robot interactions (HRI). In an experiment, we tested the effect of an economic and easy to apply diversity training intervention for use in the work context: The so-called enlightenment approach. This approach utilizes perspective-taking to reduce prejudice and discrimination in human-human contexts. We adapted this intervention to the HRI context and explored its impact on participants’ implicit and explicit robot-related attitudes. However, contrary to our predictions, taking the perspective of a robot resulted in more negative robot-related attitudes, whereas actively suppressing stereotypes about social robots and their characteristics produced positive effects on robot attitudes. Therefore, we recommend considering potential pre-existing aversions against taking the perspective of a robot when designing interventions to improve human-robot collaboration at the workplace. Instead, it might be useful to provide information about existing stereotypes and their consequences, thereby making people aware of their potential biases against social robots.

Supporting preregistered predictions, results from an online study with MTurkers (N = 296) and a laboratory study with college students (N = 275) revealed that men expressed less sense of belonging, positivity toward, and aspirations to participate in HEED (and anticipated more discrimination) than did women when exposed to the reality of antimale gender biases in these domains. However, when told that HEED displays gender equality, men’s engagement matched women’s. Moderated mediation analyses revealed the importance of sense of belonging (and to a lesser extent, anticipated discrimination) in explaining why gender bias leads men to express less HEED positivity and aspirations than women. The current research thus provided novel evidence suggesting that gender bias contributes to men’s underrepresentation in HEED, with important implications for broader occupational gender segregation. © 2022 American Psychological Association","","Gender differences; Gender gap; Gender stereotyping; Heed; Occupational gender segregation","","","","American Psychological Association","","","","","","English","J.

It reveals how phenotype-based racialization generates representations, structures access to resources, and influences processes of socioeconomic mobility. Moreover, the fluidity of systems of racial classification in Latin America leads to phenotype-based discrimination receding in some contexts but resurfacing in others, thereby making it more formidable.

Two protein biomarkers have so far emerged for MD detection, FGF-21 and GDF-15, but the identification of additional biomarkers capable of improving their diagnostic accuracy is highly relevant. Previous studies identified Gelsolin as a regulator of cell survival adaptations triggered by mitochondrial defects. Gelsolin presents a circulating plasma isoform (pGSN), whose altered levels could be a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated the diagnostic performance of pGSN for MD relative to FGF-21 and GDF-15. Using ELISA assays, we quantified plasma levels of pGSN, FGF-21, and GDF-15 in three age-and gender-matched adult cohorts: 60 genetically diagnosed MD patients, 56 healthy donors, and 41 patients with unrelated neuromuscular pathologies (non-MD). Clinical variables and bi-omarkers’ plasma levels were compared between groups. Discrimination ability was calculated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Optimal cut-offs and the following diagnostic parameters were determined: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and efficiency. Comprehensive statistical analyses revealed significant discrimination ability for the three biomarkers to classify between MD and healthy individuals, with the best diagnostic performance for the GDF-15/pGSN combination. pGSN and GDF-15 preferentially discriminated between MD and non-MD patients under 50 years, whereas FGF-21 best classified older subjects. Conclusion: pGSN improves the diagnosis accuracy for MD provided by FGF-21 and GDF-15. © 2021 by the author.

Thus, we aimed to develop and validate a clinical nomogram for predicting OSA in bariatric surgery candidates. Methods: We retrospectively collected the data of 482 bariatric surgery patients between September 2015 and January 2020. Patients were randomly classified into training cohort (n=338) and validation cohort (n=144). The Lasso regression was used to select potentially relevant features; then, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to establish the nomogram. Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were assessed using the C-index, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: The overall prevalence of OSA was 71.0% and higher in males (88.2%) compared to females (60.1%). Of these, 26.1% had mild OSA, 14.9% had moderate OSA, and 44.8% had severe OSA. The nomogram consisted of gender, habitual snoring, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), neck circumference, body mass index (BMI) and age. The nomogram provided favorable discrimination, with a C-indexes for the training and validation cohort of 0.856 (95% CI: 0.816–0.897) and 0.829 (95% CI: 0.76–0.895), respectively, and good calibration. The DCA displayed that the nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion: We established a concise and practical nomogram that could facilitate the preoperative individualized prediction of OSA before bariatric surgery, which may help clinicians select bariatric surgery patients with high-risk OSA for polysomnography (PSG). © 2021 Chen et al.","","Bariatric surgery; Nomogram; Obesity; Obstructive sleep apnea; Predictors","","","","Dove Medical Press Ltd","","","","","","English","Nat.

With a goal towards creating a more equitable and inclusive campus environment, this study aims to center the voices of international students and illuminate the heterogeneity of their perceptions of the campus environment. To this end, we investigated differences in 1681 international students’ perceptions of culturally engaging campus environments by intersections of identity and status. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) examined identity variables (age, race, region, social class, first generation, and disability) and status variables (degree level, field of study, living situation, and visa status) on perceptions of culturally engaging campus environments. Findings indicate that region, visa status, and social class had a significant relationship with perceptions of cultural relevance and responsiveness. The results indicate two-way interactions between living situations and gender identification, as well as degree level and race.

Moreover, facial expressions typically reflect the mixture of people’s emotional statuses, which can be expressed using compound emotions. Compound facial emotion recognition makes the problem even more difficult because the discrimination between dominant and complementary emotions is usually weak. We have created a database that includes 31,250 facial images with different emotions of 115 subjects whose gender distribution is almost uniform to address compound emotion recognition. In addition, we have organized a competition based on the proposed dataset, held at FG workshop 2020. This paper analyzes the winner’s approach—a two-stage recognition method (1st stage, coarse recognition; 2nd stage, fine recognition), which enhances the classification of symmetrical emotion labels. © 2021 by the authors.

Distal metastasis in chondrosarcoma is associated with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to develop and validate columnar maps to predict the risk of distal metastasis in patients with chondrosarcoma, thereby contributing to clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods. Data from chondrosarcoma patients obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2016 were then screened by univariate and multifactorial logistic regressions to construct a predictive distal metastasis risk. The model discrimination of nomogram was assessed by calibration plots, while the predictive accuracy and clinical values were measured by decision curve analysis (DCA). In addition, predictive column line plots were validated in an in-house test set. Results. A total of 1,290 patients were included and randomized in a 7 to 3 ratio into a training group (n = 906) and a test group (n = 384). After logistic regression analysis, the significant variables were gender, tumor pathological grade, laterality, primary tumor stage, regional lymph node metastasis, surgical treatment, and chemotherapy. Calibration curves showed agreement between column line graph predictions and actual observations, while DCA showed the clinical utility of the nomogram. In addition, ROC showed good discrimination and calibration in the training (AUC = 0.937, 95% CI 0.919-0.952) and validation groups (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.877-0.937). Conclusions. The nomogram for distal metastasis risk in patients with chondrosarcoma can effectively predict the individualized risk of distal metastasis and provide clinicians with enlightening information to optimize treatment options. © 2022 Wenle Li et al.","Calibration; Chemotherapy; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Graph theory; Nomograms; Pathology; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Calibration plot; Chondrosarcoma; Clinical diagnosis; Clinical study; Clinical treatments; Column line; Curve analysis; Modeling discrimination; Prediction modelling; Univariate; Tumors","","","","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","English","Secur.

It occurs in both public and private spheres, and manifests itself in visible and hidden ways, contributing to the perpetuation of inequalities between men and women (UNESCO, 2017). The main objective of the present study is to identify and analyse the situations and self-talk associated with self-perceived gender discriminations in everyday life. 141 Primary Education degree students (102 women and 39 men) took part in the study. The influence of different independent variables such as gender, the year in which the degree was undertaken and academic performance were examined in order to determine their influence on social representations of discrimination. The techniques used were the self-identification of situations and emotions, together with the thought listing technique. The lexical analysis of data was carried out using IRaMuTeQ software. Outcomes revealed four types of gender discrimination in both public and private spheres. On the one hand, in the private sphere, subjective perceptions of activities or tasks deemed appropriate for women were reported. On the other hand, in the public sphere, students reported perceiving women to be worse drivers, verbal aggressions and threatening looks towards women in the street, and discriminatory attitudes in the nightlife setting. These topics were identified by participants, regardless of gender, although specific perceptions differed. Findings of the present research highlight the need to influence gender equality training for future teachers in order to build a fairer and more equitable world © This work is under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license","","Gender discrimination; Higher education; Self-talk; Stereotypes","","","","Universidad de Granada","","","","","","English","RELIEVE Rev.

The current study attempts to address a health disparity among Latinx college students by examining the effects of parental permissiveness of underage drinking and perceived ethnic discrimination on drinking outcomes. Methods: Latinx students from three large and geographically diverse public universities (N = 215; 73% female) completed measures during the fall of their first (T1) and second (T2) years. Analyses used moderated regression with bootstrapping to obtain asymmetrical 95% confidence intervals. Parental permissiveness of underage drinking and perceived ethnic discrimination were assessed as predictors at T1. Drinking outcomes were assessed at T2 as typical weekly drinking, peak blood alcohol content (BAC), and alcohol-related consequences. Results: T1 permissiveness was significantly positively associated with T2 peak BAC. T1 discrimination significantly moderated the association between T1 permissiveness and T2 peak BAC as well as T2 consequences. The effects of T1 permissiveness on T2 peak BAC and T2 consequences were stronger among Latinx who experienced above-average levels of T1 discrimination. Conclusions: Results suggest that among Latinx parental permissiveness of underage drinking and perceived ethnic discrimination are risk factors for peak BAC and alcohol-related consequences. The positive associations between parental permissiveness and peak BAC/consequences were stronger among Latinx students who experienced high levels of ethnic discrimination. Efforts to address these risk factors in future culturally sensitive parent-based interventions for Latinx college students are warranted. © 2021","Alcohol Drinking; Alcohol Drinking in College; Female; Humans; Male; Parenting; Parents; Permissiveness; Risk Factors; Students; Universities; alcohol; adult; alcohol blood level; Article; bootstrapping; college student; controlled study; cultural anthropology; drinking behavior; female; gender; geography; health disparity; Hispanic; human; male; outcome assessment; parental attitude; parental permissiveness; personal experience; prediction; questionnaire; racism; regression analysis; risk factor; self concept; underage drinking; university; young adult; Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire; attitude; child parent relation; college drinking; drinking behavior; epidemiology; risk factor; student","College student drinking; Discrimination; Latinx; Parental permissiveness of drinking","","alcohol, 64-17-5","National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (T32 DA017629); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, (R01AA12529)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Addict.

Fox, who had gender reassignment surgery in 2006, has been a source of controversy since being forced to ‘come out’ as a transgender athlete. While some fellow MMA fighters support her right to fight as a woman, other fighters and some sports commentators have decried her participation in the sport, effectively calling for transgender discrimination. At the nexus of ethics and law, transgender athletes face uncertainty, aversion, and hostility in their efforts to compete. This chapter examines the place of transgender athletes in MMA, with a focus on Fallon Fox as a case study in gender identity and the ethics of transgender athletic participation. As the sports world comes to grips with the question of nonbinary gender classification, this is a timely, focused examination of a crucial ethical question facing athletes in MMA and beyond. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Jason Holt and Marc Ramsay.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","The Philosophy of Mixed Martial Arts: Squaring the Octagon","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

This study uses the data of 400 men and women randomly sampled coffee farmers from a developing country, Tanzania, to evaluate coffee income distribution, and how general coffee production and trade contribute to gender equity and livelihood improvement. Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition and Gini coefficient models are used for data analysis. We find a gender imbalance from the ownership and control of resources to the participation of men and women in the coffee supply chain. However, investing in supporting the coffee supply chain has an impact on livelihood improvement, due to coffee income inequality reducing effects. There is a gender gap in the income earned from coffee production and trading, which is 44% of the women’s structural disadvantages. Empowerment for equal access to land and credit, and offering trade facilitation services will bridge the existing gender gap. Additionally, developing and disseminating new coffee production technologies that will reduce discrimination, by offering new opportunities and making coffee an inclusive supply chain, remains imperative. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to (re)think the function of law as an instrument not only of power, but as an element of social transformation, we promote here a reflection on aspects raised by these theories; among others, the same notion of power, oppression, intersectionality or decoloniality. These categories are relevant to examine how law regulates the experiences of discrimination of specific social groups, highlighting the intimate relationship between the social contexts, the premises and the legal answers. To do so, we examine in particular how asylum law responds to claims grounded on sexual orientation and gender identity. Finally, this reasoning suggests a conception of law oriented to action and the social change. © 2020 Age of Human Rights Journal.

The investigation is performed by recording electroencephalography (EEG) signal from 20 subjects that stimulated by displaying images of shoes. In the algorithm, the EEG signals were denoised by using artifact subspace reconstruction and independent component analysis methods. The Wavelet technique is then applied to attain five EEG frequency bands and, subsequently linear and nonlinear features were extracted. The extracted features includes linear features, namely the power spectral density and energy of wavelet; and nonlinear features, namely the fractal dimension, entropy, and trajectory volume behavior quantifiers. The meaningfulness of the features for identifying discriminative channels as well as frequency bands is considered by means of Wilcoxon Rank Sum statistical test. The identifications of Like/Dislike conditions were then facilitated by the Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. Results illustrated that higher frequency bands, the combination of theta, alpha, and beta, in Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8, Cz, and Pz regions was observed for female group. The most distinctive feature and classifier for the female group was the energy of the wavelet coefficient and RF classifier, respectively, that produced the highest accuracy rate of 71.51± 5.1%. In addition, the most distinctive features for males were sample and approximate entropy, as well as the Higuchi fractal dimension that with the RF classifier produced an accuracy rate of 71.33± 14.07%.

We tested this prediction and the consequences of labeling for work attitudes and performance using an experiment that assigned parents to a low-status position in a work group, varying whether the decision invoked biased, ideological assumptions about parenthood. As expected, ideology drove mothers' (but not fathers’) labeling. Mothers were less likely to label biased treatment against them as discriminatory when they were conservative and when they subscribed to separate spheres and ideal worker ideologies. Mothers who labeled their treatment as discriminatory had more negative work attitudes than those who did not, but also tended to appeal the decision.

The tasks focused on the word level and involved a phoneme identification task, a discrimination task, and a word dictation task. The participants were 130 students at public and private universities in Greek-speaking Cyprus, exposed to L2 English as the language of instruction. Overall, the findings indicate a task effect. Word length is also a significant factor for speech perception based on the findings. Moreover, the results of the study indicated difficulties with word frequency. According to the item analysis, low-frequency words are more difficult to perceive, especially with respect to consonants in the word dictation task. This could be attributed to the acoustic-orthography interface in L2 phonology. Age, gender, as well as years of L2 instruction and use, are statistically significant factors for speech perception. The overall pattern trend is in line with the Native Language Magnet Model (NLM; Kuhl 2000), suggesting that non-native contrasts may be difficult to discriminate when the prototype of an L1 category closely resembles two L2 phones. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","","Consonants; L2 speech perception; Task effect; Vowels; Word frequency; Word length","","","","De Gruyter","","","","","","English","Second Lang.

The main goal of this study is to identify acoustic features that support the diagnosis of PD while being independent of the language of a speaker. We recorded seven speech (e.g. monologue) and voice (e.g. sustained phonation) tasks in a cohort of 59 PD patients and 44 age-and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) speaking Czech or US English. A non-parametric test revealed that the best discrimination power has a measure quantifying the number of interword pauses per minute. In a consequent classification analysis, utilising logistic regression, we observed a drop in the classification accuracy from 72-73% to 67%, when moving from single-language modelling to the multilingual one. The results of this study suggest that especially the prosodic (pause-based) features could play a significant role in the automatic language-independent diagnosis of PD. © 2021 IEEE.","Diagnosis; Modeling languages; Speech; Speech recognition; Acoustic analysis; Acoustic features; Dysarthria; Healthy controls; Hypokinetic dysarthria; Multilingual analysis; Nonparametric tests; Parkinson's disease; Speech disorders; Voice disorders; Neurodegenerative diseases","acoustic analysis; classification; hypokinetic dysarthria; Parkinson's disease","","","Marie Skłodowska-Curie, (734718, NU20-04-00294); RVO, (65269705); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Ministerstvo Zdravotnictví Ceské Republiky, MZCR","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","44th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing, TSP 2021","171532","Virtual, Brno","26 July 2021 through 28 July 2021","","English","Int.

If biases are not interpreted and solved, algorithms might reinforce societal discrimination and injustices. It is also not clear how to measure fairness in algorithms. In biometrics disciplines such as automatic facial recognition, examining images pertaining to male subjects has been proven does not yield the same error rates as when examining images from female subjects. Furthermore, recent studies found that automatic fingerprint match scores vary based on an individual’s age and gender. Although ROC curve has been essential for assessing classification performance, the presence of covariates can affect the discriminatory capacity. It might be advisable to incorporate these covariates in the ROC curve to exploit the additional information that they provide. More importantly, the ROC regression modeling discussed in the paper can handle both continuous covariates such as age and discrete covariates such as gender and race. The resulting adjusted ROC curve provides error rates which account for demographic information pertaining to each subject. Thus, a better measure of the discriminatory capacity is generated compared to the pooled ROC curve. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Errors; Face recognition; Forensic science; Population statistics; Automated tools; Classification performance; Demographic information; Error rate; Facial recognition; Match score; Regression model; ROC curves; Computer vision","","","","National Institute of Justice, NIJ, (2019-DU-BX-0011); Michigan State University, MSU","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","5th International Conference on Computer Vision and Image Processing, CVIP 2020","256959","Prayagraj","4 December 2020 through 6 December 2020","","English","Commun.

The article draws on ethnographic material consisting of in-depth interviews, focus groups, participant observation and media analysis. The article concludes that the growing feminist scholarship on intersectionality which originated in the United States needs to go beyond the factors of race, class and gender, to include age, marital status and party identification particularly when considering the experiences of women of colour in the global South as reflected in the case of Zimbabwe. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although such models have been developed to try to reduce human bias and thus bring greater fairness to financial services decisions, studies have found that there is still significant discrimination by both face-To-face and algorithmic lenders. In fact, Apple has recently been investigated for gender discrimination in assigning a credit limit to its users, demonstrating that there may still be inherent biases in the development of such algorithms and models. Furthermore, biases in financial services models may not only lead to unfair discrimination but were also linked to health problems and recovery prospects. This project aims to analyse and identify the different types of biases found in AI models and data used in the financial services industry. We propose a method using data analysis and explainable models to explain how these biases emerge throughout the process of developing AI models as well as applying state-of-The-Art bias dealing techniques to avoid and mitigate them. Finally, we propose how to evaluate these models according to the business objectives and consider possible trade-offs between different definitions of fairness. Thus, the main questions that this project will try to answer are as follows:-What are the current biases in credit risk and fraud detection models and how to identify them?-In what ways understanding how biases emerge from the data can help us in bias mitigation?-To what extent could credit risk and fraud detection models bias be mitigated, and what are the implications of those mitigation techniques? Answering these questions, we hope to create a pipeline for building these models by understanding the key points where bias can emerge and the appropriate methods to avoid it.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","Crime; Economic and social effects; Finance; Risk assessment; Bias; Credit risks; Credit scoring; Detection models; Fairness; Financial service; Fraud detection; Intelligence models; Machine-learning; Risk detections; Machine learning","bias; fairness; financial services; machine learning","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","5th AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society, AIES 2022","181805","Oxford","1 August 2022 through 3 August 2022","AAAI; ACM SIGAI","English","AIES - Proc.

Yet, most algorithms deployed in the healthcare context do not consider these aspects and do not account for bias detection. Missing these dimensions in algorithms used in medicine is a huge point of concern, as neglecting these aspects will inevitably produce far from optimal results and generate errors that may lead to misdiagnosis and potential discrimination. This paper explores how current algorithmic-based systems may reinforce gender biases and affect marginalized communities in healthcare-related applications. To do so, we bring together notions and reflections from computer science, queer media studies, and legal insights to better understand the magnitude of failing to consider gender and sex difference in the use of algorithms for medical purposes. Our goal is to illustrate the potential impact that algorithmic bias may have on inadvertent discriminatory, safety, and privacy-related concerns for patients in increasingly automated medicine. This is necessary because by rushing the deployment of AI technologies that do not account for diversity, we risk having an even more unsafe and inadequate healthcare delivery. By promoting the account for privacy, safety, diversity, and inclusion in algorithmic developments with health-related outcomes, we ultimately aim to inform the Artificial Intelligence (AI) global governance landscape and practice on the importance of integrating gender and sex considerations in the development of algorithms to avoid exacerbating existing or new prejudices. © 2022 Eduard Fosch-Villaronga, Hadassah Drukarch, Pranav Khanna, Tessa Verhoef, Bart Custers","Health care; Inclusions; Safety engineering; 'current; Algorithmics; Artificial intelligence governance; Bias; Discrimination; Diversity; Gender; Gender bias; Gender-differences; Optimal results; Artificial intelligence","AI governance; Artificial intelligence; Bias; Discrimination; Diversity; Gender; Inclusion; Medicine","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Stanford University, SU; European Commission, EC","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Comput Law Secur.

Design/Methodology/Approach: We analyze data from semistructured interviews with a diverse sample of 35 transgender-identified adults. Based on thematic narrative analysis, we explore four themes in relation to embodiment: discrimination; discomfort and hyperawareness of genitalia; strategic reframing and active management; and SSCS health care encounters as positive and gender affirming. Findings: In relation to SSCS, transgender individuals experience discrimination, do emotion work, and actively manage situations to obtain needed health care, and sometimes forego care because barriers are insurmountable. Health care providers’ responses to transgender embodiment can disrupt health care encounters, but they can also facilitate access and create opportunities for affirmation, agency, advocacy, and new forms of interaction. Embodiment-and gender-affirming interactions with health care providers, which varied by gender, emerged as key influences on participants’ experiences of SSCS. Research Limitations/Implications: Our sample primarily includes binary gender-identified individuals, and while our interview guide covered many topics, the SSCS question did not explicitly reference testicular exams. Practical Implications: Cancer prevention and detection Cancer prevention and detection require health care professionals who are prepared for differently embodied persons. Preventive cancer screenings are not “sex-specific”; they are relevant to individuals with medically necessary needs regardless of gender identity or embodiment. Social Implications Originality/Value: Few medical sociologists have focused on transgender embodiment. Findings enhance our understanding of how transgender embodiment and minority stress processes influence access to needed SSCS. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","adult; cancer prevention; cancer screening; clinical article; emotion; female; gender identity; genital system; health care personnel; human; human tissue; male; narrative; Papanicolaou test; physiological stress; semi structured interview; sociologist; transgender","Cancer screening; Discrimination; Embodiment; Health care; Minority stress; Transgender","","","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","English","Adv.

Age, gender, and comorbidities are known to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are generally considered independently without accurate knowledge of the magnitude of their effect on risk, potentially resulting in incorrect risk estimation. There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC = 0.786; 95% confidence interval = 0.763 to 0.808) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC = 0.635; 95% confidence interval = 0.607 to 0.662). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors–not age and gender–that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone (or only clinical factors) to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prediction model for the individual risk for suicide after the diagnosis of lung cancer. Methods: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer between 2007 and 2016 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify relevant predictors and construct prediction models. Additionally, graphic visualization methods were used to predict the risk for suicide within 5 years after the diagnosis of lung cancer. We used bootstrapping for the internal validation, Harrell's C-index for the discrimination, and a calibration plot for the calibration of the proposed model. Results: We obtained complete information on 112372 patients diagnosed with lung cancer from the SEER cohort. Multivariate Cox regression identified sex, race, marital status, tumour grade, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as significant predictors for suicide. A nomogram and a risk matrix were developed to visualize the risk for suicide within 5 years after lung cancer diagnosis. The bootstrapped and validated C-indices of the nomogram were 0.77 and 0.78, respectively. The calibration plot indicated good agreement between the prediction and actual observation. Conclusions: The proposed model demonstrated good discrimination and calibration performance for predicting the risk for suicide within 5 years after lung cancer diagnosis. Reliable and feasible risk assessment tools can be promising for preventing unnecessary suicides among lung cancer patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Nomograms; Prognosis; SEER Program; Suicide; antineoplastic agent; adenosquamous carcinoma; aged; Article; calibration; cancer grading; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; carcinoid; chemoradiotherapy; cohort analysis; female; gender; human; large cell carcinoma; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; marriage; mortality; nomogram; non small cell lung cancer; predictor variable; race; reliability; risk assessment; small cell lung cancer; squamous cell lung carcinoma; suicide; cancer registry; lung tumor; prognosis","Lung cancer; Nomogram; Prediction; Risk assessment; Suicide","","","Academic Promotion Programme of Shandong First Medical University, (2019LJ005, 2019QL013); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71804093, 81903410)","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","J.

The goal of this study was to apply social-ecological and minority stress frameworks to identify individual and interpersonal-level TGD-specific STB risk and protective factors. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the 2015 United States Transgender Health Survey, a comprehensive cross-sectional health assessment of a national sample of TGD adults (N = 27,658). Chi-square and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to identify bivariate correlates of 12-month and lifetime suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA). Logistic regression was employed to identify the strongest STB risk and protective factors across levels. Results: Sexual minority identification, racial minority identification, and having a disability were lifetime STB risk factors. TGD identity, sexual minority identification, racial minority identification (SA only), lower education, lower income, military experience, having a disability, and being uninsured were 12-month STB risk factors. Psychological distress was the most robust STB risk factor. Workplace discrimination, family rejection, healthcare discrimination, and childhood bias-based victimization were lifetime STB risk factors. All forms of discrimination and victimization (with the exception of family rejection for SI) were 12-month STB risk factors. Family and coworker support were protective factors for lifetime SA (but not SI) and all 12-month STBs. Being less out about TGD identity was a protective factor for STBs (except for 12-month SI). Conclusion: Findings support social-ecological and minority stress STB risk frameworks. Recommendations are provided for a comprehensive approach to TGD suicide prevention. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adult; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic and Racial Minorities; Gender Identity; Humans; Suicidal Ideation; Transgender Persons; United States; adult; child; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; gender identity; human; suicidal ideation; transgender; United States","Discrimination; Gender identity; Social support; Social-ecological model; Suicide; Transgender","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","English","Soc.

Within organizational communication, the effectiveness of interpersonal communication plays an important role for the functioning and productivity of any company. Interpersonal communication is not constituted only by verbal, oral and / or written communication, but also by non-verbal communication, whose importance for communicational effectiveness is fully demonstrated in the literature. In the organizational and work context of any organization, non-verbal communication is fundamental in interpersonal communication and in the management of interpersonal and human relations, denouncing hierarchies, social statutes, behaviours, indicating who is in charge and who is obeying. In this follow-up of ideas, the present exploratory study discusses the impact that non-verbal communication has on the organization and its importance for the identification of cases of sexual harassment. After a review of the literature on the importance of non-verbal communication in interpersonal and organizational communication and on the importance of non-verbal communication for the perception of cases of sexual harassment, we sought to inquire about the perception of individuals on the importance of non-verbal communication as an indication of sexual harassment in organizations. Thus, the objective of this study is to demonstrate that non-verbal signals / non-verbal communication is a variable to be taken into account for detecting situations of sexual harassment in organizations. In order to achieve this objective, a questionnaire was applied to 100 individuals employed in the northern region of Portugal in order to ascertain their opinion on: whether gender differences still happen today; identify which gender suffers the most discrimination in the workplace; whether gender is important for harassment; and to ascertain to what extent the organizational communication of companies is linked to the occurrence of sexual harassment situations. The results obtained point to a correlation between non-verbal communication and situations of harassment, as non-verbal communication can give evidence of the existence of victims of sexual harassment, but it can also be used as a means of sexual harassment. Similarly, at the organizational level, non-verbal communication is closely correlated with the identification of cases of sexual harassment. © The Authors, 2021.

Being dominated by male users, game developers, game players, game investors, the non-inclusiveness and gender inequality reside as salient problems in the community. In the online gaming communities, most women players report toxic and offensive language or experiences of verbal abuse. Symbolic interactionists and feminists assume that words matter since the use of particular language and terms can dehumanize and harm particular groups such as women. Identifying and reporting the toxic behavior, sexism, and harassment that occur in online games is a critical need in preventing cyberbullying, and it will help gender diversity and equality grow in the online gaming industry. However, the research on this topic is still rare, except for some milestone studies. This paper aims to contribute to the theory and practice of sexist toxic language detection in the online gaming community, through the automatic detection and analysis of toxic comments in online games chat logs. We adopted the MaXQDA tool as a data visualization technique to reveal the most frequently used toxic words used against women in online gaming communities. We also applied the Naïve Bayes Classifier for text mining to classify if a chat log content is sexist and toxic. We also refined the text mining model Laplace estimator and re-tested the model’s accuracy. The study also revealed that the accuracy of the Naïve Bayes Classifier did not change by the Laplace estimator. The findings of the study are expected to raise awareness about the use of gender-based toxic language in the online gaming community. Moreover, the proposed mining model can inspire similar research on practical tools to help moderate the use of sexist toxic language and disinfect these communities from gender-based discrimination and sexist bullying. © 2022.

A meme is essentially an image characterized by pictorial content with an overlaying text a posteriori introduced by humans, with the main goal of being funny and/or ironic. Although most of them are created with the intent of making funny jokes, in a short time people started to use them as a form of hate and prejudice against women, landing to sexist and aggressive messages in online environments that subsequently amplify the sexual stereotyping and gender inequality of the offline world.

In this regard, Machine Learning (ML) classifiers have shown great efficiency in discriminating falls and conventional movements or Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) based on the analysis of the signals captured by transportable inertial sensors. Due to the intrinsic difficulties of training and testing this type of detectors in realistic scenarios and with their target audience (older adults), FDSs are normally benchmarked against a predefined set of ADLs and emulated falls executed by volunteers in a controlled environment. In most studies, however, samples from the same experimental subjects are used to both train and evaluate the FDSs. In this work, we investigate the performance of ML-based FDS systems when the test subjects have physical characteristics (weight, height, body mass index, age, gender) different from those of the users considered for the test phase. The results seem to point out that certain divergences (weight, height) of the users of both subsets (training ad test) may hamper the effectiveness of the classifiers (a reduction of up 20% in sensitivity and of up to 5% in specificity is reported). However, it is shown that the typology of the activities included in these subgroups has much greater relevance for the discrimination capability of the classifiers (with specificity losses of up to 95% if the activity types for training and testing strongly diverge). © 2021, The Author(s).","Accidental Falls; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Biomedical Engineering; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Movement; Wearable Electronic Devices; Young Adult; adult; aged; ambulatory monitoring; biomedical engineering; daily life activity; devices; electronic device; falling; female; human; machine learning; male; middle aged; movement (physiology); prevention and control; young adult","","","","Andalusian Regional Government, (P18-RT-1652); Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucia Tech; International Dragonfly Fund, IDF, (UMA18-FEDERJA-022); Universidad de Málaga, UMA, (And, Campus de Excelencia Internacional, alucia Tech)","Nature Research","","","","","","English","Sci.

Previous studies highlighted the role of palm print in sex identification, however, these studies were little when compared to fingerprints . AIM: To estimate the density of palm print ridges and to make an equation for establishing gender using gender parameters for a specific population (Egyptians) . MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 200 healthy young adults (113 males and 87 males, aged 18–22 years) from Cairo city, Egypt . The palm prints were taken by inking method and four areas of the palm print were analyzed to count the ridge density of each palm print area . RESULTS: Females describe higher ridge density than males in all palm areas with a significant high statistical difference (p <0 .001) for all areas of both hands . The areas of highest sexual discriminatory power for the right palm was Palmar area 4 (P4) and for the left palm was Palmar area 1 (P1) and sex could be accurately identified at an accuracy of 70% . In addition, there was a significant correlation for ridge density in each palm area and other palm areas .

In this research, we test this hypothesis in two domains (academic: Study 1 [N = 107 Spanish high schoolers]; work: Study 2 [N = 164 Spanish university students]. We examine the underlying process that leads women and men to feel ostracized and less motivated when sexist language is used. Results show that the use of sexist language has a negative impact on feelings of ostracism and motivation for both women and men. This can be explained by various motivational processes: intrapersonal (identification with the task or the job), interpersonal (feelings of belonging) and intergroup (perceived discrimination). We find no impact of participants’ gender on these effects, although girls show more negative attitudes than boys towards exclusive language. Moreover, the use of gender-fair language reduces negative emotions in participants reporting low levels of neosexism compared to when sexist language is used (Study 2). Overall, these results suggest that changing language practices might have positive motivational implications for both genders. © 2021 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.","","belonging; language; motivation; ostracism; sexism","","","AEI/FEDER; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología, MICYT","Routledge","","","","","","English","Rev.

This study was designed to address the needs of a non-for-profit organisation to reach out to the young unemployed individuals in Italy with educational and job opportunities via communication channels that are more likely to appeal to younger generations. To this extend, we developed an ad-hoc Facebook application which administers questionnaires while gathering data about the Likes on Facebook Pages. Then, we developed a machine learning framework that successfully predicts the unemployment status of an unseen individual (.74 AUC). However, blindly delegating to the machine learning model the communication intervention may lead to digital discrimination on the basis of socio-demographic characteristics. Here, we propose a framework that aims to optimising both for the prediction performance as well as the most adequate fairness metric. Our framework is based on an adaptive threshold for gender, while we show that it can be expanded for other socio-demographic attributes and generalised for other interventions of assistive character. We present a doubly cross-validated setting that achieves out-of-sample stability and generalisability of results. We compare the behaviour of models that infer on different sets of data and provide an indepth discussion on the most predictive features, demonstrating that the “fairness through unawareness” approach does not suffice to achieve a fair classification since sensitive demographic information can be inferred not only via other sociodemographic attributes but also from behavioural digital patterns. Finally, we thoroughly assess the behaviour of the adaptive threshold approach and provide an in-depth discussion on the advantages but also the implications of such models offering actionable insights. Our results show that careful assessment of fairness metrics should be considered, primarily when AI models are employed for policymaking. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cost effectiveness; E-learning; Employment; Machine learning; Population statistics; Social networking (online); Surveys; Adaptive thresholds; Assistive; Data for social good; Digital discrimination; Fairness; Machine-learning; Policy makers; Social media; Sociodemographics; Unemployment; Classification (of information)","Data for social good; Digital discrimination; Fairness; Machine learning; Social Media; Unemployment","","","Fondazione CRT; Institute for Scientific Interchange, ISI","Springer","","","","","","English","Data Min.

The primary motivation for this work is to evaluate how deepfake detection model behaves under such anomalies. However, due to the black-box nature of deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is hard to predict the performance of a model when the input data is modified. Crucially, if this defect is not addressed properly, it will adversely affect the fairness of the model and result in discrimination of certain sub-population unintentionally. Therefore, the objective of this work is to adopt metamorphic testing to examine the reliability of the selected deepfake detection model, and how the transformation of input variation places influence on the output. We have chosen MesoInception-4, a state-of-the-art deepfake detection model, as the target model and makeup as the anomalies. Makeups are applied through utilizing the Dlib library to obtain the 68 facial landmarks prior to filling in the RGB values. Metamorphic relations are derived based on the notion that realistic perturbations of the input images, such as makeup, involving eyeliners, eye shadows, blushes, and lipsticks (which are common cosmetic appearance) applied to male and female images, should not alter the output of the model by a huge margin. Furthermore, we narrow down the scope to focus on revealing potential gender biases in DL and AI systems. Specifically, we are interested to examine whether MesoInception-4 model produces unfair decisions, which should be considered as a consequence of robustness issues. The findings from our work have the potential to pave the way for new research directions in the quality assurance and fairness in DL and AI systems.  © 2022 ACM.","Deep learning; Artificial intelligence systems; Black boxes; Detection models; Fairness evaluation; Fairness testing; Input datas; Metamorphic testing; Oracle problem; Performance; Robustness testing; Quality assurance","fairness testing; Metamorphic testing; oracle problem; robustness testing","","","Monash University Malaysia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","7th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing, MET 2022","181076","Pittsburgh","9 May 2022","","English","Proc. - Int.

Gender marker choice has become more com plex with increasing availability of a gender-neutral “X” marker. Yet, little research has characterized trans persons’ perspectives on legal gender affirmation, and its mental health impacts.Methods: Here we present qualitative research exploring trans individuals’ goals for and barriers from seeking gender-affirming legal care and perspectives on the “X” gender marker. We conducted one-hour semi-structured interviews with 54 trans persons in the U.S. and Canada.Results: Almost all participants were interested in legal name (had: 54%, want: 33%) and gender marker (had: 46%, want: 46%) changes. Most common barriers included: logistics, fearing violence/discrimination, cost, and legality; 24% reported only updating some identification documents. While some sought an “X” gender marker (had: 11%, want: 19%), 32% considered the “X” harmful, fearing lack of compatibility with other documents and increasing risk of gender-based violence/discrimination. Most reported anxiety and isolation from concerns over mismatched or inaccurate identification documents.Conclusions: This work offers insight into how legal gender affirmation influences mental health for trans persons, highlighting the importance of mental health providers exploring legal gender affirmation when treating members of the trans community. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","gender affirmation; legal; LGBTQ; mental health; Non-binary","","","","Routledge","","","","","","English","J.

Background: CID is a high-stakes decision-making task involving discrimination between friendly and enemy forces. Literature on CID is primarily focused on the individual, but the extensive use of teams in the military means that more team-based research is needed in this area. Method: After a set of training sessions, 39 dyads were tasked with identifying 10 armored vehicles in a series of pictures and videos. Team communication was recorded, transcribed, and coded for instances of disagreements. Results: Analyses indicated that males scored higher on a spatial visualization measure than did females. M-M teams performed significantly better than M-F teams on the CID task, but when spatial ability and team disagreements were added as predictors, the effect of team gender composition became nonsignificant. Spatial ability and team disagreement were significant predictors of team CID performance. Conclusion: Results suggest that spatial skills and team disagreement behaviors are more important for team CID performance than a team’s gender composition. To our knowledge, this is the first lab study of team CID. Application: This research highlights the importance of understanding both individual differences (e.g., spatial skills) and team processes (e.g., communication) within CID training environments in the military context. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Communication; Female; Humans; Male; Military Personnel; Patient Care Team; Spatial Navigation; Armored vehicles; Decision making; Military vehicles; Personnel training; Visualization; Combat identification; Communication analysis; gender; Individual Differences; Spatial abilities; Spatial visualization; Team communication; teams and groups; adult; army; article; female; genetic transcription; human; male; sex ratio; skill; videorecording; interpersonal communication; military personnel; patient care; spatial orientation; Spatial variables measurement","communication analysis; gender; team communication; teams and groups; training","","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Hum.

However, using historic data is a very tricky job which can quite easily propagate discrimination in a very efficient way. Thus, this work is aimed to analyse data from legal proceedings looking for evidence related to the occurrence of bias in the judges' decision-making process, considering mainly the gender or social condition of the convicts. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, preceded by data analysis and processing procedures, were used to explain and find explicit data behaviour.

Given the importance of minimizing DIF items in test construction, teachers or testing practitioners need more information regarding possible associates of DIF items. Using an example of a teacher-made mathematics achievement test, this study aimed to examine how the Poly-BW indices (power, defenselessness, disturbance, and hint) contributed to the properties of gender-related DIF items. Data from a 34-item mathematics achievement test that involved 1,439 seventh-grade students from Taiwan (51.01% boys and 48.99% girls) showed that the differences of the defenselessness (mp) and power (cp) indices between men and women served as salient predictors of the DIF measures estimated by the Poly Simultaneous Item Bias Test (Poly-SIBTEST) procedure and with satisfactory accuracy of hit rates. Items with relatively large defenselessness for men were likely to present male-favoring DIFs, whereas items with relatively large power for men were likely to present female-favoring DIFs. The Poly-BW indices yielded directions for modifying items for teachers in practice.

Method: A total of 104, 5-to 9-year-old CI recipients completed tests of segmental perception (e.g., word recognition in quiet and noise, recognition of vowels and consonants in quiet), suprasegmental perception (e.g., talker and stress discrimination, nonword stress repetition, and emotion identification), and nonverbal intelligence. Two years later, participants completed standardized tests of reading decoding and comprehension. Using regression analyses, the unique contribution of suprasegmental perception to reading skills was determined after controlling for demographic characteristics and segmental perception performance. Results: Standardized reading scores of the CI recipients increased with nonverbal intelligence for both decoding and comprehension. Female gender was associated with higher comprehension scores. After controlling for gender and nonverbal intelligence, segmental perception accounted for approximately 4% and 2% of the variance in decoding and comprehension, respectively. After controlling for nonverbal intelligence, gender, and segmental perception, suprasegmental perception accounted for an extra 4% and 7% unique variance in reading decoding and reading comprehension, respectively. Conclusions: Suprasegmental perception operates independently from segmental perception to facilitate good reading outcomes for these children with CIs. Clinicians and educators should be mindful that early perceptual skills may have longterm benefits for literacy.

We aimed to study the association between gender dysphoria-related diagnostic coding and hospital admission for suicidality or self-harm in a large representative pediatric inpatient database from the USA. Methods: Using the 2016 and 2019 Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID), we identified transgender and non-binary young people (aged 6–20 years) with International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes related to gender dysphoria. We identified suicidal ideation using explicit suicidality ICD-10 codes, and self-harm using 355 self-harm ICD-10 codes. Prevalence of suicidality (primary outcome), self-harm, and the combination of suicidality and self-harm (secondary outcomes) was compared between young people with and without gender dysphoria-related codes. Univariable and multivariable regression was used to test for an association between gender dysphoria and suicidality, self-harm, or suicidality and self-harm combined. Findings: 1 090 544 individuals were included from KID 2016 and 1 026 752 from KID 2019. Gender dysphoria-related diagnoses were prevalent in 161 per 100 000 hospital admissions in KID 2016 and 475 per 100 000 hospital admissions in KID 2019. In KID 2016 and KID 2019, among individuals who were White, privately insured, or from higher median income ZIP code areas, proportionately more had gender dysphoria-related codes. Prevalence of suicidality was greater in individuals with gender dysphoria-related codes than in individuals without gender dysphoria-related codes in KID 2016 (635 [36%] of 1755 individuals with gender dysphoria-related codes vs 55 351 [5%] of 1 088 789 individuals without gender dysphoria-related codes; unadjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 7·19 [95% CI 6·75–7·66]) and KID 2019 (2680 [55%] of 4872 individuals with gender dysphoria-related codes vs 38 831 [4%] of 1 021 880 individuals without gender dysphoria-related codes; unadjusted PR 5·45 [5·30–5·60]). This association persisted in multivariable modelling adjusting for confounders in KID 2016 (adjusted PR 5·02 [95% CI 4·67–5·41]) and KID 2019 (4·14 [4·02–4·28]). Increased unadjusted and adjusted PRs for individuals with gender dysphoria-related codes, relative to those without, were also evident for self-harm and when combining suicidality and self-harm in both the 2016 and 2019 datasets. Interpretation: In a large representative national sample, transgender and non-binary young people with gender dysphoria-related diagnoses were frequently admitted to hospital for suicidality or self-harm. The lower rates of gender-dysphoria-related codes among young people who were non-White, publicly insured, and from low-income households suggest that underlying inequities might shape the identification and management of gender dysphoria. Structural and health-care provider-level interventions are needed to reduce discrimination and expand gender-affirming competencies to prevent adverse outcomes for hospitalised transgender and non-binary young people with gender dysphoria.

This paper proposes a new Lexicographic multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Fair Feature Selection (LGAFFS). LGAFFS selects a subset of relevant features which is optimised for a given classification algorithm, by simultaneously optimising one measure of accuracy and four measures of fairness. This is achieved by using a lexicographic multi-objective optimisation approach where the objective of optimising accuracy has higher priority over the objective of optimising the four fairness measures. LGAFFS was used to select features in a pre-processing phase for a random forest algorithm. The experiments compared LGAFFS’ performance against two feature selection approaches: (a) the baseline approach of letting the random forest algorithm use all features, i.e. no feature selection in a pre-processing phase; and (b) a Sequential Forward Selection method. The results showed that LGAFFS significantly improved fairness measures in several cases, with no significant difference regarding predictive accuracy, across all experiments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Classification algorithm; Fairness measures; Features selection; Multi-objectives genetic algorithms; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization approach; Pre-processing; Random forest algorithm; Relevant features; Sub-groups; Feature Selection","","","","Leverhulme Trust, (RPG-2020-145)","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","17th International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, PPSN 2022","281919","Dortmund","10 September 2022 through 14 September 2022","","English","Lect.

Timely detection of balance impairment can help identify the elderly prone to falls and also trigger early interventions to prevent them. The goal of this study was to develop a surrogate approach for assessing elderly’s functional balance based on Short Form Berg Balance Scale (SFBBS) score. Methods: Data were collected from a waist-mounted tri-axial accelerometer while participants performed a timed up and go test. Clinically relevant variables were extracted from the segmented accelerometer signals for fitting SFBBS predictive models. Regularized regression together with random-shuffle-split cross-validation was used to facilitate the development of the predictive models for automatic balance estimation. Results: Eighty-five community-dwelling older adults (72.12 ± 6.99 year) participated in our study. Our results demonstrated that combined clinical and sensor-based variables, together with regularized regression and cross-validation, achieved moderate-high predictive accuracy of SFBBS scores (mean MAE = 2.01 and mean RMSE = 2.55). Step length, gender, gait speed and linear acceleration variables describe the motor coordination were identified as significantly contributed variables of balance estimation. The predictive model also showed moderate-high discriminations in classifying the risk levels in the performance of three balance assessment motions in terms of AUC values of 0.72, 0.79 and 0.76 respectively. Conclusions: The study presented a feasible option for quantitatively accurate, objectively measured, and unobtrusively collected functional balance assessment at the point-of-care or home environment. It also provided clinicians and elderly with stable and sensitive biomarkers for long-term monitoring of functional balance. © 2021, The Author(s).","Accelerometry; Accidental Falls; Aged; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Postural Balance; Time and Motion Studies; Wearable Electronic Devices; accelerometry; aged; body equilibrium; electronic device; falling; geriatric assessment; human; prevention and control; task performance","Balance and mobility; Data mining; Elderly care; Fall; Sensor; Timed up and go","","","CityU Provost Project, (9610406); Yale Program on Aging/Claude D.

Design: Using data from the 1995 Detroit Area Study, logistic and negative binomial regression models were used to assess the association between timing of initial exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination, classified as early childhood (0-7), childhood (8-12), adolescence (13-19), and adulthood (>19), on physician-diagnosed cardiovascular health conditions during adulthood. Each analysis adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, marital status, health-related behaviors, and pre-existing health conditions. Results: Of the 1,106 participants in the final sample, 520 identified as White and 586 identified as Black. Over half (64%) of the sample experienced at least one major cardiovascular health event at the time of the study, with 39% reporting two or more events. Results from logistic regression models showed that initial exposure to racial discrimination during early childhood was associated with a 2.96 (95%CI:1.15, 7.83) times greater odds of having any cardiovascular-related health condition later in life compared to individuals who reported no discrimination. Results from negative binomial regression models demonstrated that individuals who reported initial exposure to racial discrimination during early childhood and adolescence had a CVD incidence rate that was 1.63 (95%CI:1.11, 2.38) and 1.37 (95%CI:1.10, 1.69) times higher than individuals who reported no discrimination. Conclusion: Initial exposure to racial discrimination in early childhood and adolescence may increase the risk of cardiovascular conditions later in life.

This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study explored the risk factors of alexithymia in older adults living in nursing homes with chronic diseases. It also developed and evaluated an alexithymia risk-prediction model. A total of 203 older adults with chronic diseases were selected from seven nursing homes in Changsha, China, using simple random and cluster sampling. The participants were surveyed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), and a socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire. The alexithymia total score was 43.85 ± 9.570, with an incidence rate of 8.9%. Alexithymia had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between social support and psychological resilience (the effect value was 0.12), accounting for 19.04% of the total effect. Gender, depression, and psychological resilience were the main independent influencing factors of alexithymia (p < 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of the risk-prediction model was 0.770. The participants, especially those who were male and depressed, exhibited a certain degree of alexithymia. Additionally, it partially mediated the association between social support and psychological resilience, which is a protective factor against alexithymia. The risk-prediction model showed good accuracy and discrimination. Hence, it can be used for preliminary screening of alexithymia in older adults with chronic diseases living in nursing homes. © 2022 by the authors.","","alexithymia; nursing home; older adults with chronic diseases; psychological resilience; risk prediction","","","Hunan Province College, (4402); Open Fund Project of Hunan Normal University, (KF2021039); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82100490)","MDPI","","","","","","English","Geriatrics (Switzerland)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This population faces increased risk of violence, sexual abuse, treatment bias, and a number of health problems when compared with their male counterparts. Further research is needed to identify these differences and suggest clinical implications for working with women with SMI. The present qualitative research includes data from a grounded theory study analyzing interviews with 20 women with SMI to explore their treatment experiences with mental health providers. The following themes pertaining to treatment experiences of women with SMI were generated from qualitative analysis: diminishing dismissals (questions as to the legitimacy of the symptoms and concerns of women with SMI in their mental health treatment), symptom misattribution (erroneous ascriptions of their mental health symptoms), male mistrust (wariness toward, and avoidance of, male providers), psychiatric insults (perceptions that mental health providers tend to make stigmatizing diagnoses), doomsday predictions (experience of providers’ negative prognoses of their future), and diagnostic reordering (tendency of mental health providers to revise prior diagnoses of women with SMI in ways that reduce stigma and build trust). Clinical implications of these findings will be discussed, including the need for enhanced awareness of providers as to the perceptions and expectations of gender bias in treatment among women with SMI.

Adults and children aged 11–14 years with dyslexia and their age-matched controls responded to 360 unique sentences extracted from spontaneous conversations of 40 speakers. In addition to the original unprocessed speech, there were two focused filtered conditions (using lowpass filtering at 400 Hz and 8-channel noise vocoding) probing listeners' responses to segmental and prosodic cues. Compared with controls, both groups with dyslexia were significantly limited in their abilities to recognize dialect features from either set of cues. The results for gender suggest that their comparatively worse gender recognition in the noise-vocoded condition was possibly related to poor temporal resolution. We propose that the deficient processing of indexical cues by individuals with dyslexia originates in peripheral auditory processes, of which impaired processing of relevant temporal cues in amplitude envelope is a likely candidate. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Cues; Dyslexia; Humans; Language; Phonetics; Speech; Speech Perception; adolescent; adult; age; Article; association; auditory discrimination; child; conversation; dyslexia; female; gender; human; information processing; major clinical study; male; noise; phonetics; prosody; reading; recognition; school child; speech analysis; speech discrimination; speech perception; spelling; association; language; speech; speech perception","dyslexia; filtered speech; regional dialect; speech perception; temporal modulation; voice gender","","","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","English","Dyslexia","Article","Final","","Scopus"

I argue that the controversy reveals what I am terming the inclusion paradox of local deliberation. Ordinance supporters’ efforts to foster ethos within the status quo’s political processes and identify with opponents worked to legitimize the very logics and assumptions that enable exclusion. I illustrate the inclusion paradox in how supporters build identification, what arguments they made, where they advanced their claims, and the fact that they did participate in the controversy.

Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and the grey literature for studies predicting the risk of hypertension among the general adult population. Summary statistics from the individual studies were the C-statistic, and a random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled estimates. The predictive performance of pooled estimates was compared between traditional regression-based models and machine learning-based models. The potential sources of heterogeneity were assessed using meta-regression, and study quality was assessed using the PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool) checklist. Results Of 14,778 articles, 52 articles were selected for systematic review and 32 for meta-analysis. The overall pooled C-statistics was 0.75 [0.73–0.77] for the traditional regression-based models and 0.76 [0.72–0.79] for the machine learning-based models. High heterogeneity in C-statistic was observed. The age (p = 0.011), and sex (p = 0.044) of the participants and the number of risk factors considered in the model (p = 0.001) were identified as a source of heterogeneity in traditional regression-based models. Conclusion We attempted to provide a comprehensive evaluation of hypertension risk prediction models. Many models with acceptable-to-good predictive performance were identified. Only a few models were externally validated, and the risk of bias and applicability was a concern in many studies. Overall discrimination was similar between models derived from traditional regression analysis and machine learning methods. More external validation and impact studies to implement the hypertension risk prediction model in clinical practice are required. Copyright: © 2022 Chowdhury et al.

The hate-crimes projected against the trans people in India contribute largely to the mental distresses and other psychological repercussions. This study was conducted to address the antecedents and themes associated with the societal refutation and hate-crimes against trans identity and gender expression, resulting in their marginalization and exoticization. Design/Methodology: This study utilized thematic analysis as the method for data analysis. Transcripts from in-depth interviews of 20 gender-fluid participants were explored to arrive at the themes contributing to marginalization and exoticization among trans people. Findings: The main contributions of this study are: (1) Identification of various themes that are associated with stressors contributing to trans people minority stress. (2) Devising a staged model to highlight the factors that lead to their marginalization from mainstream society. The findings of the study that emerged from the narratives of the participants streamlined various antecedents and themes that refined the understanding of trans person’s marginalization and exoticization. Social Implications: The social implications of the study lie in fostering the understanding for underlying factors that provide impetus to the social discrimination, prejudice, and stigma for gender expression by trans people. This would limit the spectrum of discrimination and violence against the gender minorities. Originality/Value: This study is premised on exploring the factors that aid in progression of exoticization experiences, victimization, violence, and marginalization among trans people in India by navigating through their individual narratives. © 2022 RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR ALL.","","Exoticization; Hate-crimes; Marginalization; Thematic; Trans people; Victimization","","","","RJ4All Publications","","","","","","English","Youth Voice J.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Drawing upon theory on stigma-related stress and resilience and work examining group identification as a buffer against discrimination, the aim of the current study was to model perceived discrimination, transgender identification, and gender identity affirmation as predictors of well-being for TGNC people. We also tested whether the positive association between gender identity affirmation and well-being might be explained by the benefits affirmation has for individual self-concept clarity. Participants were 105 TGNC individuals (42% transgender male, 39% transgender female, 19% other gender non-conforming [e.g., non-binary]) recruited through online forums and support groups in the UK and North America who completed an online survey including self-report measures of key constructs. Results from structural equation models demonstrated that: (1) experiences of discrimination were associated with lower well-being overall, but having a stronger transgender identity moderated this association; (2) after adjustment for discrimination and transgender identification, experiences of gender identity affirmation were independently associated with greater well-being for TGNC people. Secondary analyses demonstrated that gender identity affirmation was linked to well-being through reinforcing a strong, internalized sense of clarity about individual self-concept. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for TGNC health and well-being, particularly with regard to the need for supportive, identity-affirming social environments. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Social Stigma; Transgender Persons; Transsexualism; cross-sectional study; female; gender identity; human; male; social stigma; transgender; transsexualism","Discrimination; Identity affirmation; Self-concept; Transgender; Well-being","","","University of Exeter","Springer","","","","","","English","Arch.

In the Identification task, faces were presented in varying degrees of disfigurement for a simple disfigured / non-disfigured decision. As degree of disfigurement increased, the percentage of participants defining each image as disfigured increased non-linearly such that a cubic curve provided the best fit to the data, consistent with categorical perception (Experiment 1 and 2). In the ABX task, participants displayed superior discrimination between two faces when they crossed the category boundary between non-disfigured and disfigured (Experiment 1 and participants low in Disgust Sensitivity in Experiment 2). Participants high in Disgust Sensitivity (Experiment 2) showed a pattern that suggested the category boundary was shifted towards earlier perception of disfigurement.

Our non-clinical score included age, gender, waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, CVD family history, and dietary parameters. C-indices consistently indicated good discrimination (EPIC-Potsdam 0.786, EPIC-Heidelberg 0.762) comparable to established clinical scores (thereof highest, FRS: EPIC-Potsdam 0.781, EPIC-Heidelberg 0.764). Additional clinical parameters slightly improved discrimination (EPIC-Potsdam 0.796, EPIC-Heidelberg 0.769).

Recently, multi-omics molecular-level measurement enables HCC diagnosis and prognosis prediction, which is crucial for early intervention of personalized therapy to diminish mortality. Here, we introduce a novel strategy utilizing DNA methylation and RNA expression data to achieve a multi-omics gene pair signature (GPS) for HCC discrimination. Results: The immune genes with negative correlations between expression and promoter methylation are enriched in the highly connected cancer-related pathway network, which are considered as the candidates for HCC detection. After that, we separately construct a methylation GPS (mGPS) and an expression GPS (eGPS), and then assemble them as a meGPS with five gene pairs, in which the significant methylation and expression changes occur between HCC tumor and non-tumor groups. Reliable performance has been validated by independent tissue (age, gender and etiology) and blood datasets. This study proposes a procedure for multi-omics GPS identification and develops a novel HCC signature using both methylome and transcriptome data, suggesting potential molecular targets for the detection and therapy of HCC.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; DNA Methylation; Epigenome; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Transcriptome; transcriptome; tumor marker; DNA methylation; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism","","","Biomarkers, Tumor, ","General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council, (14119219, 14119420, 14175617); Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government; Health and Medical Research Fund, HMRF, (06171016, 07181266); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019A1515110097)","Oxford University Press","","","","","","English","Bioinformatics","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Blending ML model which integrated nine sorts of basic ML models was developed for hospital mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis. Model performance was evaluated by various measures related to discrimination or calibration. Results: Twelve thousand five hundred fifty-eight patients from eICU-CRD were included as the training set, and 12,095 patients from MIMIC-III were included as the test set. Both the training set and the test set showed a hospital mortality of 17.9%. Maximum and minimum lactate, maximum and minimum albumin, minimum PaO2/FiO2 and age were important predictors identified by both random forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithm. Blending ML models based on corresponding set of predictors presented better discrimination than SAPS II (AUROC, 0.806 vs. 0.771; AUPRC 0.515 vs. 0.429) and SOFA (AUROC, 0.742 vs. 0.706; AUPRC 0.428 vs. 0.381) on the test set. In addition, calibration curves showed that blending ML models had better calibration than SAPS II. Conclusions: The blending ML model is capable of integrating different sorts of basic ML models efficiently, and outperforms conventional severity scores in predicting hospital mortality among septic patients in ICU. © 2021, The Author(s).","albumin; lactic acid; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; body mass; calibration; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; ethnicity; female; fraction of inspired oxygen; gender; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; prediction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sepsis","eICU-CRD; Hospital mortality prediction; Intensive care unit; Machine learning; MIMIC-III; Sepsis","","lactic acid, 113-21-3, 50-21-5","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","English","BioData Min.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study investigated, for the first time, using emotional inhibition tasks, whether the neural organization of MDD+ subjects is more similar to bipolar depression (BDD) or to MDD subjects without subthreshold bipolar symptoms (MDD-). Method: This study included 118 medication-free young adults (15 – 30 yrs.): 20 BDD, 28 MDD+, 41 MDD- and 29 HC subjects. Participants underwent fMRI during emotional and non-emotional Go/No-go tasks during which they responded for Go stimuli and inhibited response for happy, fear, and non-emotional (gender) faces No-go stimuli. Univariate linear mixed-effects (LME) analysis for group effects and multivariate Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC) analyses were conducted. Results: MDD- group compared to both the BDD and MDD+ groups, exhibited significantly lower activation in parietal, temporal and frontal regions (cluster-wise corrected p <0.05) for emotional inhibition conditions vs. non-emotional condition. GPC classification of emotional (happy + fear) vs. non-emotional response-inhibition activation pattern showed good discrimination between BDD and MDD- subjects (AUC: 0.70; balanced accuracy: 70% (corrected p = 0.018)) as well as between MDD+ and MDD- subjects (AUC: 0.72; balanced accuracy: 67% (corrected p = 0.045)) but less efficient discrimination between BDD and MDD+ groups (AUC: 0.68; balanced accuracy: 61% (corrected p = 0.273)). Notably, classification of the MDD- group was weighted for left amygdala activation pattern. Limitations: Results also need to be tested in a different independent dataset. Conclusion: Using an fMRI emotional Go-Nogo task, MDD- subjects can be discriminated from BDD and MDD+ subjects. © 2020","Bipolar Disorder; Depressive Disorder, Major; Emotions; Facial Expression; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Young Adult; serotonin uptake inhibitor; adolescent; adult; Article; bipolar depression; bipolar I disorder; bipolar II disorder; BOLD signal; brain region; classifier; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; differential diagnosis; emotion; emotional response inhibition; exploratory research; female; follow up; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; Go No Go task; human; inferior temporal gyrus; inhibition (psychology); major clinical study; major depression; male; post hoc analysis; predictive value; priority journal; psychiatric diagnosis; psychopharmacotherapy; reaction time; receiver operating characteristic; task performance; young adult; bipolar disorder; diagnostic imaging; emotion; facial expression; major depression; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","Bipolar Depression; Emotional response inhibition; fMRI; Machine learning; Subthreshold bipolar disorder Young adults","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH093420)","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","J.

Early identification of MCI is beneficial, and it can delay the development of dementia. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model to predict MCI of middle-aged and elderly people (aged 45 years and over). Methods: According to 478 middle-aged and elderly people (48–85 years old) from a cross-sectional study, we developed and validated a predictive nomogram. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to select variables and develop a prediction model. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated in terms of its discriminative power, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: The predictive nomogram was composed of the following: age, gender, education level, residence, and reading. The model showed good discrimination power (area under receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.8704) and good calibration. Similar results were seen in 10-fold cross-validation. The nomogram showed clinically useful in DCA analysis. Conclusion: This predictive nomogram provides researchers with a practical tool for predicting MCI. The variables included in this nomogram were readily available. The population used for this nomogram was middle-aged and elderly people. © 2022","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Humans; Middle Aged; Nomograms; ROC Curve; aged; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; dementia; human; middle aged; nomogram; receiver operating characteristic; very elderly","Middle-aged and elderly people; Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Nomogram; Rugao","","","Joint innovation team of Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, (TFCT-A02); Graduate Research and Innovation Projects of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX21_3120); Science and Technology Project of Nantong City, (MSZ21043)","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","Asian J.

To evaluate whether the learning styles discriminate the cumulative gross point average (CGPA) scores and self-directed learning hours (SDL) in an integrated curriculum of dental students. Methods: Participants in this blinded cross-sectional study were dental students enrolled in the Bachelor of Dental & Oral Surgery program at XXXX College of Dentistry. An online survey (Kolb Learning Style Inventory) was used to collect data. It has four sections: Concrete Experience (CE), Abstract Conceptualization (AC), Reflective Observation (RO), and Active Experimentation (AE). Questionnaire was distributed electronically to students of Academic level 1 to 5, selected by using non-probability quota sampling technique. In addition to learning style assessment the questionnaire also included measures to obtain data such as gender, academic level, CGPA score, and SDL hours of participants. The CGPA scores were categorized into average (3 to 3.6), good (3.7 to 4.2), excellent (4.3 to 4.7) and outstanding (> 4.7) as well as SDL in to three classes as, < 1 h, > 1 but < 3 h and > 3 h. Discriminant function test was computed to assess the effectiveness of discrimination by the learning styles in GPA and SDL. Results: The study's questionnaire was completed by 198 participants (43% females and 57% males). Learning styles were discriminated by excellent category of CGPA scores that presented 72.1% group membership whereas in case of outstanding category presented the least as 17% group membership. Learning styles were discriminated by > 2 but < 3 h category of SDL hours that presented 69.7% group membership. Conclusion: Learning styles can be used to discriminate the student academic performances and self-directed learning hours. Among the different category of CGPA participants with outstanding performance represent a good prediction for learning styles preferences. Participants with varying SDL hours also influenced the learning styles. © 2022, The Author(s).","Academic Performance; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Students, Dental; academic achievement; adult; article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; cross-sectional study; curriculum; dental student; dentistry; discriminant analysis; female; gender; human; human experiment; learning; learning style; major clinical study; male; oral surgery; prediction; questionnaire; self-directed learning; single blind procedure; academic achievement; learning","cumulative gross point average score; Dental students; Learning styles; Self-direct learning","","","Al Jouf University, (DSR-2021-01-0111)","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","English","BMC Med.

Otherwise, their obscure decision-making processes can lead to socioethical issues as they interfere with people’s lives. Random forest algorithms excel in the aforementioned sectors, where their ability to explain themselves is an obvious requirement. In this paper, we present LionForests, which relies on a preliminary work of ours. LionForests is a random forest-specific interpretation technique that provides rules as explanations. It applies to binary classification tasks up to multi-class classification and regression tasks, while a stable theoretical background supports it. A time and scalability analysis suggests that LionForests is much faster than our preliminary work and is also applicable to large datasets. Experimentation, including a comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrate the efficacy of our contribution. LionForests outperformed the other techniques in terms of precision, variance, and response time, but fell short in terms of rule length and coverage. Finally, we highlight conclusiveness, a unique property of LionForests that provides interpretation validity and distinguishes it from previous techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Machine learning; Random forests; Decision-making process; Economic damages; Explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Local interpretation; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Model-specific interpretation; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Large dataset","Explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Local interpretation; Model-specific interpretation; Random forests","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (825619)","Springer","","","","","","English","Data Min.

This unintended discrimination is often caused by underlying correlations in the data between protected attributes and other observed characteristics used by the algorithm to create predictions and target individuals optimally. Because these correlations are hidden in high-dimensional data, removing protected attributes from the database does not solve the discrimination problem; instead, removing those attributes often exacerbates the problem by making it undetectable and in some cases, even increases the bias generated by the algorithm. We propose BEAT (bias-eliminating adapted trees) to address these issues. This approach allows decision makers to target individuals based on differences in their predicted behavior-hence, capturing value from personalization-while ensuring a balanced allocation of resources across individuals, guaranteeing both group and individual fairness. Essentially, the method only extracts heterogeneity in the data that is unrelated to protected attributes. To do so, we build on the general random forest (GRF) framework [S. Athey et al., Ann. Stat. 47, 1148-1178 (2019)] and develop a targeting allocation that is “balanced” with respect to protected attributes. We validate BEAT using simulations and an online experiment with N = 3,146 participants. This approach can be applied to any type of allocation decision that is based on prediction algorithms, such as medical treatments, hiring decisions, product recommendations, or dynamic pricing.

Based purely on the individual selection of fillers, we report in this study that 1) speaker discrimination performance was better in the male (ca. 85% accuracy) than the female (ca. 75% accuracy) speakers by approximately 10%, and 2) the poorer performance of the female speakers was due to the larger within-speaker differences in the female speakers than the male speakers. That is, the selection of fillers by female speakers is more variable, speech by speech, than that by male speakers, even under similar conditions (e.g. same type of audience and the same degree of formality).

No EEG marker can help differentiate PNES cases from healthy subjects. In this paper, we have investigated the power spectrum density (PSD), in resting-state EEGs, to evaluate the abnormalities in PNES affected brains. Additionally, we have used functional connectivity tools, such as phase lag index (PLI), and graph-derived metrics to better observe the integration of distributed information of regular and synchronized multi-scale communication within and across inter-regional brain areas. We proved the utility of our method after enrolling a cohort study of 20 age-and gender-matched PNES and 19 healthy control (HC) subjects. In this work, three classification models, namely support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP), have been employed to model the relationship between the functional connectivity features (rest-HC versus rest-PNES). The best performance for the discrimination of participants was obtained using the MLP classifier, reporting a precision of 85.73%, a recall of 86.57%, an F1-score of 78.98%, and, finally, an accuracy of 91.02%. In conclusion, our results hypothesized two main aspects. The first is an intrinsic organization of functional brain networks that reflects a dysfunctional level of integration across brain regions, which can provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of PNES. The second is that functional connectivity features and MLP could be a promising method to classify rest-EEG data of PNES form healthy controls subjects. © 2021 by the authors.

In this systematic review we explore the role functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has played in understanding olfactory perception in humans. fNIRS is an optical neuroimaging technique able to measure changes in brain hemodynamics and oxygenation related to neural electrical activity. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, results of this search found that generally the majority of studies involving healthy adult subjects observed increased activity in response to odors. Other population types were also observed, such as infants, individuals with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dysosmia. fNIRS coverage heavily favored the prefrontal cortex, temporal and parietal regions. This review finds that odor induced cortical activation is dependent on multiple factors, such as odorant type, gender and population type. This review also finds that there is room for improvement in areas such as participant diversity, use of wearable fNIRS systems, physiological monitoring and multi-distance channels.

Little research has examined the diversity of drinking trajectories among sexual minorities, despite evidence that such trajectories have high predictive utility and are useful in understanding how risk factors may be uniquely associated with specific trajectories. Method: We utilized four waves of data (12 months between waves) from a sample of 1,057 SMW ages 18–25 at Wave 1. The goals were to (a) identify multiple distinct trajectories of alcohol use; (b) examine the predictive utility of these trajectories; and (c) test associations between minority stress (e.g., discrimination) and social influence (e.g., sexual minority community involvement) risk factors and alcohol trajectories. Results: Using growth mixture modeling, we identified five classes based on drinking patterns at Wave 1 and change over time (stable low, stable high drinking, stable high HED, low increasing, and high decreasing). These classes were differentially associated with Wave 1 levels and changes in alcohol consequences. Minority stressors uniquely predicted a low increasing trajectory, while social influences uniquely predicted a stable high trajectory. Both minority stress and social risk factors predicted high decreasing and stable high HED trajectories. Conclusions: Findings indicate that some drinking trajectories among SMW appear similar to those found in the general population, while others appear unique. Results provide insight into how minority stress and social influence risk factors may uniquely and jointly contribute to disparities affecting this population. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescent; Adult; Alcoholism; Female; Heterosexuality; Humans; Risk Factors; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior; Young Adult; alcohol; adult; age; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Article; bisexuality; coping behavior; drinking behavior; female; heterosexuality; homosexual female; human; information processing; motivation; normal human; prediction; risk factor; sex difference; sexual and gender minority; social aspect; social discrimination; social interaction; social stress; young adult; adolescent; alcoholism; sexual behavior","Alcohol use; Minority stress; Sexual minority; Social influences","","alcohol, 64-17-5","National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (K01DA046716); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, (R01AA018292)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Addict.

Charge prediction is one of the core tasks of Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). It aims to predict charge from complicated legal facts, so as to help the court make judgments or provide legal professional guidance to non-professionals. In the field of legalAI, interpretability is crucial compared to others. Reasonable interpretability can eliminate hidden dangers such as gender discrimination and provide support for judges’ decisions. However, how to add the legal theory framework to the modeling to improve the interpretability is a challenge, which has few researches at present. To address this problem, we use Double-layer Criminal System as a guide to build Charge Prediction modeling called DCSCP which aims to predict charges in the criminal law of China. In general, our characteristic is to achieve multi-granularity inference of legal charges by obtaining the subjective and objective elements from the fact descriptions of legal cases. Specifically, our approach is performed in two steps: (1) extract the objective elements from the fact description and use them to generate candidate charges to achieve coarse-grained prediction; (2) extract the subjective elements from the fact description, and design the first-order predicate logic inference to realize the fine-grained charge inference in combination with the candidate charges. Experimental results show that our DCSCP can provide interpretable predictions, and it can maintain performance compared to other state-of-the-art charge prediction models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Crime; Forecasting; Coarse-grained; Fact descriptions; Gender discrimination; Interpretability; Multi-granularity; Predicate logic; Prediction model; State of the art; Predictive analytics","Charge prediction; Double-layer criminal system; Inference; Interpretability","","","","Springer","","","","","","English","World Wide Web","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The workpoints of male labor were also higher than those for female labor. Therefore, there was a gender difference that applied to both cattle and humans, but the former was not simply the social projection and cultural metaphor of the latter; rather they shared the same natural difference in terms of economic value in that given system. Namely, the values of humans and cattle depended entirely on their contribution to agricultural labor, not on gender discrimination. The reason for this phenomenon is that the ecological environment and living conditions shaped people's psychology, which then determined the internal classification structure of gender in humans as well as animals. The classification attitude of the values of humans and animals was thus a result of adaptation to the natural environment and living conditions, and, as such, was a collective survival strategy, but it was also the product of a particular economic system. This phenomenon resulted from the fact that the privately owned land of individual families had been collectivized, revealing some characteristics of the cattle-raising mode under the collective economic system. The case of Lingqian Village in Shandong Province contributes to world anthropology by illustrating one particular system of social livelihood, with cattle as the reference point.

Aims To use a probability sample to study change in mental health inequalities between two survey points, 7 years apart; the contribution of minority stress; and whether associations vary by age, gender, childhood sexual abuse, and religious identification. Methods We analysed data from 10 443 people, in two English population-based surveys (2007 and 2014), on common mental disorder (CMD), hazardous alcohol use, and illicit drug use. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, gender, and economic factors, adding interaction terms for survey year, age, gender, childhood sexual abuse, and religious identification. We explored bullying and discrimination as mediators. Results Inequalities in risks of CMD or substance misuse were unchanged between 2007 and 2014. Compared to heterosexuals, bisexual, and lesbian/gay people were more likely to have CMD, particularly bisexual people [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.86; 95% CI 1.83-4.46], and to report alcohol misuse and illicit drug use. When adjusted for bullying, odds of CMD remained elevated only for bisexual people (AOR = 3.21; 95% CI 1.64-6.30), whilst odds of alcohol and drug misuse were unchanged. When adjusted for discrimination, odds of CMD and alcohol misuse remained elevated only for bisexual people (AOR = 2.91; 95% CI 1.80-4.72; and AOR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.03-2.57 respectively), whilst odds of illicit drug use remained unchanged. There were no interactions with age, gender, childhood sexual abuse, or religious identification. Conclusions Mental health inequalities in non-heterosexuals have not narrowed, despite increasing societal acceptance. Bullying and discrimination may help explain the elevated rate of CMD in lesbian women and gay men but not in bisexual people.  © 2021 The Author(s).

The accurate prediction of mortality hazards is key to precision medicine, which can help clinicians make optimal therapeutic decisions to extend the survival times of individual patients with DLBCL. Thus, we have developed a predictive model to predict the mortality hazard of DLBCL patients within 2 years of treatment. Methods: We evaluated 406 patients with DLBCL and collected 17 variables from each patient. The predictive variables were selected by the Cox model, the logistic model and the random forest algorithm. Five classifiers were chosen as the base models for ensemble learning: the naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine and feedforward neural network models. We first calibrated the biased outputs from the five base models by using probability calibration methods (including shape-restricted polynomial regression, Platt scaling and isotonic regression). Then, we aggregated the outputs from the various base models to predict the 2-year mortality of DLBCL patients by using three strategies (stacking, simple averaging and weighted averaging). Finally, we assessed model performance over 300 hold-out tests. Results: Gender, stage, IPI, KPS and rituximab were significant factors for predicting the deaths of DLBCL patients within 2 years of treatment. The stacking model that first calibrated the base model by shape-restricted polynomial regression performed best (AUC = 0.820, ECE = 8.983, MCE = 21.265) in all methods. In contrast, the performance of the stacking model without undergoing probability calibration is inferior (AUC = 0.806, ECE = 9.866, MCE = 24.850). In the simple averaging model and weighted averaging model, the prediction error of the ensemble model also decreased with probability calibration. Conclusions: Among all the methods compared, the proposed model has the lowest prediction error when predicting the 2-year mortality of DLBCL patients.

Many gambling operators rely on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify online players at risk. Models are typically gender-blind (gender not included as an input), reflecting the sensitivity of protected characteristic data. However, some stakeholders worry that gender continues to influence the model via other variables (indirect identification) and worry about differential model performance by gender (algorithmic fairness). In this paper, we investigate these concerns using real-world data from 22,500 players across two gambling operators. We propose a method for testing the indirect identification of a protected variable. We identify near-zero levels of indirect identification of gender. Regarding algorithmic fairness, a slight pro-female bias is found in the first ML model and a moderate pro-female bias in found in the second ML model. The challenge is to mitigate such bias without the intrusion of compulsory gender data collection. We propose a new approach which uses gender data for training only, constructing separate models for each gender and combining trained models into an ensemble that does not require gender data once deployed. Since harm identification adopts a precautionary principle, if any one model indicates potential harm, the player is flagged as at risk. This approach is shown to reduce the difference per gender in the True Positive Rate (TPR) of the models from 7.2% points to 4.0% points. This is shown to be better than what can be achieved by simply altering the models’ classification thresholds. Both the indirect identification and the algorithmic fairness approaches are part of a wider framework and taxonomy being proposed towards the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the gambling industry.

However, the potential mechanisms and moderating conditions involved in this process have been little studied. This experiment examined how perceived societal (in)equity of one’s own group may influence one’s reaction to other marginalized groups. We randomly assigned 310 cisgender White lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults to conditions varying in LGB (in)equity salience (discrimination, affirmation, control) and in the target outgroup identity (transgender, Black). Participants completed a survey assessing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the outgroup, that is, indicators of allyship. Based on the emerging theory of stigma-based solidarity, we expected LGB discrimination to improve intergroup relations with transgender people (i.e. a group readily sharing a common superordinate identity with LGB people) but worsen relations with Black people (i.e. a group not readily sharing a common superordinate identity). Counter to expectations, allyship variables were not predicted by discrimination as a main effect or in interaction with outgroup identity. However, we found support for the mediating role of emotions in explaining the indirect effect of discrimination on allyship. For example, discrimination produced greater outgroup identification by elevating negative affect, but only when the outgroup was transgender people. Results for transgender and Black targets converged for outcomes requiring participants to consider societal injustice toward the outgroup. We observed only one effect for affirmation: It reduced LGB people’s empathic anger for both transgender and Black people. Results may inform efforts of coalition building. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Policy Relevance Statement: This study of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults suggests that emotion partially explains the positive effects of discrimination salience on LGB people’s support for other marginalized groups. Results also show that LGB people’s responses to other marginalized groups may depend on their sense of shared fate with the outgroup and their awareness of injustice facing the outgroup.

Gender disparities result in part from the accumulation of subtle, typically unintentional biases that pervade workplace structures, practices, and patterns of interactions that inadvertently favor men. However, the subtle nature of gender bias makes it difficult to detect and thus diminishes the likelihood of action to address it. We experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of a brief intervention, the Workshop Activity for Gender Equity Simulation in the Academy (WAGES-Academic), which was designed to increase recognition of subtle gender bias in the academic workplace. Participants (N = 177) completed either the WAGES intervention or one of two control conditions and later evaluated promotion and tenure materials of a woman faculty member who received either a blatant sexist, subtle sexist, or nonsexist review. Consistent with hypotheses, WAGES participants (vs. controls) detected more subtle gender bias (ps <.02) and were subsequently more likely to report concerns about bias (ps <.04). Results suggest that low-cost interventions that educate individuals about subtle bias in a nonthreatening way may increase detection and reporting of gender bias in higher education institutions. ©, © The Ohio State University.","","Active learning; discrimination; experiential learning; gender bias; intervention; sexism","","","","Taylor and Francis Inc.","","","","","","English","J.

Almost 60% of the photos are human faces. There might be an increase in face search in future because human faces are closely associated with social media where people show special interest on specific personalities. The main issue raised in the face retrieval system is the various intra-class variances like expression, pose and illumination. Most of the conventional approaches lack the accuracy to meet the human intuition for retrieving images. The proposed approach develops a Dynamic Multi-Attribute Priority-based Face Attribute Detection (DMAP-FAD) method based on contextual information of the face (Race and Gender) by detecting the attributes dynamically. This approach can provide better discrimination of the face image retrieval system by detecting the attributes dynamically. The digital binning technique is applied for improving the lighting differences for illumination. The proposed method effectively minimized the semantic gap and achieved high accuracy by focusing on the variations involved in the pose, illumination, and expression with dynamically detected an optimal set of attributes from the original set of attributes by using contextual relationship. In the experimental results, the proposed method has been tested efficiently by the metrics such as F-Score, Precision and Recall with help of Pubfig and LFW datasets and it is observed that the proposed method obtained an overall accuracy of 95.63% for higher discrimination of face image retrieval system. The results are comparable with those of the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Image retrieval; Search engines; Semantics; Attribute detections; Contextual information; Contextual relationships; Conventional approach; Face image retrieval; Overall accuracies; Precision and recall; State-of-the-art methods; Face recognition","DMAP-FAD; Face image retrieval; Indexing; Multiple face attributes; Sparse Codewords","","","","Springer","","","","","","English","Multimedia Tools Appl","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Intercategorical quantitative applications have focused primarily on describing health or social inequalities across intersectional groups, coded using cross-classified categories or interaction terms. This descriptive intersectionality omits consideration of the mediating processes (e.g., discrimination) through which intersectional positions impact outcome inequalities, which offer opportunities for intervention. Objective: We argue for the importance of a quantitative analytic intersectionality. We identify methodological challenges and potential solutions in structuring studies to allow for both intersectional heterogeneity in outcomes and in the ways that processes such as discrimination may cause these outcomes for those at different intersections. Method: To incorporate both mediation and exposure-mediator interaction, we use VanderWeele's three-way decomposition methodology, adapt the interpretation for application to analytic intersectionality studies, and present a step-by-step analytic approach. Using online panel data collected from Canada and the United States in 2016 (N = 2542), we illustrate this approach with a statistical analysis of whether and to what extent observed inequalities in psychological distress across intersections of ethnoracial group and sexual or gender minority (SGM) status may be explained by past-year experiences of day-to-day discrimination, assessed using the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI). Results and conclusions: We describe actual and adjusted intersectional inequalities in psychological distress and decompose them to identify three component effects for each of 11 intersectional comparison groups (e.g., Indigenous SGM), versus the reference intersectional group that experienced the lowest levels of discrimination (white non-SGM). These reflect the expected inequality in outcome: 1) due to membership in the more discriminated-against group, if its members had experienced the same lower levels of discrimination as the reference intersection; 2) due to unequal levels of discrimination; and 3), due to unequal effects of discrimination. We present considerations for use and interpretation of these methods. © 2018 The Authors","Canada; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Social Discrimination; United States; equity; minority group; quantitative analysis; race; racism; research method; statistical analysis; article; Canada; controlled study; decomposition; female; health equity; human; major clinical study; male; mediator; mental stress; quantitative analysis; race; sexual and gender minority; social determinants of health; statistical analysis; statistics; United States; classification; evaluation study; health disparity; social discrimination","Discrimination; Gender; Health equity; Intersectionality; Race; Research design methods; Social determinants of health; Statistics","","","Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (130489); Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Soc.

Research on sexual identity development has typically focused on ages of achieving specific milestones (i.e., awareness, identification, sexual experience, and disclosure), though differences in onset and speed of the process and impact of these trajectories on healthy functioning in adulthood are understudied. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 374 highly sexually active gay and bisexual men in New York City. Using latent growth curve modeling, we examined trajectories of sexual identity development through the 4 afforementioned milestones. We next examined their associations with childhood and background characteristics, adult experiences of sexual minority stress, and adult mental health. Results showed that identifying as gay and greater childhood gender nonconformity were associated with earlier reported onset of sexual identity development, and younger age was significantly associated with faster progression through the developmental process. The model showed that faster progression through sexual identity development was associated with higher levels of sexual orientation- based discrimination, emotion dysregulation, sexual compulsivity, and anxiety and depression in adulthood, but not internalized homonegativity or sexual orientation-based rejection sensitivity. These findings support the need for a comprehensive and developmentally informed model of adulthood functioning among gay and bisexual men that considers trajectories of sexual identity development-including onset and duration-as potential precursors to mental health difficulties in adulthood. Given the early onset of sexual identity development and potential lifelong sequelae, early prevention programs promoting positive sexual identity development are warranted. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","","Discrimination; Mental health; Minority stress; Sexual identity development; Stigma","","","National Institute of Mental Health Research, (R01-MH087714); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (K01-DA039030)","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Psychol.

The present study aimed to assess palatal rugae patterns in a sample Iranian population and to compare the results with those from other studied populations. Methods: During summer 2017, 130 pre-orthodontic plaster casts from patients aged 17-25 years (65 males and 65 females) were obtained from the Department of Orthodontics, School of Dentistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. The castes were evaluated using the classification given by Thomas and Kotze followed by recording the rugae lengths and shapes. The data were analyzed with the SPSS statistical software package (version 15.0) using the unpaired t test and Chi-square test. P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Additionally, discriminant function analysis was applied to determine the applicability of palatal rugae patterns as a tool to aid sex identification. Results: The rugae count showed an insignificant difference between the Iranian males and females. The primary rugae were most common in both sexes followed by the secondary and fragmentary. Significant differences were observed between the sexes and the number of primary rugae in males (P=0.03) and fragmentary rugae in females (P=0.04) on the left side of the palate. A significant difference in the straight and diverging unification types was observed, which was highest in males (P=0.01) and females (P=0.03), respectively. Discriminant function analysis enabled sex identification with an accuracy of 70%. Conclusion: Palatal rugae is shown to be an appropriate tool for sex identification in an Iranian population. Further studies with a larger sample size are required for a comprehensive outcome. © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

Intersex people are born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male or female bodies, as a result of which they are stigmatised, marginalised and denied the recognition of their fundamental rights. Often, they are subjected to involuntary and harmful sex ""normalising"" surgeries at birth, which violate their bodily integrity, self-determination and informed consent, so as to comply with societal and legal norms. Moreover, binary legal frameworks prevent them from enjoying the rights to access identification documents, start a family, or be free from discrimination in all areas including employment and sports. To elaborate on intersex violations that emanate from binary laws, this book examines the situation of intersex rights in regional jurisdictions worldwide and within the European Union in particular. In the process, it identifies current legal barriers and suggests how intersex people could be accommodated under legal frameworks and achieve sex/gender equality beyond binary definitions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Existing work on the problem operates under the assumption that the sensitive feature available in one's training sample is perfectly reliable. This assumption may be violated in many real-world cases: for example, respondents to a survey may choose to conceal or obfuscate their group identity out of fear of potential discrimination. This poses the question of whether one can still learn fair classifiers given noisy sensitive features. In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative: we show that if one measures fairness using the mean-difference score, and sensitive features are subject to noise from the mutually contaminated learning model, then owing to a simple identity we only need to change the desired fairness-tolerance. The requisite tolerance can be estimated by leveraging existing noise-rate estimators from the label noise literature. We finally show that our procedure is empirically effective on two case-studies involving sensitive feature censoring. © 2019 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We used machine learning to evaluate modifiable and genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), to predict cognitive decline. Methods: Health and Retirement Study participants, aged 65-90 years, with DNA and >2 cognitive evaluations, were included (n = 7,142). Predictors included age, body mass index, gender, education, APOE ϵ4, cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), and AD risk genes. Latent class trajectory analyses of cognitive scores determined the form and number of classes. Random Forests (RF) classification investigated predictors of cognitive trajectories. Performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) were reported. Results: Three classes were identified. Discriminating highest from lowest classes produced the best RF performance: accuracy = 78% (1.0%), sensitivity = 75% (1.0%), and specificity = 81% (1.0%). Top ranked predictors were education, age, gender, stroke, NSES, and diabetes, APOE ϵ4 carrier status, and body mass index (BMI). When discriminating high from medium classes, top predictors were education, age, gender, stroke, diabetes, NSES, and BMI. When discriminating medium from the low classes, education, NSES, age, diabetes, and stroke were top predictors. Discussion: The combination of latent trajectories and RF classification techniques suggested that nongenetic factors contribute more to cognitive decline than genetic factors. Education was the most relevant predictor for discrimination. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America. All rights reserved.

Adopting a feminist perspective, I scrutinize the act from a largely neglected position, one that supports both LGBTQ and sex-based rights. Although laudable in its aims, the Equality Act is objectionable in form. The Act extends non-discrimination protections to LGBTQ individuals not by creating new protected classes but by redefining sex to include gender identity and sexual orientation, which is not only terminologically imprecise but also creates a clash between sex-based and gender identity-based rights. By defining gender identity as something that exists to be protected “regardless of sex,” the act undermines sex-based provisions, replacing them with provisions based on gender self-identification. Recognizing confusion over terminology, I describe key terms (sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation) and consider various usages. I conclude by discussing ways the bill might be modified so as to protect LGBTQ people without undermining women’s (sex-based) rights. © The Author(s) 2020.","","Equality Act; feminism; LGBTQ; sex and gender; transgender; women’s rights","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","Fem.

To increase representation and discrimination capability of the deep neural networks, we benefited from domain adaptation and employed center loss besides softmax loss. We conducted extensive experiments on the UND-F, UND-J2, and FERET datasets. Experimental results indicated that profile face images contain a rich source of information for age and gender classification. We found that the presented multimodal system achieves very high age and gender classification accuracies.

Face images with various ages of the same person can be considered as unpaired images which come from different domains. The degree of aging effect can be influenced by age, gender, race and some other factors. In this paper, we are committed to studying the impact of gender on face aging problem, which involves the processing and modeling of face images. It has been proved that Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) is competitive in realistic image synthesis, and many works employed Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks(CycleGANs) have shown the high performance in unpaired image-to-image translation. To overcome current difficulties and improve the performance of existing models on the face aging tasks, we proposed an innovative Gender-based training method using CycleGAN by pairwise training CycleGAN over several age groups which are grouped by age and gender. We build a constraint model based on gender discrimination to better simulate the expected aging effect of face images. To evaluate our works using subjective method, we have set up a quantitative evaluation mechanism with participants involved in. Compared with other similar subjective evaluation methods, our method is more objective in the demonstration of experimental results. The experimental results show that our method has a more realistic and excellent performance compared to those using CycleGAN for face age synthesis directly. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Computer applications; Electrical engineering; Adversarial networks; Different domains; Gender discrimination; Processing and modeling; Quantitative evaluation; Realistic image synthesis; Subjective evaluations; Subjective methods; Image processing","Age estimation; Age group classification; Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks; Face aging; Image-to-Image translation; Subjective test","","","Key Research and Development Plan - Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of ShanDong Province, (2019JZZY020101); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61902203)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Image Vision Comput","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Policy- makers, auditors and end users have concern regarding the prediction model whether these predictive models are making bias/unfair decision or not. There is the possibility that model can generate wrong decision due to bias. This bias can be intentional or unintentional discrimination due to some of the features present in the dataset. Bias arises in many industries like Banking, Housing, Education, Finance, Insurance, etc. which uses AI model for prediction. If the significance of the feature is high and also the feature is considered as protected attribute, namely race, religion, gender, then the feature can possibly contribute to bias in the prediction. To deal with this problem FairML model could help us. FairML is a framework that is put to use to discover bias in the predictive ML models. Basically it consists of four ranking algorithms (Iterative orthogonal feature projection (IOFP), Minimum Redundancy, Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Lasso Regression, Random forest) which helps in finding the significance of the features. FairML ranking algorithms handles both linear and non-linear dependencies. In this paper we have studied different feature algorithm for different prediction models in order to get the significant features as prediction models are used in every field. © BEIESP.","","Bias; FairML; Feature significance; IOFP; LASSO; MRMR; Variable ranking","","","","Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication","","","","","","English","Int.

Using conservation of resources theory, this multi-source study examines the association between perceived family responsibility discrimination and work–life conflict as mediated by emotional exhaustion. Employee gender and power distance values are tested as moderators of the perceived family responsibility discrimination to emotional exhaustion relationship. Results suggest that male employees who perceive family responsibility discrimination from their supervisor and hold high power distance values experience increased emotional exhaustion and work–life conflict. Female workers who perceive family responsibility discrimination from their supervisor experience increased emotional exhaustion and work–life conflict regardless of whether they have high or low power distance. Findings are consistent with theory-based predictions from conservation of resources theory: resources that are valued and not provided in the work context deplete emotional energies and ultimately trigger work–life conflict. Findings build on the work–life literature by introducing gender and power distance as factors that shape when employees feel the draining effects of family responsibility discrimination. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","","Conservation of resources; Emotional exhaustion; Family responsibility discrimination; Gender; Power distance; Work–life conflict","","","","Springer","","","","","","English","J.

The English alphabetic code is opaque, and it has been stated that deep orthographies cause important problems in children with dyslexia. Considering the strong differences between the Spanish and English orthographic systems, we predicted English reading problems in Spanish-speaking children with dyslexia. The current study focused on English as a foreign language in a group of 22 Spanish children with dyslexia (8–12 year olds), compared to a control group matched for age, gender, grade, and socioeconomic status. The objective was to identify the main difficulties that Spanish-speaking children with dyslexia demonstrate during English reading, to develop specific teaching programs. Participants were given four tasks related to reading: discrimination of phonemes, visual lexical decision, reading aloud, and oral vs. written semantic classification. The results suggest that children with dyslexia demonstrate problems in using English grapheme–phoneme rules, forcing them to employ a lexical strategy to read English words. However, they also showed difficulties in developing orthographic representations of words. Finally, they also exhibited problems with oral language, demonstrating difficulties accessing semantic information from an auditory presentation. © Copyright © 2020 Suárez-Coalla, Martínez-García and Carnota.","","children; dyslexia; English as a foreign language; reading; Spanish","","","Spanish Government, (PSI2015-64174-P); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","English","Front.

To inform policies and health programs, trans women worked with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)- and President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported LINKAGES project, the United Nations Development Programme, The University of the West Indies, and local organizations to document experiences of GBV and transphobia in healthcare, education, and police encounters. Trans women conducted 74 structured interviews with other trans women in El Salvador, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, and Haiti in 2016. We conducted qualitative applied thematic analysis to understand the nature and consequences of GBV and transphobia and descriptive quantitative analysis to identify the proportion who experienced GBV in each context. A high proportion experienced GBV in education (85.1%), healthcare (82.9%), from police (80.0%), and other state institutions (66.1%). Emotional abuse was the most common in all contexts and included gossiping, insults, and refusal to use their chosen name. Participants also experienced economic, physical, and sexual violence, and other human rights violations based on their gender identity and expression. At school, participants were physically threatened and assaulted, harassed in bathrooms, and denied education. In healthcare, participants were given lower priority and received substandard care. Healthcare workers and police blamed participants for their health and legal problems, and denied them services. From police, participants also experienced physical and sexual assault, theft, extortion for sex or money, and arbitrary arrest and detention. Participants had difficulty obtaining identification documents that matched their gender identity, sometimes being forced to alter their appearance or being denied an identification card. Service providers not only failed to meet the specific needs of trans women but also discriminated against them when they sought services, exacerbating their economic, health, and social vulnerability. Although international and regional resolutions call for the legal protection of transgender people, states do not meet these obligations. To respect, promote, and fulfill trans women’s human rights, governments should enact and enforce antidiscrimination and gender-affirming laws and policies. Governments should also sensitize providers to deliver gender-affirming services. © Michele Lanham et al. 2019.","","Caribbean; Discrimination; Gender-based violence; Key populations; Latin America; Transgender","","","United States Agency for International Development, USAID; U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR; University of the West Indies, UWI; United Nations Development Programme, UNDP; Ministry of Employment and Labor, MOEL","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","","","","","","English","Violence Gend.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Over the past twenty-five years, the transgender movement has gained statutory nondiscrimination protections at the state and local levels, hate crimes protections in a number of states, inclusion in a federal law against hate crimes, legal victories in the courts, and increasingly favorable policies in bureaucracies at all levels. It has achieved these victories despite the relatively small number of trans people and despite the widespread discrimination, poverty, and violence experienced by many in the transgender community. This is a remarkable achievement in a political system where public policy often favors those with important resources that the transgender community lacks: access, money, and voters. The Remarkable Rise of Transgender Rights explains the growth of the transgender rights movement despite its marginalized status within the current political opportunity structure. © 2018 by Jami K.

Parents described pressures to “fit” into providers’ limited understanding of family. Some parents described facing overt discrimination, including one parent who was seen as a possible sexual predator. Some described being perceived as representatives of “diversity” for organizations, or “pet lesbians” in the words of one couple. Others described being misread as a non-parent, as in “just the nanny,” particularly in conjunction with their racial minority status. Parents described how their experiences of being “outside the mainstream” helped them challenge systems and normative beliefs.

We ask if the stereotypical belief, that members of the same sexual orientation group share similar acoustic patterns, is accurate to some degree. To address this issue, we are the first to use a novel voice morphing technique to create voice averages from voices that represent extremes of a given sexual orientation group either in terms of actual or perceived sexual orientation. Importantly, averaging preserves only those acoustic cues shared by the original speakers. 144 German listeners judged the sexual orientation of twelve natural-sounding sentence stimuli, each representing an average of five original utterances. Half of the averages were based on targets’ self-ratings of sexual orientation: On a 7-point Kinsey-like scale, we selected targets who were most typical for a certain sexual orientation group according to their self-identifications. The other half were based on extreme ratings by others (i.e., on speech-related sexual-orientation stereotypes). Listeners judged sexual orientation from the voice averages with above-chance accuracy suggesting 1) that the perception of actual and stereotypical sexual orientation, respectively, are based on acoustic cues shared by speakers of the same group, and 2) that the stereotypical belief that members of the same sexual orientation group share similar acoustic patterns is accurate to some degree. Mean fundamental frequency and other common acoustic parameters showed systematic variation depending on speaker gender and sexual orientation. Effects of sexual orientation were more pronounced for stereotypical voice averages than for those based on speakers’ self-ratings, suggesting that sexual-orientation stereotypes exaggerate even those differences present in the most salient groups of speakers. Implications of our findings for stereotyping and discrimination are discussed. © 2018 Kachel et al.

To date, however, this model has been tested in samples of participants with only one stigmatized identity. In three studies, we show that women of color attribute rejection to sexism more than racism when men are involved and to racism more than sexism when Whites are involved. Participants clearly attended to situational cues, despite predictions advanced in past research that women of color see all ambiguous situations in the same way: as involving primarily racism (ethnic prominence) or as involving both racism and sexism (double jeopardy). Study 3 further revealed that double-jeopardy-like attributions are more likely when rejections involve “double” out-group members, and single attributions are more likely when rejections involve “partial” out-group members. © The Author(s) 2020.","","discrimination attributions; gender; intersectionality; race","","","Tufts University","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Soc.

In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to a dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly-available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data.

A reliable and accurate measurement of stress can give an estimate of an individual's stress burden. It is necessary to take essential steps to relieve the burden and regain control for better health. Listening to music is a way that can help in breaking the hold of stress. This study examines the effect of music tracks in English and Urdu language on human stress level using brain signals. Twenty-seven subjects including 14 males and 13 females having Urdu as their first language, with ages ranging from 20 to 35 years, voluntarily participated in the study. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signals of the participants are recorded, while listening to different music tracks by using a four-channel MUSE headband. Participants are asked to subjectively report their stress level using the state and trait anxiety questionnaire. The English music tracks used in this study are categorized into four genres i.e., rock, metal, electronic, and rap. The Urdu music tracks consist of five genres i.e., famous, patriotic, melodious, qawali, and ghazal. Five groups of features including absolute power, relative power, coherence, phase lag, and amplitude asymmetry are extracted from the preprocessed EEG signals of four channels and five bands, which are used by the classifier for stress classification. Four classifier algorithms namely sequential minimal optimization, stochastic decent gradient, logistic regression (LR), and multilayer perceptron are used to classify the subject's stress level into two and three classes. It is observed that LR performs well in identifying stress with the highest reported accuracy of 98.76% and 95.06% for two- and three-level classification respectively. For understanding gender, language, and genre related discriminations in stress, a t-test and one-way analysis of variance is used. It is evident from results that English music tracks have more influence on stress level reduction as compared to Urdu music tracks. Among the genres of both languages, a noticeable difference is not found. Moreover, significant difference is found in the scores reported by females as compared to males. This indicates that the stress behavior of females is more sensitive to music as compared to males. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adult; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Music; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult; Classification (of information); Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Feature extraction; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Accurate measurement; Classifier algorithms; Human stress; Logistic regressions; Music; Sequential minimal optimization; State trait anxiety inventory (STAI); Stress classifications; adult; Article; auditory stimulation; electroencephalography; female; functional connectivity; human; human experiment; language; logistic regression analysis; male; music; normal human; perceptron; priority journal; questionnaire; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; stress; Urdu; classification; devices; electroencephalography; mental stress; music; procedures; psychology; signal processing; young adult; Biomedical signal processing","Classification; Electroencephalography (EEG); Feature extraction; Human stress; Music; State trait anxiety inventory (STAI)","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Comput.

Little work has addressed how collective action among college women emerges in the context of their lives. Based on data from 20 interviews with U.S. college women and using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), we developed a model that describes the process of mobilizing and maintaining engagement in collective action among college women and identifies the obstacles that they experience. Our findings extend prior research documenting the important roles of college women’s personal, social, and cultural life experiences in self-identification and collective action and describe additional obstacles and mechanisms of collective action. Researchers and activists alike could use the developed model to design strategies for mobilizing and sustaining activism among college women on behalf of all women. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; female; feminism; gender identity; human; human experiment; interview; male; personal experience; women's rights","Collective action; College women; Feminist; Gender identity; Gender inequality; Women’s movement; Women’s rights","","","","Springer","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Opposition to such practices has been met by attempts to discredit critics and reasserted clinical authority over the bodies of women and men with “disorders of sex development.” However, claims of clinical consensus have been selectively constructed and applied and lack evidence. Limited transparency and lack of access to justice have helped to perpetuate forced interventions. At the same time, associated with the diffusion of distinct concepts of sex and gender, intersex has been constructed as a third legal sex classification, accompanied by pious hopes and unwarranted expectations of consequences. The existence of intersex has also been instrumentalized for the benefit of other, intersecting, populations. The creation of gender categories associated with intersex bodies has created profound risks: a paradoxically narrowed and normative gender binary, maintenance of medical authority over the bodies of “disordered” females and males, and claims that transgressions of social roles ascribed to a third gender are deceptive. Claims that medicalization saves intersex people from “othering,” or that legal othering saves intersex people from medicalization, are contradictory and empty rhetoric. In practice, intersex bodies remain “normalized” or eliminated by medicine, while society and the law “others” intersex identities. That is, medicine constructs intersex bodies as either female or male, while law and society construct intersex identities as neither female nor male. Australian attempts at reforms to recognize the rights of intersex people have either failed to adequately comprehend the population affected or lacked implementation. An emerging human rights consensus demands an end to social prejudice, stigma, and forced medical interventions, focusing on the right to bodily integrity and principles of self-determination. © 2018, Journal of Bioethical Inquiry Pty Ltd.","Australia; Disorders of Sex Development; Female; Human Rights; Humans; Male; Public Policy; Australia; disorder of sex development; female; human; human rights; male; psychology; public policy","17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3; Discrimination; Disorders of sex development; Health policy; Human rights; Intersex","","","","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","English","J.

In the recent years, there has been a major uproar surrounding the rights of transgender individuals; concurrently, our country is witnessing a shift in the ways in which individuals understand their gender outside of the binary male and female classification. While the word transgender can serve as an “umbrella term encompassing a wide array of identities,” transgender rights have steadily grown across numerous areas (Buck, 2016, p. 465). However, there have been contentious legal issues that have put transgender individuals’ rights in the spotlight. The author examines Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Fourteenth Amendment. Additionally, the sociocultural risk factors, mental health issues, and medical concerns that transgender individuals face are examined. An ethical analysis is conducted to better understand the ethical quagmire of bathroom, locker room, and employment discrimination for transgender individuals. Lastly, four legal cases are expounded upon: Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989), Johnston v. University of Pittsburgh of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education (2015), G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board (2016), and Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District (2017). While enormous progress has been made, transgender people continue to traverse many complex systems in order to navigate everyday life. As we witness evolving social and legal strides for transgender individuals, further legislation involving transgender rights is warranted. Implications for social work practice are discussed. © 2020, Western Michigan University.

Trans identities and experiences have long been pathologized. Pathologization is a form of structural stigma. In many countries, including Italy, having a trans-related mental health diagnosis is still a requisite for having one gender and name changed in identity documents and for accessing gender-affirming treat-ments, even though important changes are taking place, with the WHO’s International Classification of Diseases - ICD-11 - erasing trans-related diagnosis from the “Mental and behavioral disorders” and substituting them with the cate-gory of gender incongruence in the new chapter “Conditions related to sexual health”. Trans people face social and famil-ial rejection, as well as discrimination in housing, employ-ment, education, and social services. Those intersecting forms of oppression and discrimination have a negative effect on their health. Trans people often experience overt discrimination and hostility in healthcare settings and face structural and interpersonal barriers in the access to general and gender-affirming healthcare. While trans people are as concerned as their cisgender counterparts by the need for sexual and reproductive health services, they face multiple barriers in accessing them. More research conducted as part of a meaningful collaboration with community stake-holders and organizations is needed on important areas of trans people’s general health, as well as on the optimal con-tent and models of service provision. © 2019, Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

Methods The clinical data of 747 patients with ureteral calculi who were admitted from June 2013 to December 2015 in Affiliated Nanhai Hospital of Southern Medical University were selected and included in the development group, while 317 ureteral calculi patients who were admitted from January 2016 to December 2016 were included in the validation group. The independent risk factors of ureteral calculi associated with urosepsis were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The corresponding nomogram prediction model was drawn according to the regression coefficients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves and the GiViTI calibration belts were used to estimate the discrimination and calibration of the prediction model, respectively. Results Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the five risk factors of gender, mean computed tomography(CT) attenuation value of hydronephrosis, functional solitary kidney, urine white blood cell(WBC) count and urine nitrite were independent risk factors of ureteral calculi associated with urosepsis. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the development group and validation group were 0.913 and 0.874 respectively, suggesting that the new prediction model had good discrimination capacity. P-values of the GiViTI calibration test of the two groups were 0.247 and 0.176 respectively, and the 95% CIs of GiViTI calibration belt in both groups did not cross the diagonal bisector line. Therefore the predicted probability of the model was consistent with the actual probability which suggested that the calibration of the prediction model in both groups were perfect and prediction model had strong concordance performance. Conclusion The individualized prediction model for patients with ureteral calculi can facilitate improved screening and early identification of patients having higher risk of urosepsis. © 2018 Hu et al.

We have identified clinical or biological characteristics to help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other RVs. Methods We used a prospective cohort including all consecutive patients admitted through the emergency department’s (ED) and presenting respiratory symptoms from November 2019 to April 2020. Patients were tested for RV using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Results 203/508 patients were positive for an RV during the non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period (November to February), and 268/596 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (March to April). Younger age, male gender, fever, absence of expectoration and absence of chronic lung disease were statistically associated with SARSCoV-2 detection. Combining these variables allowed for the distinguishing of SARS-CoV-2 infections with 83, 65, 75 and 76% sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, respectively. Conclusion Patients’ characteristics associated with a positive PCR are common between SARS-CoV-2 and other RVs, but a simple discrimination of strong SARS-CoV-2 suspicion with a limited set of clinical features seems possible. Such scoring could be useful but has to be prospectively evaluated and will not eliminate the need for rapid PCR assays. © 2020 Bouzid et al.

In this article we argue that disadvantage is more due to gendered behavior than to categorical discrimination: women are at a disadvantage because of what they do, rather than because of who they are. Using data on entire careers of users from GitHub.com, we develop a measure to capture the gendered pattern of behavior: We use a random forest prediction of being female (as opposed to being male) by behavioral choices in the level of activity, specialization in programming languages, and choice of partners. We test differences in success and survival along both categorical gender and the gendered pattern of behavior. We find that 84.5% of women’s disadvantage (compared to men) in success and 34.8% of their disadvantage in survival are due to the female pattern of their behavior. Men are also disadvantaged along their interquartile range of the female pattern of their behavior, and users who don’t reveal their gender suffer an even more drastic disadvantage in survival probability. Moreover, we do not see evidence for any reduction of these inequalities in time. Our findings are robust to noise in gender recognition, and to taking into account particular programming languages, or decision tree classes of gendered behavior.

Design A prospective single-center longitudinal cohort study. Patients were assessed at 6 weeks and 12 months post-injury. Methods Patients that presented at the emergency department with an acute traumatic injury, were prompted for participation. Patients that completed the assessments at 6 weeks and 12 months post injury were included. Exclusion criteria: age < 18, age > 65, pathologic fractures, injuries that resulted in severe neurologic deficits. The predicted outcome, functional recovery, was defined as a Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA-NL) Problems with Daily Activities (PDA) subscale 12.2 points at 12 months post-injury (Dutch population norm). Predictors were: gender, age, living with partner, number of chronic health conditions, SMFA-NL PDA score 6 weeks post-injury, ICU admission, length of stay in hospital, injury severity score, occurrence of complications and treatment type. All predictors were obtained before 6 weeks post-injury. Missing data were multiply imputed. Predictor variables were selected using backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were used to evaluate calibration. Bootstrap resampling was used to internally validate the final model. Results A total of 246 patients were included, of which 104 (44%) showed functional recovery. The predictors in the final PRO-Trauma model were: living with partner, the number of chronic health conditions, SMFA-NL PDA subscale score at 6 weeks post-injury and length of stay in hospital. The apparent R                             2                              was 0.33 [0.33;0.34], the c-statistic was 0.79 [0.79;0.80]. Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated good calibration (p = 0.92). Optimism-corrected R                             2                              was 0.28 [0.27;0.29] and the optimism-corrected Area Under the Curve was 0.77 [0.77;0.77]. Conclusion The PRO-Trauma prediction model can be used to obtain valid predictions of attaining functional recovery after trauma at 12 months post-injury. The PRO-Trauma prediction model showed acceptable calibration and discrimination.                          © 2019 de Graaf et al.

Research purpose: The purpose is to hear the voices of employees of different social-cultural, racial and gender backgrounds on the experiences of EE in contemporary South African organisations. Motivation for the study: Research suggests that South African organisations are pressurised to redress past racial inequality. Understanding employees’ subjective experiences of EE adds value to the debate and provides the reader with an in-depth contemporary image of EE in post-apartheid South African organisations. Research approach/design and method: A hermeneutic phenomenological approach, within the qualitative interpretive paradigm, yielded in-depth, rich and detailed descriptions of employees’ experiences of EE in both the private and public sectors of the South African workplace. Main findings: Findings show five themes that are associated with experiences of EE within South African organisations. This study highlights differences of experiences regarding EE plans and processes based on racial background, gender and age, as well as on historical socio-cultural and racial classifications of being a member of advantaged and disadvantaged groups. The following findings are highlighted: the insight into the experiences of EE from the perspectives of the ‘born-frees’ (the differences in experiences of different age groups of employees) and the experienced discrimination of black male and female employees regarding race and the experiences of gender-based discrimination being described by black and white male employees. Practical/managerial implications: Findings show the focus of experiences of EE, the conflicting issues and what South African organisations need to focus on in terms of human resources management (HRM) and the development of employee relations across racial and gender divides. It shows which topics need to be addressed in employee development and training programmes to manage diversity constructively and effectively. Contribution/value-add: The findings can be used by human resources managers to: (1) monitor the progress towards EE competently and vigorously, (2) create awareness and communication within individuals, organisations and society regarding EE, (3) create best practices in order to benefit from EE (members of all racial, gender, cultural groups), (4) create a discourse on humanistic and reflexive HRM, and(5) implement consulting, training and development programmes in organisations that are strategically, sustainably and long-term orientated.

An important characteristic of a trustworthy AI system is the absence of algorithmic bias. 'Individual discrimination' exists when a given individual different from another only in 'protected attributes' (e.g., age, gender, race, etc.) receives a different decision outcome from a given machine learning (ML) model as compared to the other individual. The current work addresses the problem of detecting the presence of individual discrimination in given ML models. Detection of individual discrimination is test-intensive in a black-box setting, which is not feasible for non-trivial systems. We propose a methodology for auto-generation of test inputs, for the task of detecting individual discrimination. Our approach combines two well-established techniques - symbolic execution and local explainability for effective test case generation. We empirically show that our approach to generate test cases is very effective as compared to the best-known benchmark systems that we examine. © 2019 ACM.","Machine learning; Model checking; Auto generations; Decision outcome; Individual Discrimination; Local Explainability; Machine learning models; Symbolic execution; Test case generation; Well-established techniques; Black-box testing","Fairness Testing; Individual Discrimination; Local Explainability; Symbolic Execution","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","27th ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, ESEC/FSE 2019","150532","Tallinn","26 August 2019 through 30 August 2019","ACM SIGSOFT","English","ESEC/FSE - Proc.

Existing approaches consider the posts individually and predict their emotions independently. Different from previous researches, we explore the dependence among relevant posts via the authors' backgrounds, since the authors with similar backgrounds, e.g., gender, location, tend to express similar emotions. However, such personal attributes are not easy to obtain in most social media websites, and it is hard to capture attributes-aware words to connect similar people. Accordingly, we propose a Neural Personal Discrimination (NPD) approach to address above challenges by determining personal attributes from posts, and connecting relevant posts with similar attributes to jointly learn their emotions. In particular, we employ adversarial discriminators to determine the personal attributes, with attention mechanisms to aggregate attributes-aware words. In this way, social correlationship among different posts can be better addressed. Experimental results show the usefulness of personal attributes, and the effectiveness of our proposed NPD approach in capturing such personal attributes with significant gains over the state-of-the-art models. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics","Product development; Social networking (online); Attention mechanisms; Emotion detection; Personal attributes; Social media; Social media websites; State of the art; Natural language processing systems","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61525205, 61702518, 61806137); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD","Association for Computational Linguistics","2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019","159367","Hong Kong","3 November 2019 through 7 November 2019","Apple; ASAPP; et al.; Facebook; Google; salesforce","English","EMNLP-IJCNLP - Conf.

Theorizing from social, cognitive, and evolutionary psychology suggests that beyond attitudes, discrimination against transgender people may derive from folk theories about what gender is and where it comes from. Transgender identity is met with hostility, in part, because it poses a challenge to the lay view that gender is determined at birth, and based on observable physical and behavioral characteristics. Here, in two pre-registered studies (N = 1323), we asked American adults to indicate the gender of a transgender target who either altered their biology through surgical interventions or altered their outward appearance: to what extent is it their birth-assigned gender or their self-identified gender? Responses correlate strongly with affect toward transgender people, measured by feeling thermometers, yet predict views on transgender people's right to use their preferred bathrooms above and beyond feelings. Compared to male participants, female participants judge the person's gender more in line with the self-identified gender than the birth-assigned gender. This is consistent with social and psychological theories that posit high status (e.g., men) and low status (e.g., women) members of social classification systems view group hierarchies in more and less essentialist ways respectively. Gender differences in gender category beliefs decrease with religiosity and conservatism, and are smaller in higher age groups. These results suggest that folk theories of gender, or beliefs about what gender is and how it is determined have a unique role in how transgender people are viewed and treated. Moreover, as evident by the demographic variability of gender category beliefs, folk theories are shaped by social and cultural forces and are amenable to interventions. They offer an alternative pathway to measure policy support and possibly change attitude toward transgender people. © 2019 Rad et al.

Four main results are established, using a range of estimators, including OLS, interval regression, and quantile regression: (1) the presence of a substantively large gender income gap (favoring males) in all six countries; (2) some evidence of a gender-related glass ceiling in some of these countries; (3) some evidence that endowments diminish the income gaps, while the returns to characteristics increase the gaps; and (4) while observed individual characteristics explain a part of the gaps, a substantial part of the income gap is left unexplained. In sum, these results are consistent with the presence of income discrimination towards females but at the same time also point towards the importance of continued attention towards institutions and economic policy for decreasing the gender income gap in these former formally gender neutral economies—notably through attention towards the maternity and paternity leave system, as well as public provision of child care.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish a simple nomogram model to identify the determinants of hypertension in patients with T2DM and to quickly calculate the probability of hypertension in individuals with T2DM. Materials and methods: A total of 643,439 subjects participating in the national physical examination has been recruited in this cross-sectional study. After excluding unqualified subjects, 30,507 adults with T2DM were included in the final analysis. 21,355 and 9,152 subjects were randomly assigned to the model developing group and validation group, respectively, with a ratio of 7:3. The potential risk factors used in this study to assess hypertension in patients with T2DM included questionnaire investigation and physical measurement variables. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models to optimize feature selection, and the multivariable logistic regression analysis was for predicting model. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using the receiver operating curve (ROC) and calibration curve. Results: The results showed that the major determinants of hypertension in patients with T2DM were age, gender, drinking, exercise, smoking, obesity and atherosclerotic vascular disease. The area under ROC curve of developing group and validation group are both 0.814, indicating that the prediction model owns high disease recognition ability. The p values of the two calibration curves are 0.625 and 0.445, suggesting that the nomogram gives good calibration. Conclusion: The individualized nomogram model can facilitate improved screening and early identification of patients with hypertension in T2DM. This procedure will be useful in developing regions with high epidemiological risk and poor socioeconomic status just like Urumqi, in Northern China. Copyright: © 2020 Xue et al.

Medical image recognition has been mainly for detection of diseases or symptoms. In recent years, there is a hypothesis which human health conditions and personal attributes affect brain structure. Most studies focus on T1-weighted images, however T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images are also used in medical practice. Diffusion images contains signals and information which are possibly used to discriminate human health or other state rather and are different from T1-weighted or T2-weighted images. Some studies using 3D-CNN (3-dimensional convolutional neural network) have been applied for brain structural magnetic resonance imaging such as T1-weighted images, but diffusion tensor images cannot be directly input to 3D-CNN because their data is represented as the tensor of the movement of water molecules. Therefore, in this research, we propose 3D-CNN which input the diffusion images of each direction to different channel. We construct multi-channel 3D-CNN and verify the effect of brain structure image mode on gender discrimination using T1, T2, and DTI. © 2020 IEEE.","Convolutional neural networks; Diffusion; Image recognition; Intelligent computing; Intelligent systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Molecules; Soft computing; Tensors; 3-dimensional; Brain structure; Diffusion weighted images; Gender discrimination; Medical practice; Multi channel; Personal attributes; Water molecule; Diffusion tensor imaging","Deep neural network; Diffusion tensor imaging; Gender discrimination; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Joint 11th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems and 21st International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems, SCIS-ISIS 2020","166710","Virtual, Tokyo","5 December 2020 through 8 December 2020","","English","Jt.

Numerous studies support a role of facial mimicry in recognizing others’ emotions. However, the underlying functional mechanism is unclear. A prominent hypothesis considers facial mimicry as based on an action-perception loop, leading to the prediction that facial mimicry should be observed only when processing others’ facial expressions. Nevertheless, previous studies have also detected facial mimicry during observation of emotional bodily expressions. An emergent alternative hypothesis is that facial mimicry overtly reflects the simulation of an “emotion”, rather than the reproduction of a specific observed motor pattern. In the present study, we tested whether blocking mimicry (“Bite”) on the lower face disrupted recognition of happy expressions conveyed by either facial or body expressions. In Experiment 1, we tested participants’ ability to identify happy, fearful and neutral expressions in the Bite condition and in two control conditions. In Experiment 2, to ensure that such a manipulation selectively affects emotion recognition, we tested participants’ ability to recognize emotional expressions, as well as the actors’ gender, under the Bite condition and a control condition. Finally, we investigated the relationship between dispositional empathy and emotion recognition under the condition of blocked mimicry. Our findings demonstrated that blocking mimicry on the lower face hindered recognition of happy facial and body expressions, while the recognition of neutral and fearful expressions was not affected by the mimicry manipulation. The mimicry manipulation did not affect the gender discrimination task. Furthermore, the impairment of happy expression recognition correlated with empathic traits. These results support the role of facial mimicry in emotion recognition and suggest that facial mimicry reflects a global sensorimotor simulation of others’ emotions rather than a muscle-specific reproduction of an observed motor expression. © 2020 Borgomaneri et al.

This affects female soccer players' self-confidence negatively and contributes to an undeservedly negative image of women's soccer. In the present paper, we argue that most differences between men's and women's soccer can be explained by women having to adapt to rules and regulations that are suited for men and their physical attributes. Thus, games are much more demanding for women. Furthermore, we argue that if men had to play with a degree of adaptation similar to that which women do today, they would have to alter their style of play radically. As support for our argument, we scale game demands for male and female soccer players according to anthropometric and physiological differences in order to highlight the differences, and use these to predict what would be the most appropriate adaptations. Finally, we show that our predictions are largely supported by the scarce pool of comparable data across the sexes. © 2019 Pedersen, Aksdal and Stalsberg.","","Biological differences; Discrimination; Football; Gender; Stereotypes","","","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","English","Front.

The framework employs five analytical steps: 1) preparation of an ‘international legal frame’ to underline ‘gender’ and ‘integration’ needs at workplaces, 2) preparation of a ‘national legal frame’ to examine if existing legislation incorporates identified ‘gender’ and ‘integration’ needs, 3) compilation of subjective experiences of women migrants relating to discriminatory practices at workplaces, 4) interpretation of expert's perspectives towards missing legal clauses and existing barriers to implementation, and 5) classification of legislation with respect to their gender- as well as integration-responsiveness. The findings reveal that the prevailing legislation do incorporate ‘gender’ to some extent, but neglect ‘integration’ to a large extent and thus offer partial protection to women migrants against discriminatory practices at workplaces. The Swedish legislation appear more gender- as well as integration-sensitive on selected needs than that of Germany. The inferences underline a dire need to conduct proper ‘gender’ as well as ‘integration’ analysis of relevant legislation to ensure smooth economic integration of women migrants in both countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Germany; Sweden; analytical framework; conceptual framework; economic integration; gender discrimination; legislation; migrant worker; workplace","Discrimination; Gender; Legislation; Mainstreaming; Migrant; Workplace","","","Fritz Thyssen Stiftung, (40.17.0.012PO)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Women's Stud.

Identifying as a racial/ethnic minority and sexual minority (SM) or gender minority (GM) may lead to greater stress/discrimination and psychopathology. We examined nonsuicidal self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts (i.e., self-injurious thoughts and behaviors [SITBs]) and depressive symptoms across intersections of sexual orientation, gender, and race/ethnicity. Method: Study participants consisted of a large (n = 2,948; 59% GM) sample of adolescents aged 14-18 who were recruited online to complete a cross-sectional survey. SGM status, race/ethnicity, and their interactions were used to predict depressive symptoms and SITBs. Associations among race/ethnicity and GM-specific psychosocial factors were assessed. Results: SM (B = 3.75) and GM (B = 8.81) participants reported higher depressive symptoms and SITB histories (odds ratios [ORs] from 1.92 to 2.43 and 2.87 to 5.44, respectively). Asian participants were less likely to report nonsuicidal self-injury (OR = 0.45), and Latinx participants were more likely to report suicide attempts (OR = 1.50). Although omnibus tests of interactions were largely insignificant, exploratory analyses revealed fewer depressive symptoms (B=-8.40) and SITBs (ORs from -0.95 to -2.05) among Black SM participants and, at times, Black GM participants. This protective effect may relate to lower self-reported expectations of rejection due to gender. Conclusions: GM participants reported the highest risk for depressive symptoms and SITBs. Contrary to hypotheses, multiple minority identification was not associated with greater psychopathology. Future research, assessing specific sexual and gender identities across diverse samples, is needed to highlight how race affects psychopathology risk across these identities. © 2020 American Psychological Association.","Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Minority Groups; Self-Injurious Behavior; Sexual and Gender Minorities; adolescent; automutilation; cross-sectional study; depression; ethnic group; female; human; male; minority group; sexual and gender minority","Adolescence; Gender minority; Nonsuicidal self-injury; Sexual minority; Suicidal self-injury","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (T32MH018951)","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","J.

First, we present analyses using data from the 2016 pilot survey of the American National Election Survey (ANES) showing how men and women differ in their attitudes toward transgender people as measured by thermometer ratings toward transgender people and questions about perceptions of whether they are victims of discrimination. Next, we describe our randomized laboratory experiment, testing three hypotheses/predictions: (a) that men are less supportive of transgender people and rights than women are, (2) that threatening a man’s masculinity increases opposition to transgender rights whereas threatening a woman’s femininity has no effect, and (3) that this effect will be stronger among men who report that their gender identity is very important to them. Consistent with existing scholarship, we find that women are more supportive of transgender rights compared to men. More importantly, we also find that threatened masculinity is an even better predictor of opposition to transgender rights than gender identity. In short, we find that attitudes toward transgender people and rights are closely linked with the way people think and feel about their own gender identity and expectations of gender performance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Bem Sex Role Inventory; BSRI; Gender; Gender identity; LGBT; Masculinity; Political psychology; Public opinion; Threat; Transgender; Transgender rights","","","","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Twenty-five studies were identified which investigated the role of racial and ethnic identity and gender for minority groups and how marginalization may be associated with differential outcomes in depression symptomology. The results showed substantial variability in whether studies intentionally operationalized intersectionality through theoretical frameworks, study design, sampling, and analyses. Studies were rated on a scale of 1 through 5; those with scores of 3 or higher were included in the review. A rating of 5 indicated studies had explicitly used an intersectional theoretical framework, integrating the process of racial/ethnic identity development and gender socialization during adolescence. Three studies met the criteria for 5, one study was rated 4, and 21 studies were rated 3. Attention to experiences with discrimination was common throughout.

To study the effects of these changes, we analyze the changing profiles of economists who have won competitions for full professorship in the last few decades in the country. We concentrate on individual characteristics and on scientific production. We show that the identification of a univocal and standardized concept of research quality within the new research assessments has progressively imposed a strategy of homologation, especially for women. We find that women economists are at a higher risk of discrimination than their male colleagues and thus they are more likely to conform their research activities to the standardized profile imposed by the gender-blind application of simplistic bibliometric methods. © 2020 The Author(s).

To test this, we collected data on olfactory abilities using the Sniffin' Sticks and odor awareness with Children's Olfactory Behaviors in Everyday Life Questionnaire in 153 preschool children and retested them one and a half year later. Parents completed an inventory on children's exposure to a variety of odors and on their own odor awareness using the Odor Awareness Scale. We controlled for the effects of age and verbal fluency on the children's performance. We found that the children's odor identification and discrimination scores differed as a function of parental odor awareness. Although these effects were rather small, they were commensurate in size with those of gender and age. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to present evidence that diversity in children's olfactory environment affects variation in their olfactory abilities and odor awareness.

The results show that hyperspectral signatures are similar between male and female subjects for the cheek, forehead, and hair ROIs. Furthermore, this study investigated whether the hyperspectral face signatures from the ROIs contained discriminative information for gender classification.

The commentary authors applaud Dyrbye and her coauthors for their innovative approach; their findings provide substantial insights relevant to the critical goal of enhancing medical student well-being. However, evidence indicates that students who identify as members of racial, ethnic, sexual, and/or gender minority groups are at heightened risk of depression, so any program that profiles students in relation to their mental health symptoms must be proactive in ensuring that its efforts do not perpetuate stigma, marginalization, and discrimination for these underrepresented and potentially vulnerable groups.

However, the most widely used and current NIMH-recommended task for assessing MSU - the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET) - suffers from potential assessment issues, including reliance on a participant's vocabulary/intelligence and the use of culturally biased stimuli. Here, we evaluate the impact of demographic and sociocultural factors (age, gender, education, ethnicity, race) on the RMET and other social and non-social cognitive tasks in an effort to determine the extent to which the RMET may be unduly influenced by participant characteristics.Methods In total, 40 248 international, native-/primarily English-speaking participants between the ages of 10 and 70 completed one of five measures on TestMyBrain.org: RMET, a shortened version of RMET, a multiracial emotion identification task, an emotion discrimination task, and a non-social/non-verbal processing speed task (digit symbol matching).Results Contrary to other tasks, performance on the RMET increased across the lifespan. Education, race, and ethnicity explained more variance in RMET performance than the other tasks, and differences between levels of education, race, and ethnicity were more pronounced for the RMET than the other tasks such that more highly educated, non-Hispanic, and White/Caucasian individuals performed best.Conclusions These data suggest that the RMET may be unduly influenced by social class and culture, posing a serious challenge to assessing MSU in clinical populations given shared variance between social status and psychiatric illness.

Women scientists in STEM, due to their underrepresentation, embody a critical point for the whole research system. This is broadly considered as the result of cultural embedded unconscious bias that affects female professional career paths and strongly interacts with the role identity and self-efficacy. This is true also among research organisations, which indirectly reproduce the traditional job role division considering women closer to family-care responsibilities and men more suitable in performing at high-level positions. Traditional culture, seen as male-centred, defines particular ways of doing science as well as particular ways of doing gender. Gender awareness is considered as one of the powerful instrument to overcome traditional unconscious bias and stereotypes and to get away with the discriminatory attitudes and abuse of power. A qualitative case study carried out on female researchers in STEM working at the Italian National Research Council provides findings about the relation between gender awareness and self-efficacy. In this paper some evidences from the CNR case study are provided as well as a conceptual attempt classification of gender-based discrimination. © 2019, Padova University Press.

As brain structure is the fundament of its function, getting insight into structural brain may help us to better understand the functional mechanism of gender difference. Previous structural studies of gender difference in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) usually focused on gray matter (GM) concentration and structural connectivity (SC), leaving cortical morphology not characterized properly. In this study a large dataset is used to explore whether cortical three-dimensional (3-D) morphology can offer enough discriminative morphological features to effectively identify gender. Data of all available healthy controls (N = 1113) from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) were utilized. We suggested a multivariate pattern analysis method called Hierarchical Sparse Representation Classifier (HSRC) and got an accuracy of 96.77% for gender identification. Permutation tests were used to testify the reliability of gender discrimination (p < 0.001). Cortical 3-D morphological features within the frontal lobe were found the most important contributors to gender difference of human brain morphology. Moreover, we investigated gender discriminative ability of cortical 3-D morphology in predefined Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) and Resting-State Networks (RSN) templates, and found the superior frontal gyrus the most discriminative in AAL and the default mode network the most discriminative in RSN. Gender difference of surface-based morphology was also discussed. The frontal lobe, as well as the default mode network, was widely reported of gender difference in previous structural and functional MRI studies, which suggested that morphology indeed affect human brain function. Our study indicates that gender can be identified on individual level by using cortical 3-D morphology and offers a new approach for structural MRI research, as well as highlights the importance of gender balance in brain imaging studies. © 2019 Luo, Hou, Wang and Hu.","adult; anatomical automatic labeling; Article; automated pattern recognition; brain cortex; classifier; connectome; controlled study; default mode network; female; frontal lobe; hierarchical sparse representation classifier; human; image analysis; imaging and display; male; measurement accuracy; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; resting state network; sex determination; sex difference; superior frontal gyrus; three dimensional imaging","Cortical three-dimensional morphology; Gender difference; Hierarchical sparse representation classifier; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate pattern analysis","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61420106001)","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","English","Front.

Factors that increase self-group distancing have been identified (e.g., existing discrimination and low group identification), but it is unknown how self-group distancing by an ingroup leader is perceived by and affects subordinates of the negatively stereotyped group. In the current study, female participants received ambiguous negative feedback from a male versus female leader displaying queen bee-type versus neutral behavior. As expected, a male leader displaying queen bee-type behavior was seen as having less positive intent than a male leader displaying neutral behavior, which in turn increased how sexist he was perceived to be. A female leader displaying queen bee (vs. neutral) behavior was not seen as having less positive intent, which thus did not indirectly influence perceived sexism. Behavior of both male and female leaders did affect junior women: participants exposed to a leader displaying queen bee-type behavior reported more anger, sadness, and anxiety than participants exposed to a leader displaying neutral behavior. These data provide further evidence that simply adding more women or minorities in key senior positions is insufficient to change inequality if bias in the organization is not tackled.

Therefore, it is essential to explore the factors that might affect psychological distress among PWPD. The current study assesses the association between demographic factors (gender, education, and employment status), health- and disability-related factors (type of disability, visibility of the disability, disability duration, and self-rated health), and psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived social support), and psychological distress among PWPD in Israel. Design: The data were collected through structured questionnaires administered to a sample of 433 PWPD. Results: The findings suggest negative associations between education, employment status, duration of disability, self-rated health, and perceived social support, and psychological distress among PWPD. In addition, the findings indicate a positive association between perceived discrimination and psychological distress. No association was found between gender, type of disability, and visibility of the disability, and psychological distress. Conclusions and Implications: PWPD who are unemployed, less educated, with a shorter duration of disability and lower self-rated health, as well as those who feel more discriminated against and less social support, are more likely to experience higher levels of psychological distress. Therefore, it is important to raise PWPD's awareness of their rights and of the social possibilities and services available to them, to provide them with mental help, to engage in extensive social activities aimed at providing resources to PWPD, and to act to eliminate discrimination. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Adult; Disabled Persons; Educational Status; Employment; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Israel; Male; Quality of Life; Sex Factors; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; Article; controlled study; demography; disease association; disease classification; disease duration; disease severity; distress syndrome; education; employment status; female; gender; human; information processing; Israel; major clinical study; male; mental health; people with physical disability; perceptive discrimination; physical disability; psychological aspect; psychosocial rehabilitation; questionnaire; risk factor; self concept; self rated health; social support; disabled person; educational status; employment; epidemiology; health survey; mental stress; psychology; quality of life; sex factor; statistics and numerical data","Israel; People with physical disabilities; Psychological distress","","","Israeli government; Ministry of Welfare and Social Services; Israel National Insurance Institute","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Rehabil.

To identify discriminatory practices in the workplace, job advertisement analysis was used by previous studies. However, most of those studies adopted content analysis by manually coding the text from a limited number of samples since working with a large scale of job advertisements consisting of unstructured text data is very challenging. Encountering those limitations, the present study involves text mining techniques to identify multiple types of direct discrimination on a large scale of online job advertisements by designing a method called Direct Discrimination Detection (DDD). The DDD is constructed using a combination of N-grams and regular expressions (regex) with the exact match principle of a Boolean retrieval model. A total of 8,969 online job advertisements in English and Bahasa Indonesia, published from May 2005 to December 2017 were collected from bursakerja-jateng.com as the data. The results reveal that the practices of direct discrimination still exist during the job-hunting process including gender, marital status, physical appearances, and religion. The most recurrent type of discrimination which occurs in job advertisements is based on age (66.27%), followed by gender (38.76%), and physical appearances (18.42%). Additionally, female job seekers are found as the most vulnerable party to experience direct discrimination during recruitment. The results exhibit female job seekers face complex jeopardy in particular job positions comparing to their male counterparts. Not only excluded because of their gender, but female job seekers also had to fulfil more requirements for getting an opportunity to apply for the jobs such as being single, still at a young age, complying specific physical appearances and particular religious preferences. This study illustrates the power and potential of optimizing computational methods on a large scale of unstructured text data to analyze phenomena in the social field. © 2020 Ningrum et al.

The Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) is among the most frequently used instruments to assess perceptions of discrimination in general, as well as specific types of discrimination (e.g., based on race/ethnicity or age). While numerous studies attest to its validity and reliability for racial/ethnic minority groups, no existing study has examined its psychometric equivalence across gender, age, or socio-economic groups. This study fills this gap. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that because social hierarchies of race/ethnicity, age, gender and class have different histories and are differently organized and institutionalized in contemporary United States, racial/ethnic, age, gender, and education-based groups differ in the types of discrimination they experience and perceive. As a result, the EDS may not be equivalent across these social groups. Method: We test this hypothesis by analyzing data from the 2015 US Texas Diversity Study (N=1,049), a telephone survey of English- and Spanish-speaking adults. We examine two forms of the EDS – one focusing on discrimination regardless of attribution and one focusing specifically on discrimination attributed to respondents’ race/ethnicity. Results: Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses revealed that neither version of the scale generates estimates of discrimination that can be meaningfully compared across all racial/ethnic, age, gender, and education-based groups. Conclusions: Our results urge caution when drawing comparisons of perceived discrimination across diverse social groups based on the EDS and point to avenues for future scale development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Psychometrics; Racism; Reproducibility of Results; Social Discrimination; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Texas; United States; United States; age structure; ethnic minority; ethnicity; gender role; measurement method; racism; adult; article; drawing; education; ethnicity; factor analysis; female; gender; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; psychometry; racism; social hierarchy; social status; speech; telephone interview; Texas; classification; devices; middle aged; perception; procedures; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; racism; reproducibility; social discrimination; social support; Texas; United States","Age; Bias; Gender; Psychometrics; Racism; Social Discrimination; Socio-economic Status; United States.","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (304503/2018-5)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Soc.

We have recently proposed SpeakerBeam, which exploits an adaptation utterance of the target speaker to extract his/her voice characteristics that are then used to guide a neural network towards extracting speech of that speaker. SpeakerBeam presents a practical alternative to speech separation as it enables tracking speech of a target speaker across utterances, and achieves promising speech extraction performance. However, it sometimes fails when speakers have similar voice characteristics, such as in same-gender mixtures, because it is difficult to discriminate the target speaker from the interfering speakers. In this paper, we investigate strategies for improving the speaker discrimination capability of SpeakerBeam. First, we propose a time-domain implementation of SpeakerBeam similar to that proposed for a time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), which has achieved state-of-the-art performance for speech separation. Besides, we investigate (1) the use of spatial features to better discriminate speakers when microphone array recordings are available, (2) adding an auxiliary speaker identification loss for helping to learn more discriminative voice characteristics. We show experimentally that these strategies greatly improve speech extraction performance, especially for same-gender mixtures, and outperform Tas- Net in terms of target speech extraction. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

In this sense, it is essential to promote inclusive work, as the practices of domination at work relegate to marginalization different social actors, including women and LGBTQs, causing harm to the psychosocial health of these groups. In order to contribute to this aspect, it was proposed a critical review of the productions on practices of violence and domination in the context of work aimed at the female population and LGBTQs, in order to identify the challenges in the proposition of inclusive work in Brazil. The descriptors “work” and “prejudice” or “discrimination” were used in a literature search between 1995 and 2017 in the Scielo database, which allowed the identification of 54 studies included in this review. The results pointed by the reviewed studies found violence with women and LGBTQs in the various work contexts, practiced by bosses, colleagues, clients, among other subjects. Thus, it is a challenge for the proposition of inclusive work to implement educational and assistance interventions, supported by laws and public policies that promote respect and equity to diversity as a keynote in Brazilian social organizations and work contexts. © 2019, Institute de Medicina Social da UERJ.

Typical problems with the non-binary are invisibility, vulnerability, and discrimination. Non-binary clients face particular difficulties in health care. The acknowledgement of the client's gender identification and respect for their personal suffering are of great importance for psychotherapeutic support and preparation for body modification measures.

Our research considers the impact of primary caregiver experiences of racial- and socioeconomic-based discrimination in early (age 3–5 years) and late childhood (age 9½) on adolescent disruptive behaviors (age 14) with a large sample of diverse caregiver–child dyads (N = 634). In addition, we examine the potential protective effects of parent–child relationship quality in early and late childhood in buffering the effects of caregiver discrimination on adolescent disruptive behaviors. We also explore possible gender differences in children's vulnerability to engage in disruptive behaviors in the context of caregiver experiences of discrimination. The findings from this study indicate that at trend level, early childhood experiences of primary caregiver discrimination (ages 3–5) predicted adolescent disruptive behaviors, accounting for the effects of more recent (age 9½) caregiver discrimination. In addition, parent–child relationship quality at age 9½ years was found to buffer the effects of late childhood (age 9½) primary caregiver discrimination on adolescent disruptive behaviors for both male and female youth.

During an update of this meta-analysis it became apparent that one study was erroneously entered twice. The reduced data of k = 55 studies was reanalyzed after excluding the unpublished study by Scheinberger (1993). The corrected overall effect size changed at the second decimal: d = 1.01 (95% CI [0.77, 1.25], Q = 409.73, p < .001, I² = 92.21) and g = 0.98 (95% CI [0.75, 1.22], Q = 395.49, p < .001, I² = 91.71%), k = 55, N = 3,399. This small numerical deviation is negligible and does not change the interpretation of the results. Similarly, results for categorial moderators changed only numerically but not in terms of their statistical significance or direction (see revised Table 4). In the original meta-analysis based on k = 56 studies, unpublished studies had a larger effect size than published studies. Based on k = 55 studies, this difference vanished. Results for continuous moderators also changed only numerically: Q-tests with mixed-effects models still revealed that year of publication (Q = 0.06, p = .807, k = 55) as well as gender ratio in the sample (Q = 1.28, p =.259, k = 43) had no statistically significant influence on effect size. In sum, based on the numerically corrected values our implications for practical advices and boundary conditions for the use of content-based techniques in credibility assessment are still valid. The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-21973-001.) Within the scope of judicial decisions, approaches to distinguish between true and fabricated statements have been of particular importance since ancient times. Although methods focusing on ""prototypical"" deceptive behavior (e.g., psychophysiological phenomena, nonverbal cues) have largely been rejected with regard to validity, content-based techniques constitute a promising approach and are well established within the applied forensic context. The basic idea of this approach is that experience-based and nonexperience-based statements differ in their content-related quality. In order to test the validity of the most prominent content-based techniques, criteria-based content analysis (CBCA) and reality monitoring (RM), we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis on English- and German-language studies. Based on a variety of decision criteria, 55 studies were included revealing an overall effect size of g = 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.22], Q = 395.49, p < .001, I² = 91.71%, N = 3,399). There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of CBCA and RM. Additionally, we investigated a number of moderator variables, such as characteristics of participants, statements, and judgment procedures, as well as general study characteristics. Results showed that the application of all CBCA criteria outperformed any incomplete CBCA criteria set. Furthermore, statement classification based on discriminant functions revealed higher discrimination rates than decisions based on sum scores. All results are discussed in terms of their significance for future research (e.g., developing standardized decision rules) and practical application (e.g., user training, applying complete criteria set).

In medical informatics, regular expression-based classifiers have emerged as an alternative to traditional, discriminative classification algorithms due to their ability to model sequential patterns. This article presents CREGEX (Classifier Regular Expression), a biomedical text classifier based on an automatically generated regular-expressions-based feature space. We conceived an algorithm for automatically constructing an informative and discriminative regular-expressions-based feature space, suitable for binary and multiclass discrimination problems. Regular expressions are automatically generated from training texts using a coarse-to-fine text aligning method, which trades off the lexical variants of words, in terms of gender and grammatical number, and the generation of a feature space containing a large number of noisy features. CREGEX carries out feature selection by filtering keywords and also computes a confidence metric to classify test texts. Three de-identified datasets in Spanish, with information on smoking habits, obesity, and obesity types, were used here to assess the performance of CREGEX. For comparison, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) supervised classifiers were also trained with consecutive sequences of tokens (n-grams) as features. Results show that, in all the datasets used for evaluation, CREGEX not only outperformed both the SVM and NB classifiers in terms of accuracy and F-measure (p-value<0.05) but also used a fewer amount of training examples to achieve the same performance. Such a superior performance is attributed to the regular expressions' ability to represent complex text patterns. © 2013 IEEE.","Barium compounds; Decision making; Medical informatics; Nutrition; Pattern matching; Sodium compounds; Support vector machines; Text processing; Automatically generated; Biomedical informatics; Classification algorithm; Clinical decision making; Regular expressions; Sequence alignments; Supervised classifiers; Text classification; Classification (of information)","Biomedical informatics; regular expressions; sequence alignment; text classification","","","CONICYT-PFCHA; Doctorado Nacional, (2017-21172062); UCO 1866 Project; Universidad de Concepción VRID-Enlace, (217.092.052-1.0); Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDEF, (16CTTS66390, ID19I10120)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","English","IEEE Access","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Machine-learning may offer potential to explore outcomes of even greater complexity, such as premature death. This study aimed to develop novel prediction algorithms using machine-learning, in addition to standard survival modelling, to predict premature all-cause mortality. Methods A prospective population cohort of 502,628 participants aged 40–69 years were recruited to the UK Biobank from 2006–2010 and followed-up until 2016. Participants were assessed on a range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestyle factors. Mortality data by ICD-10 were obtained from linkage to Office of National Statistics. Models were developed using deep learning, random forest and Cox regression. Calibration was assessed by comparing observed to predicted risks; and discrimination by area under the ‘receiver operating curve’ (AUC). Findings 14,418 deaths (2.9%) occurred over a total follow-up time of 3,508,454 person-years. A simple age and gender Cox model was the least predictive (AUC 0.689, 95% CI 0.681–0.699). A multivariate Cox regression model significantly improved discrimination by 6.2% (AUC 0.751, 95% CI 0.748–0.767). The application of machine-learning algorithms further improved discrimination by 3.2% using random forest (AUC 0.783, 95% CI 0.776–0.791) and 3.9% using deep learning (AUC 0.790, 95% CI 0.783–0.797). These ML algorithms improved discrimination by 9.4% and 10.1% respectively from a simple age and gender Cox regression model. Random forest and deep learning achieved similar levels of discrimination with no significant difference. Machine-learning algorithms were well-calibrated, while Cox regression models consistently over-predicted risk. Conclusions Machine-learning significantly improved accuracy of prediction of premature all-cause mortality in this middle-aged population, compared to standard methods. This study illustrates the value of machine-learning for risk prediction within a traditional epidemiological study design, and how this approach might be reported to assist scientific verification. © 2019 Weng et al.

Existing studies have discerned factors that differentiate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) victims from sexual abuse victims, yet no research has been conducted to discriminate which items in a high risk population of youth are most predictive of CSEC. Using the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) cohorts I and II, we examined responses from 1063 males and 1355 females ages 11 and older, over three interview periods. A 2-parameter logistic Item Response Theory (2 PL IRT) model was employed in order to examine item performance as potential indicators for the severity of risk for CSEC. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis was conducted in order to examine potential differences in item responses based on gender. Modeling strategies to assess item difficulty and discrimination were outlined and Item Characteristic Curves for the final retained items were presented. Evidence for uniform DIF were present within items that asked about runaway, any drug use, suicidality, and experiencing severe violence.

Few researchers, however, have studied the longitudinal relationship between discrimination and problematic alcohol use among AA male and female emerging adults. In a sample of 681 AAs aged 19–25 (51% male), we explored multiple, distinct trajectories of discrimination and sociodemographic predictors of the trajectory classifications. We also examined the relation between discrimination trajectories and problematic alcohol use and the extent to which sex modified these associations. Collectively, the findings revealed that three trajectories—high-stable, low-rising, and low-declining—characterized discrimination experiences for AA emerging adults. Males in the high-stable trajectory class reported more problematic alcohol use than males in other trajectory classes and all females. These findings lay the foundation for future research that examines gender-specific mechanisms in the discrimination–health link. © 2017 Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood and SAGE Publishing.","","alcohol use; discrimination; gender; health behavior; stress","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (5 T32 HD079350 03)","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Emerg.

Here, we sought to identify a risk score signature for survival prediction of LUAD patients. In the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, GSE18842, GSE75037, GSE101929, and GSE19188 mRNA expression profiles were downloaded to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were used to establish a protein-protein interaction network and perform clustering module analysis. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses were applied to develop and validate the gene signature based on the TCGA dataset. The signature genes were then verified on GEPIA, Oncomine, and HPA platforms. Expression levels of corresponding genes were also measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in HBE, A549, and PC-9 cell lines. The prognostic signature based on eight genes (TTK, HMMR, ASPM, CDCA8, KIF2C, CCNA2, CCNB2, and MKI67) was established, which was independent of other clinical factors. The risk model offered better discrimination between risk groups, and patients with high-risk scores tended to have poor survival rate at 1-, 3-and 5-year follow-up. The model also presented better survival prediction in cancer-specific cohorts of age, gender, clinical stage III/IV, primary tumor 1/2, and lymph node metastasis 1/2. The signature genes, moreover, were highly expressed in A549 and PC-9 cells. In conclusion, the risk score signature could be used for prognostic estimation and as an independent risk factor for survival prediction in patients with LUAD. © 2020 by the authors.

And if so, (b) what mechanisms may explain their fewer brokerage roles? Study 1, a meta-analysis examining gender differences in network brokerage, analyzed a cumulative sample of 15,743 individuals (69 independent samples) to show that women were less likely to be brokers in both instrumental and expressive networks, which partly explained their lower career success. Study 2, a follow-up study with 2 independent samples of new employees (n = 150 and 245, respectively), examined both structural opportunity (job-based opportunity and workplace discrimination) and individual agency (proactive networking) as potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between gender and network brokerage. Results of these 2 samples consistently show that proactive networking mediated gender's effect on network brokerage that was measured 6 months after the new employees entered their organizations. The predictions regarding the mediation effects of job-based opportunity and workplace discrimination were not supported. Our findings offer valuable insights into the relative positions of women and men in informal structures of organizational networks, advance our understanding of gender inequality in career outcomes, and shed new light on the relative importance of individual agency and structural opportunity in explaining individuals' occupancy of advantageous network positions. © 2020 American Psychological Association.","Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Negotiating; Organizations; Social Networking; Workplace; adult; article; career; employee; female; follow up; human; human experiment; human tissue; male; meta analysis; organization; prediction; sex difference; social network; workplace; interpersonal communication; social network; workplace","Gender; Network brokerage; Networking behavior; Social networks; Structural opportunity","","","","American Psychological Association","","","","","","English","J.

This new form of discrimination refers to a phenomenon where a business transaction is influenced by race, gender, age, or any other non-business related characteristic of providers or consumers. Existing research often tackles this problem from a socio-economic and regulatory points of view. However, the research on the design aspects of Sharing Economy software, which enable such complex sociotechnical problems to emerge online, is still underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a new perspective on digital discrimination, tackling the problem from a Requirements Engineering point of view. Specifically, we analyze a large dataset of online user feedback as well as synthesize existing literature to identify and classify pervasive discrimination concerns in the Sharing Economy market. Based on this analysis, we devise a crowd-driven domain model to represent these concerns along with their relations to the functional features and user goals of Sharing Economy platforms. This model is intended to provide requirements engineers, working on Sharing Economy software, with systematic insights into the complex types of socio-Technical problems that can emerge in the operational environments of their systems. © 2020 IEEE.","Bridges; Classification (of information); Large dataset; Requirements engineering; Business transaction; Domain model; Functional features; Online users; Operational environments; Socio-economics; Sociotechnical; User goals; Economics","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","28th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference, RE 2020","163887","Zurich","31 August 2020 through 4 September 2020","University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland; University of Zurich","English","Proc.

In geopolitical events post 9/11, adoption of the term ‘Muslim women’, especially by younger generations, has grown in an act of supra-national identification with the Muslima – Muslim female community – that crosses race, ethnicity, sects and class. This is reflective of a wider prioritisation of religion in the construction of personal identity by ethnic minorities and in particular by Muslims, understood as a response to unfair treatment, stigmatisation, and higher levels of social and economic exclusion (McGhee, 2008, Khattab, 2009). In the UK social exclusion has most impacted on sense of belonging for Muslim women (Karsen and Nazroo, 2016). Yet the professional and civic roles of Muslim women in challenging negative representations and discrimination are often overlooked, along with the personal impacts of performing this labour. This article highlights the experiences of Muslim women working in media as they attempt to build new Muslim female identities and spaces of belonging, and renegotiate their own position in the process. © 2018 The Author","United Kingdom; ethnic minority; feminism; gender disparity; Islamism; media role; social exclusion; womens employment; womens status","Belonging; Feminism; Gender; Islam; Labour; Religion","","","Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC, (AH/P014828/1); University of Manchester","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Geoforum","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, few studies have examined the association between sexual and gender minority stress and diurnal cortisol in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. The current investigation tested whether the daily experience of minority stressors is uniquely related to diurnal cortisol above and beyond general stressors. Method: One hundred and 21 sexual and gender minority young adults (aged 18–35, 54.5% female) completed initial and daily evening questionnaires for 7 consecutive days to document daily general stressors and LGBT stressors. A randomly selected subset (n = 58) also provided salivary cortisol samples at wake, 45-min postwake, 12-hr postwake, and bedtime. Results: Controlling for covariates (sex assigned at birth, wake time, bedtime, and day of the week) and general stressors, individuals who reported more LGBT stressors across the week displayed elevated cortisol levels at wake, t(491) = 9.68, p = .002 and 45-min postwake, t(492) = 6.41, p = .011, relative to individuals who reported fewer LGBT stressors. In contrast, after controlling for covariates, the frequency of general stressors only predicted cortisol 12 hr postwake, t(785) = 2.02, p = .043. Diurnal cortisol was unrelated to within-person fluctuations in LGBT and general stressors. Conclusions: Results imply that the experience of everyday minority stressors is uniquely related to diurnal cortisol and may have implications for the mental and physical health of LGBT adults.

In addition, it should also be able as much as possible to be used for all animals as well as tissues and/or cells. For chromosomal analysis, we need viable cells that are able to divide, and if this is not possible, these methods cannot be used. On the other hand, genetic methods are reliable and do not need living cells, and it is easy to obtain DNA for these studies even in very ancient and nonviable tissues. These methods are therefore the most accepted ones The current study aimed to Determine the gender of a given DNA samples by designed vaulable specific-PCR tool. Methodology: Thirty eight ( ninteen from each male and female) human blood samples were collected using EDTA-Na2 tubes for direct DNA extraction after taken the agreement of the volunteers to give the blood sample. via expert. The blood sample mixed well by rotation of EDTA tube. two sets of species specific primer pairs targeting Homo sapiens (AMLE X and AMLE Y) genes. were designed and checked. PCR and sequencing were performed and sequences were analyzed and register in GenBank. Results: the results revealed that, the amplicon of AMLE X gene of Homo sapiens were 1164bp and AMLE Y were 744bp Conclusion: The current study conclude that, validity and accuracy of designed 12S rRNA species specific primer pairs for human and nonhuman animal blood typing as a forensic tool and there is no intraspecies cross amplification. © 2020, Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology.

Our data show that the succession choice for family firms in China has changed since 2011. Before 2011, most firms were inherited by their family members. After 2011, professional managers were considered to be candidates. During the succession process, there is serious gender discrimination. If the next generation is male, the results remain constant.

We aimed to systematically review theoretical and empirical investigations of factors influencing variation in response to and management of identity-related stress among black and white Americans. OvidPsychInfo and PubMed databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Criteria were participant age of ≥ 18 years, conducted in the US sampling black or white participants, and published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. The final sample included 167 articles. Theories suggesting social status inequities as the primary contributor to disparate strategies employed by black and white women and men to manage social identity-related stress were most frequently tested and supported. Studies disproportionally focused on how women and black persons cope as targets of prejudice and discrimination rather than on how management strategies of men or white persons are affected as perpetrators. Finally, there was theoretical support for an interactive effect of race and gender on stress management, but empirical evidence was lacking, particularly among black men, white women, and white men. The literature could be strengthened through the use of prospective cohorts and nationally representative samples, as well as study designs accounting for potential within-race and within-gender variation in the effects of social identity-related stressors on coping. With greater consistency in methodology, future empirical studies may yield additional information regarding group differences in stress management pertinent to clarifying mechanisms for the health consequences of exposure to social inequity among black and white women and men. © 2018, W.

Prior research suggests that salient inequality may be viewed as a threat to dominant-group members’ self and collective moral character. However, people possess multiple social identities and may be advantaged in one domain (e.g., White) while concurrently disadvantaged in another domain (e.g., sexual minority). The present research tests whether individuals may reduce the moral-image threat of being societally advantaged in one domain by highlighting discrimination they face in other domains.

Using a gender-balanced sample with equal proportions of black and minority ethnic and white undergraduate students (N = 240), we found that, expectedly, ethnic identity centrality intensified the effects of higher frequency of potentially harassing experiences on lower self-esteem and lower positive affect. Unexpectedly, however, gender identity centrality buffered the effects of higher frequency as well as more negative evaluation of potentially harassing experiences on lower self-esteem, indicating that gender identity centrality may be a protective resource, even though it is not specific to ethnic harassment. Exploratory analyses revealed that for black and minority ethnic respondents with high ethnic identity centrality and for white respondents with low ethnic identity centrality, there were associations between more negative evaluation of potentially harassing experiences and lower self-esteem and lower positive affect.

In the investigated scenario we aim to maximize the classifier's gender discrimination performance without providing access to more specific speaker identity information. Given these closely related objectives it can be expected that features extracted for gender classification will also carry some speaker-discriminative information. Our privacy enhancement approach consists of employing an adversarial feature extraction model, which aims to maximize gender classification accuracy (utility) while encouraging poor speaker identification results (privacy). The proposed model's loss function and budget scaling factor for controlling the balance between the levels of privacy and utility are analyzed.

To overcome these challenges, in Asia, a simplified model, designated as e-TropICS was previously developed. We sought to externally validate this model using data from a multi-centre critical care registry in India. Methods Seven ICUs from the Indian Registry of IntenSive care(IRIS) contributed data to this study. Patients > 18 years of age with an ICU length of stay > 6 hours were included. Data including age, gender, co-morbidity, diagnostic category, type of admission, vital signs, laboratory measurements and outcomes were collected for all admissions. e-TropICS was calculated as per original methods. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was used to express the model’s power to discriminate between survivors and non-survivors. For all tests of significance, a 2-sided P less than or equal to 0.05 was considered to be significant. AUROC values were considered poor when ≤ to 0.70, adequate between 0.71 to 0.80, good between 0.81 to 0.90, and excellent at 0.91 or higher. Calibration was assessed using Hosmer-Lemeshow C -statistic. Results We included data from 2062 consecutive patient episodes. The median age of the cohort was 60 and predominantly male (n = 1350, 65.47%). Mechanical Ventilation and vasopressors were administered at admission in 504 (24.44%) and 423 (20.51%) patients respectively. Overall, mortality at ICU discharge was 10.28% (n = 212). Discrimination (AUC) for the e-TropICS model was 0.83 (95% CI 0.812–0.839) with an HL C statistic p value of < 0.05. The best sensitivity and specificity (84% and 72% respectively) were achieved with the model at an optimal cut-off for probability of 0.29. Conclusion e-TropICS has utility in the care of critically unwell patients in the South Asia region with good discriminative capacity. Further refinement of calibration in larger datasets from India and across the South-East Asia region will help in improving model performance. © 2020 Vijayaraghavan et al.

Populations of artificial agents compete for promotion in their chosen professions, leading to emergent distributions that can be matched to real-life scenarios, and allowing the influence of socially or genetically acquired career preferences to be explored. The aim is that such models will enable better understanding of how imbalances emerge and evolve, facilitate the identification of specific signals that can indicate the presence or absence of discrimination, and provide a tool for determining how and when particular intervention strategies may be appropriate for rectifying any inequalities. Results generated from a representative series of abstract case studies involving innate or culturally-acquired gender-based ability differences, gender-based discrimination, and various forms of gender-specific career preferences, demonstrate the power of the approach. These simulations will hopefully inspire and facilitate better approaches for dealing with these issues in real life. © 2018, University of Surrey.

In this paper, we use model-based analysis and deep learning methods for gender classification from ear images. We use these methods to determine the differences between female and male ears. We confirm the identification performance and then the gender discrimination before analyzing which ear parts contribute most to performance. To this end, we compare the heatmaps of different genders with identification heatmaps. It appears from the heatmaps that ears encode females and males differently and we show how this can lead to successful gender discrimination and to increase insight into the process of identification of people by their ears. This could lead to gender identification in surveillance imagery, even when the face is concealed and provides a potential focus for future gender research. © 2020 IEEE.","Biometrics; Deep learning; Gender classification; Gender discrimination; Gender identification; Gender research; Heatmaps; Learning methods; Surveillance imagery; Use-model; Learning systems","gender classification; heatmaps; significant parts","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","8th International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics, IWBF 2020","160773","Porto","29 April 2020 through 30 April 2020","Computers","English","Int.

However, trans and gender diverse people have experienced significant marginalization and discrimination in health care settings. Health professionals are generally not adequately prepared by current curricula to provide appropriate healthcare to trans and gender diverse people. This strongly implies that health care students would benefit from curricula which facilitate learning about gender-affirming health care. Main body: Trans and gender diverse people have been pathologized by the medical profession, through classifications of mental illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Disease (ICD). Although this is changing in the new ICD-11, tension remains between depathologization discourses and access to gender-affirming health care. Trans and gender diverse people experience significant health disparities and an increased burden of disease, specifically in the areas of mental health, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, violence and victimisation. Many of these health disparities originate from discrimination and systemic biases that decrease access to care, as well as from health professional ignorance. This paper will outline gaps in health science curricula that have been described in different contexts, and specific educational interventions that have attempted to improve awareness, knowledge and skills related to gender-affirming health care. The education of primary care providers is critical, as in much of the world, specialist services for gender-affirming health care are not widely available. The ethics of the gatekeeping model, where service providers decide who can access care, will be discussed and contrasted with the informed-consent model that upholds autonomy by empowering patients to make their own health care decisions. Conclusion: There is an ethical imperative for health professionals to reduce health care disparities of trans and gender diverse people and practice within the health care values of social justice and cultural humility. As health science educators, we have an ethical duty to include gender-affirming health in health science curricula in order to prevent harm to the trans and gender diverse patients that our students will provide care for in the future. © 2020 The Author(s).","Curriculum; Delivery of Health Care; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Health Personnel; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services for Transgender Persons; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Male; Needs Assessment; Risk Assessment; Transgender Persons; United States; curriculum; education; ethics; female; health care delivery; health care disparity; health care personnel; health service; human; male; medical education; needs assessment; procedures; risk assessment; transgender; United States","Gender-affirming health care; Health disparities; Health science education; Pathologisation; Social justice; Trans and gender diverse; Transgender","","","","BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","","","English","BMC Med.

Machine learning algorithms trained on social media data may therefore perpetuate or amplify discriminatory attitudes against various demographic groups, causing unfair decision-making. One important application for machine learning is the automatic detection of cyberbullying. Biases in this context could take the form of bullying detectors that make false detections more frequently on messages by or about certain identity groups. In this paper, we present an approach for training bullying detectors from weak supervision while reducing the degree to which learned models reflect or amplify discriminatory biases in the data. Our goal is to decrease the sensitivity of models to language describing particular social groups. An ideal, fair language-based detector should treat language describing subpopulations of particular social groups equitably. Building on a previously proposed weakly supervised learning algorithm, we penalize the model when discrimination is observed. By penalizing unfairness, we encourage the learning algorithm to avoid unfair behavior in its predictions and achieve equitable treatment for protected subpopulations. We introduce two unfairness penalty terms: one aimed at removal fairness and another at substitutional fairness. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting models’ fairness on a synthetic benchmark and data from Twitter comparing against crowdsourced annotation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Computer crime; Decision making; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Automatic Detection; Cyber bullying; Demographic groups; Sexual orientations; Social media; Social media datum; Supervised machine learning; Synthetic benchmark; Learning algorithms","Co-trained ensemble; Cyberbullying detection; Embedding models; Fairness in machine learning; Social media; Weakly supervised machine learning","","","","Springer","8th International Conference on Computational Data and Social Networks, CSoNet 2019","235619","Ho Chi Minh City","18 November 2019 through 20 November 2019","","English","Lect.

Concealing a sexual minority identity can simultaneously generate the stress of hiding, protect against the stress of discrimination, and keep one apart from sexual minority communities and their norms and supports. Not surprisingly, existing studies of the association between sexual orientation concealment and mental health problems show contradictory associations-from positive to negative to null. This meta-analysis attempts to resolve these contradictions. Across 193 studies (n = 92,236) we find a small positive association between sexual orientation concealment and internalizing mental health problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, distress, problematic eating; ESr = 0.126; 95% CI [0.102, 0.151]) and a small negative association between concealment and substance use problems (ESr =-0.061; 95% CI [-0.096,-0.026]). The association between concealment and internalizing mental health problems was larger for those studies that assessed concealment as lack of open behavior, those conducted recently, and those with younger samples; it was smaller in exclusively bisexual samples. Year of data collection, study location, and sample gender, education, and racial/ethnic composition did not explain between-study heterogeneity. Results extend existing theories of stigma and sexual minority mental health, suggesting potentially distinct stress processes for internalizing problems versus substance use problems, life course fluctuations in the experience of concealment, distinct experiences of concealment for bisexual individuals, and measurement recommendations for future studies. Small overall effects, heavy reliance on cross-sectional designs, relatively few effects for substance use problems, and the necessarily coarse classification of effect moderators in this meta-analysis suggest future needed methodological advances to further understand the mental health of this still-increasingly visible population. © 2020 American Psychological Association.","Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Bisexuality; Comorbidity; Confidentiality; Cross-Sectional Studies; Defense Mechanisms; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Risk Factors; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior; Social Stigma; Substance-Related Disorders; adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; bisexuality; comorbidity; confidentiality; cross-sectional study; defense mechanism; drug dependence; female; human; male; mental disease; meta analysis; psychology; risk factor; sexual and gender minority; sexual behavior; social stigma","Bisexual; Depression and anxiety; Sexual orientation; Stigma concealment; Substance use problems","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (T32 MH020031)","American Psychological Association","","","","","","English","Psychol.

Data were from a sample of 3758 black or white adults in CARDIA, a community-based cohort recruited in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN, and Oakland, CA in 1985–6 (year 0). Racial and gender discrimination were assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination scale. CVH was evaluated using a 12-point composite outcome modified from the Life's Simple 7, with higher scores indicating better health. Multivariable linear regressions were used to evaluate the associations between different perceptions of discrimination and CVH scores two decades later by race and gender simultaneously. Reporting racial and gender discrimination in ≥2 settings were 48% of black women, 42% of black men, 10% of white women, and 5% of white men. Year 30 CVH scores (mean, SD) were 7.9(1.4), 8.1(1.6), 8.8(1.6), and 8.7(1.3), respectively. Compared with those of their race-gender groups reporting no discrimination, white women reporting only gender-based discrimination saw an adjusted score difference of +0.3 (95% CI: 0.0,0.6), whereas white men reporting only racial discrimination had on average a 0.4 (95% CI: 0.1,0.8) higher score, and scores among white men reporting both racial and gender discrimination were on average 0.6 (95% CI: 1.1,-0.1) lower than those of their group reporting no discrimination. Consistent with predictions of the IP model, the associations of reported racial and gender discrimination with future CVH were different for different racially-defined gender groups. More research is needed to understand why reported racial and gender discrimination might better predict deterioration in CVH for whites than blacks, and what additional factors associated with gender and race contribute variability to CVH among these groups. © 2019","adult; article; Black person; cardia; Caucasian; cohort analysis; controlled study; deterioration; female; human; human experiment; identity; Illinois; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; perception; prediction; racism; sex difference; sexism","Cardiovascular health; Discrimination; Gendered race; Health inequities; Identity pathology; Intersectionality; USA","","","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (5T32HL120823-03, HHSN268201800003I)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","SSM Popul.

Many cyber systems are being developed to recognize human speech type. These systems mainly comprise of a feature segment process which extracts and selects the features of human speeches. Feature extraction and feature selection are the most noteworthy phase of speech recognition involving numerous strategies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential effectiveness of spectral analysis and higher-order statistics performed over the speech segments of different genders. Spectral analysis is done via spectral descriptors consisting of varied parameters which are widely used in machine learning applications. The varied gender speeches are distinguished by means of parameters, i.e., higher order statistics, like spectral centroid, spectral entropy, spectral kurtosis, spectral slope and spectral flatness. The results obtained show successful discrimination of male and female speeches based on the peakiness of speech, voiced and unvoiced and higher and lower formants. © 2019 IEEE.","Feature extraction; Speech analysis; Speech processing; Speech recognition; Comparative analysis; Gender identification; Hot research topics; Machine learning applications; Spectral descriptors; Spectral flatness; Spectral Kurtosis; Varied parameters; Higher order statistics","Higher-order statistics; Spectral centroid; Spectral descriptor; Spectral entropy; Spectral flatness; Spectral kurtosis; Spectral slope","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","6th IEEE International Conference on Smart Instrumentation, Measurement and Application, ICSIMA 2019","159025","Kuala Lumpur","27 August 2019 through 29 August 2019","IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society Malaysia Chapter","English","IEEE Int.

Informed by an intersectionality framework that facilitates an understanding of intragroup dynamics, this exploratory qualitative study used in-depth interviews to ask 20 people with MHCs and family members of people with MHCs who also identified as of color and/or LGB about their experiences (a) with mental illness discrimination and supports within their identity communities and (b) in peer- and family-run programs. Participants of color reported that their racial ethnic communities commonly deny that MHCs exist and shame people with MHCs, and LGB participants said that LGB communities often exclude and stereotype them. Interactions with others with MHCs and affirmation of lesbian and gay identities serve as recovery supports within identity communities. Peer- and family-run programs provide a sense of humanization and education, respectively but are sites of heterosexism and may not address the needs of people of color; identity-specific programs are therefore desired. We describe variations in experiences related to race, ethnicity, and sexuality intersections; no differences in descriptions of mental illness discrimination in the focal identity communities emerged between people with MHCs versus family members. Implications include that efforts are needed to address discrimination in identity communities and peer- and family-run programs, and service providers need to recognize that identity intersections affect experiences with discrimination and supports.

The experiments have been performed over one of the largest corpora collected for such a task in the literature (62 patients diagnosed with depression and 54 healthy control subjects), especially when it comes to data where the depressed speakers have been diagnosed as such by professional psychiatrists. The results show that the discrimination can be performed with an accuracy of over 75% and the error analysis shows that the chances of correct classification do not change according to gender, depression-related pathology diagnosed by the psychiatrists or length of the pharmacological treatment (if any). Furthermore, for every depressed subject, the corpus includes a control subject that matches age, education level and gender. This ensures that the approach actually discriminates between depressed and non depressed speakers and does not simply capture differences resulting from other factors. © 2018 IEEE.","","Computational Paralinguistics; Depression; Feature Selection; Nonverbal Communication; Social Signal Processing","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (769872); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/M025055/1, EP/N035305/1)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2018","139797","Calgary","15 April 2018 through 20 April 2018","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Signal Processing Society","English","ICASSP IEEE Int Conf Acoust Speech Signal Process Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Although researchers and journalists have found many ways that advertisers can target—or exclude—particular groups of users seeing their ads, comparatively little attention has been paid to the implications of the platform’s ad delivery process, comprised of the platform’s choices about which users see which ads. It has been hypothesized that this process can “skew” ad delivery in ways that the advertisers do not intend, making some users less likely than others to see particular ads based on their demographic characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate that such skewed delivery occurs on Facebook, due to market and financial optimization effects as well as the platform’s own predictions about the “relevance” of ads to different groups of users. We find that both the advertiser’s budget and the content of the ad each significantly contribute to the skew of Facebook’s ad delivery. Critically, we observe significant skew in delivery along gender and racial lines for “real” ads for employment and housing opportunities despite neutral targeting parameters. Our results demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms that can lead to potentially discriminatory ad delivery, even when advertisers set their targeting parameters to be highly inclusive. This underscores the need for policymakers and platforms to carefully consider the role of the ad delivery optimization run by ad platforms themselves—and not just the targeting choices of advertisers—in preventing discrimination in digital advertising.1 © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Nevertheless, there is still no recurrence prediction factor concisely established and reproduced in the literature for NFPA management. The present study evaluates the prognostic value of MRI Radiomics features combined with machine learning models to assess recurrence after the first surgery in patients with clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA). We carried out a retrospective study on 27 patients with NFPA, 10 patients having experienced tumor recurrence after the first surgery and 17 who did not. Preoperative 3D T1 contrast-enhanced MR images of patients were used to extract up to 255 Radiomics features from two and three-dimensional segmented regions. Additionally, gender, age at first surgery, and the presence of remnant tumor tissue were investigated to find the correlation with NFPA recurrence. Conventional statistics tests were used to evaluate whether the outcome patient groups (stable and recurrent) were different considering each feature individually. Additionally, five well-known machine-learning algorithms were used in combination with Radiomic features to classify recurrent and stable lesions. We found statistical evidence (p < 0.02) for 6 two-dimensional and 13 three-dimensional radiomic features. We achieved accuracies of up to 96.3% for 3D-feature based models and up to 92.6% accuracies for 2D-feature based models. 3D-feature based models achieved better performances using considerably fewer features when compared to 2D-feature based models. We concluded that Radiomics have the potential of NFPA recurrence prediction after the first surgery. Three-dimensional Radiomics have superior discrimination power to predict NFPA recurrence than two-dimensional radiomic features. Finally, the combination of Radiomics with machine-learning algorithms can offer computational models capable of non-invasive, unbiased, and quick assessment that might improve the prediction of NFPA recurrence. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithms; Humans; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pituitary Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Forecasting; Image enhancement; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Surgery; Tumors; Computational model; Contrast-enhanced MR; Feature-based model; Machine learning models; Recurrence predictions; Segmented regions; Statistical evidence; Tumor recurrences; adult; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical article; clinical outcome; computer model; controlled study; feature extraction; female; follow up; human; image processing; image segmentation; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; macroadenoma; male; middle aged; multilayer perceptron; nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prognosis; radiomics; random forest; retrospective study; support vector machine; surgical approach; three-dimensional imaging; tumor recurrence; two-dimensional imaging; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; hypophysis tumor; machine learning; Learning algorithms","Machine learning; MRI; Pituitary adenoma; Radiomics; Tumor recurrence","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (001)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Comput.

Trans/GNC individuals are faced with a dual reality. On one hand, they are part of a highly organized and activated group whose rights depend on political engagement; on the other hand, individuals often face barriers to political participation including a lack of proper identification and low socioeconomic status. In this paper, we explore the effects of these competing forces on trans/GNC voter registration. We use the theory of oppositional consciousness to hypothesize that being part of a political and highly mobilized population helps trans/GNC individuals overcome barriers to participation. Using data on over 5000 self-identified trans/GNC individuals from the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey we show that, though individuals are less likely to participate if they lack gender-conforming identification, on the whole trans/GNC individuals in this survey register at rates that are consistent with or higher than the general population. The evidence points to the importance of the trans political movement in activating and developing oppositional consciousness in its members. We explore the implications of these findings and what they mean for future research. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Gender non-conforming; Political participation; Transgender; Voter registration","","","","Springer","","","","","","English","Polit.

In the past, homosexuality was unacceptable in mainstream society, and same-sex relationships underwent discrimination (Elipe et al., 2018). Perhaps because of this social context and the fact that sexual assault signifies conquest and power (Brownmiller, 1975), which is inconsistent with the image of homosexual men, research on the perpetration of sexual assault by homosexuals is limited. Homosexual men’s perpetration of sexual assault is not the same as male sexual assault on men. The latter perpetrators are not necessarily homosexuals, whereas a few of the former perpetrators may be able to assault women. Some studies have explored male sexual assault on men (Abdullah-Khan, 2008), such as male-on-male sexual assault in prisons; however, research is yet to be conducted on sexual assault perpetrated by homosexual men. Hirschi (1969) indicated that committing crimes is part of human nature. Under this point of view, it is understandable that gay men commit sexual assault. Studies have failed to investigate this issue; however, we believed this issue is worthy of research attention. Because the majority of sexual assaults are currently still performed by men (Police Administration of the Ministry of the Interior, 2017), this study explored sexual assaults perpetrated by homosexual men. Scholars such as Marshall and Barbaree (1990), Hall and Hirschman (1991), Ward and Beech (2006), and Seto (2019) have presented the integrated theory of sexual assault, which means that regardless of the subject (male or female) or object (child, adult, male, or female), sexual assault is within the explanatory scope of their theory. In other words, irrespective of the sex offender’s sexual orientation, causes behind the offence can be explained by high-level constructs. Accordingly, this study proposed the following three risk factors that partly explain reasons for sexual assault by homosexual men: Experiences of sexual abuse, acceptance of rape myths, and gender biases. Experiences of sexual abuse constitute the social learning factor (undergoing sexual assault and then following the example), whereas rape myths and gender biases are cognitive factors. All the three factors are emphasized by the integrated theory of sexual assault. These factors are more instructive and cognitive in nature and therefore more changeable (compared with factors that are biological in nature). Hence, we chose them as the subject of our investigation to facilitate subsequent suggestions on sexual assault prevention. We assumed the following: (a) The experiences of sexual abuse, degree of rape myth acceptance, and gender biases affect homosexual men’s perpetration of sexual assault. (b) The age at which sexual abuse was first encountered, degree of rape myth acceptance, and gender biases affect the frequency of sexual assault perpetration by homosexual men. (c) According to Ellis (1991) and Seto (2019), targets chosen by sexual assault offenders are determined by their sexual preferences. On the basis of sexual preferences, we hypothesized that men are mostly the target of homosexual men’s sexual assault. (d) If homosexual men’s targets are mostly men, we hypothesized that the influence of male rape myths on homosexual men’s sexual assault is stronger than that of female rape myths. This is because male rape myths comprise a set of prejudices, distorted thinking, or stereotypes against male rape. We followed the research design of Bohner et al. (2005). Two types of questionnaire were developed to collect data online. In Questionnaire B, we placed independent variables (experiences of sexual abuse, two types of rape myths, and gender biases) before dependent variables (sexual assault and frequency of occurrence). The opposite was true for Questionnaire A. Because questions arranged first can trigger participants’ thinking and enhance their cognitive accessibility (heightened temporary accessibility), the stimulation (priming) may affect their answers to the following questions. Therefore, we expected that the association between the independent and dependent variables in the Questionnaire B sample would be higher than that in the Questionnaire A sample, in turn indirectly evidencing the causal relationship between the variables. Additionally, the impact of the order of questions and whether the results were the same in both the samples were also examined. Because Questionnaire A first asked participants about their engagement in sexual assault and frequency, the sensitive nature of the topic might have led to defensiveness; therefore, we predicted that the recognition of rape myth acceptance and gender biases in Questionnaire A would be lower than that in Questionnaire B. We recruited participants who identified as homosexual men and had experiences of undergoing sexual abuse or sexually assaulting others. A total of 414 valid responses were obtained (194 from Questionnaire A and 220 from Questionnaire B). Participants’ background information was as follows: (a) The participants’ average age was 28.28 years, the standard deviation was 6.57 years, the youngest participant was aged 16 years, and the oldest participant was aged 45 years; (b) Educational level: A majority of the participants were at the college level (250, 60.4%), followed by the graduate school level (109, 26.3%); (c) Primary caregiver: Parents (307, 74.2%) and grandparents (39, 9.4%); (d) Experience of committing sexual assault: Yes (47.3%) and no (52.7%); and (e) Experience of being sexually assaulted: Yes (89.4%) and no (10.6%). The t test and chi-square test were used to determine the impact of the three types of risk factors on homosexual men’s sexual assault. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable, and the amount of variance was explained. Additionally, all the independent variables were placed in the model to examine the effect of the exclusion of overlapping. Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to verify the model on homosexual men’s engagement with sexual assault and its frequency. The results of the study suggested that experiences of sexual abuse, acceptance of rape myths, and gender biases all exert a significant impact and explanatory power on homosexual men’s perpetration of sexual assault. A comparison of the samples of Questionnaires A and B revealed that Questionnaire B had a higher explanatory power for sexual assault perpetrated by homosexual men compared with Questionnaire A (27.1%–36.2% vs. 22.6%–30.3%). This result suggests that regardless of the order of questionnaire items, this study’s hypotheses were supported. Additionally, the result suggested that the independent variables arranged in front of the dependent variables presented a more effective design for confirming our hypotheses compared with vice versa. The average scores of gender biases and rape myths in Questionnaire A were lower than those in Questionnaire B, indicating that sensitive topics presented earlier made participants more cautious or defensive while answering subsequent questions. Furthermore, experiences of sexual abuse, rape myth acceptance, and gender biases influenced not only sexual assault by homosexual men but also their persistence in perpetrating the same. This study confirmed that the majority of homosexual men’s sexual assault targets were men, and regarding myths, male rape myths had more influence on their sexual assaults than did female rape myths. The results of this study revealed that both gender biases and the degree of recognition of rape myths influence sexual assault behavior among homosexual men. Therefore, the sexual aggression behavior signifying the implications of gender bias and power display discussed in past theories can also be observed in homosexual men. The various prevention and publicity measures against sexual assault in our society today are relatively designed from the perspective of viewing women as victims, and myths involving male rape are ignored. However, the impact of male rape myths on sexual assaults by homosexual men is even greater than that exerted by female rape myths, highlighting that male rape myths must be urgently understood and publicized to be eliminated. This may reduce the stigma male victims undergo (McMullen, 1990; Scarce, 1997), which in turn will increase their willingness to report and receive treatment. The perpetrators will have the fear that the victim will come forward, which might help reduce the rate of sexual assault. From a deeper perspective, providing societal acceptance of homosexuality and eliminating myths of male rape will not only reduce the rate of sexual assault, which is extremely underestimated (Coxell et al., 2000), but also aid the addressal of homosexual men’s sexual assault issues. This study recruited homosexual men who had experiences of sexual abuse or sexual assault as participants. Thus, the condition of sexual assault and victimization was widespread. We suggest that future research should include large and representative samples of homosexual men with no restrictions on sexual assault or experiences of being sexually assaulted. This will not only help estimate the prevalence of sexual assault and being sexually assaulted among homosexual men in Taiwan but also further confirm the external validity of the research results. © 2020, National Taiwan Normal University.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to full-band specific phase space trajectory matrix (PSTM) extracted from short emotional EEG segment of 6 s, then the first principal component is used to measure the level of local neuronal complexity. As well, Phase Locking Value (PLV) between right and left hemispheres is estimated for in order to observe the superiority of local neuronal complexity estimation to regional neuro-cortical connectivity measurements in clustering nine discrete emotions (fear, anger, happiness, sadness, amusement, surprise, excitement, calmness, disgust) by using Long-Short-Term-Memory Networks as deep learning applications. In tests, two groups (healthy females and males aged between 22 and 33 years old) are classified with the accuracy levels of \text{68.52}{\%} and \text{79.36}{\%} through the proposed emotional complexity markers and and connectivity levels in terms of PLV in amusement. The groups are found to be statistically different (p\ll 0.5) in amusement with respect to both metrics, even if gender difference does not lead to different neuro-cortical functions in any of the other discrete emotional states. The high deep learning classification accuracy of \text{98.00}{\%} is commonly obtained for discrimination of positive emotions from negative emotions through the proposed new complexity markers. Besides, considerable useful classification performance is obtained in discriminating mixed emotions from each other through full-band connectivity features. The results reveal that emotion formation is mostly influenced by individual experiences rather than gender. In detail, local neuronal complexity is mostly sensitive to the affective valance rating, while regional neuro-cortical connectivity levels are mostly sensitive to the affective arousal ratings. © 2013 IEEE.","Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Deep Learning; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Motion Pictures; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult; Complex networks; Neurons; Phase space methods; Space flight; Text processing; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Complexity estimation; Cortical functions; First principal components; Gender differences; Phase locking value; Phase space trajectory; adult; arousal; article; biophysics; brain; controlled study; deep learning; emotion; female; human; human experiment; male; neuroscience; sex difference; videorecording; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; brain; classification; electroencephalography; emotion; movie; physiology; procedures; signal processing; young adult; Deep learning","affective neuroscience; Brain biophysics; deep learning; emotion recognition","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","English","IEEE J.

People with nonbinary gender identities do not exclusively identify as men or women. Feminist legal reformers have long argued that discrimination on the basis of gender nonconformity — in other words, discrimination against men perceived as feminine or women perceived as masculine — is a harmful type of sex discrimination that the law should redress. But the idea of nonbinary gender as an identity itself only appears at the margins of U.S. legal scholarship. Many of the cases recognizing transgender rights involve plaintiffs who identify as men or women, rather than plaintiffs who seek to reject, permute, or transcend those categories. The increased visibility of a nonbinary minority creates challenges for other rights movements, while also opening new avenues for feminist and LGBT advocacy. This Article asks what the law would look like if it took nonbinary gender seriously. It assesses the legal interests in binary gender regulation in areas including law enforcement, employment, education, housing, and health care, and concludes these interests are not reasons to reject nonbinary gender rights. It argues that the law can recognize nonbinary gender identities, or eliminate unnecessary legal sex classifications, using familiar civil rights concepts. © 2019, Harvard Law Review Association.

However, when judging the fairness of a newly designed decision making system, these studies have overlooked an important influence on people's perceptions of fairness, which is how the new algorithm changes the status quo, i.e., decisions of the existing decision making system. Motivated by extensive literature in behavioral economics and behavioral psychology (prospect theory), we propose a notion of fair updates that we refer to as loss-averse updates. Loss-averse updates constrain the updates to yield improved (more beneficial) outcomes to subjects compared to the status quo. We propose tractable proxy measures that would allow this notion to be incorporated in the training of a variety of linear and non-linear classifiers. We show how our proxy measures can be combined with existing measures for training nondiscriminatory classifiers. Our evaluation using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed proxy measures are effective for their desired tasks. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Decision making; Economics; Machine learning; Philosophical aspects; Algorithmic Fairness; Behavioral economics; Behavioral psychologies; Decision-making systems; Fair Updates; Nonlinear classifiers; Real-world datasets; Sensitive features; Behavioral research","Algorithmic Fairness; Fair Updates; Fairness in Machine Learning; Loss-averse Fairness","","","European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (789373); European Research Council, ERC","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","2nd AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, AIES 2019","149526","Honolulu","27 January 2019 through 28 January 2019","BERI; DeepMind and Society; et al.; Google; IBM Research; NSF","English","AIES - Proc.

Because patients with white matter lesions do not have any symptoms, MRI often detects the lesions for the first time. Generally, head MRI for the diagnosis and grading of cerebral white matter lesions is performed as an option during medical checkups in Japan. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for the prediction of white matter lesions using data from routine medical evaluations that do not include a head MRI. Linear discriminant analysis, logistic discrimination, Naive Bayes classifier, support vector machine, and random forest were investigated and evaluated by ten-fold cross-validation, using clinical data for 1,904 examinees (988 males and 916 females) from medical checkups that did include the head MRI. The logistic regression model was selected based on a comparison of accuracy and interpretability. The model variables consisted of age, gender, plaque score (PS), LDL, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and administration of antihypertensive medication (odds ratios: 2.99, 1.57, 1.18, 1.06, 1.12, and 1.52, respectively) and showed Areas Under the ROC Curve (AUC) 0.805, the model displayed sensitivity of 72.0%, and specificity 75.1% when the most appropriate cutoff value was used, 0.579 as given by the Youden Index.

However, sexual minority youth (SMY) are often less willing to participate in research studies where parental consent is required due to potential victimization and discrimination. This is a major concern given that more research is needed to understand the health needs of this population, especially in terms of suicide, substance use, and HIV prevention. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy classifies SMY as a high-risk group, emphasizing the need to explore suicide risks (along with other health outcomes) among this group. However, this high-risk classification also increases the safeguards necessary to conduct research with this population. Many researchers have argued for waivers of parental consent, but such waivers present with several ethical implications. This article discusses ethical principles, risks, benefits, safeguards, and potential alternative approaches to waivers of parental consent for SMY. We conclude by emphasizing the need for policy changes to allow parental consent waivers for research targeting SMY. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescent; Child; Ethics Committees, Research; Female; Humans; Male; Parental Consent; Research; Risk Assessment; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Suicide; adolescent; child; ethics; female; human; male; organization and management; parental consent; professional standard; psychology; research; risk assessment; sexual and gender minority; suicide","IRB; parental consent; Sexual minority; waiver","","","","Taylor and Francis Inc.","","","","","","English","Account.

The majority of thus far proposed fairness-aware machine learning approaches focus solely on the pre-, in-or post-processing steps of the machine learning process, that is, input data, learning algorithms or derived models, respectively. However, the fairness problem cannot be isolated to a single step of the ML process. Rather, discrimination is often a result of complex interactions between big data and algorithms, and therefore, a more holistic approach is required.The proposed FAE (Fairness-Aware Ensemble) framework combines fairness-related interventions at both pre-and post-processing steps of the data analysis process. In the pre-processing step, we tackle the problems of under-representation of the protected group (group imbalance) and of class-imbalance by generating balanced training samples. In the post-processing step, we tackle the problem of class overlapping by shifting the decision boundary in the direction of fairness. © 2019 IEEE.","Big data; Decision making; Machine learning; Automated decision making; Class imbalance; class overlap; Ensemble learning; group imbalance; Machine learning approaches; Pre-processing step; Sexual orientations; Learning algorithms","class imbalance; class overlap; ensemble learning; fairness-aware classification; group imbalance","","","European Unions Horizon 2020; Marie Skodowska-Curie; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (860630)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2019","157991","Los Angeles","9 December 2019 through 12 December 2019","Ankura; Baidu; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; Very","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

This study developed a nomogram model to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with LCNEC. Methods LCNEC patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004–2014. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine demographic and clinicopathological features associated with OS. A nomogram model was generated to predict OS and its performance was assessed by Harrell’s concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, and subgroup analysis by risk scores. Results Of 3048 eligible patients with LCNEC, 2138 were randomly grouped into the training set and 910 into the validation set. Age at diagnosis, gender, tumor stage, N stage, tumor size, and surgery of primary site were independent prognostic factors of OS. C-index values of the nomogram were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.74–0.76) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.74–0.77) in the training and validation sets, respectively. In both cohorts, the calibration plots showed good concordance between the predicted and observed OS at 3 and 5 years. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significant differences in OS in patients stratified by nomogram-based risk score, and patients with a higher-than-median risk score had poorer OS. Conclusion This is the first nomogram developed and validated in a large population-based cohort for predicting OS in patients with LCNEC, and it shows favorable discrimination and calibration abilities. Use of this proposed nomogram has the potential to improve prediction of survival risk, and lead to individualized clinical decisions for LCNEC. © 2019 He et al.

We examined whether progressive corporate LGBT-related policies may be an extension of policies and practices designed to foster diversity and create equality for existing legally protected classes (women, ethnic minorities, veterans, and those with disabilities). We also examined whether leadership level diversity (percentage of women and ethnic minorities on company boards of directors) predicted nondiscrimination policies for LGBT employees. Hypotheses: We predicted companies that have been recognized and awarded for protected class diversity policies and that have a greater percentage of women and racial/ethnic minorities on their boards of directors would have more progressive LGBT-related corporate policies. Method: Using a sample of Fortune 500 companies, we examined protected-class diversity awards and percentage of women and racial/ethnic minorities on boards of directors as predictors of LGBT-related policies. At the company-level, we controlled for the average age of board, company size, and company revenue. At the level of company headquarter location, we controlled for political climate, Christian religiosity, and LGBT employment nondiscrimination laws. We also controlled for U.S. region and industry sector. Results: Multilevel modeling results indicated that protected-class diversity awards and the percentage of women on company boards of directors significantly and independently predicted progressive LGBT policy scores, whereas the percentage of racial/ethnic minorities on boards of directors had less consistent results. Conclusion: Companies that address issues of diversity and equality in the workplace have been likely to include the LGBT community among their groups of concern, even in the absence of legal pressures to do so. © 2020 American Psychological Association.","Adult; Civil Rights; Female; Gender Equity; Human Rights; Humans; Leadership; Male; Multilevel Analysis; Organizational Policy; Public Nondiscrimination Policies; Sexual and Gender Minorities; United States; Workplace; adult; civil rights; classification; female; human; human rights; leadership; male; multilevel analysis; organizational policy; sexual and gender minority; United States; workplace","Corporations; Discrimination; Diversity; Gender; LGBT","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Law Hum.

Method: Longitudinal self-report data over 7 waves of data collection from the Family and Community Health Study were utilized. The sample included 368 African Americans with usable gene expression data to compute accelerated aging, as well as complete data on all self-report variables including racial discrimination (Schedule of Racist Events) and depression (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version 4). Blood was collected by antecubital blood draws from participants at age 29. The proposed model was tested by path analysis. Results: Findings revealed that high discrimination at ages 10-15 was associated with depression at ages 20-29 (β = .19, p = .001), controlling for depression at ages 10-15, which, in turn, was related to accelerated cellular-level aging (β = .11, p = .048) after controlling for gender, alcohol consumption, and cigarette use. The indirect effect of racial discrimination on aging through depression at ages 20-29 was significant (β = .021, 95% confidence interval [.001, .057]), accounting for 32.3% of the total variance. Conclusion: These findings support research conceptualizations that early life stress due to racial discrimination lead to sustained negative affective states continuing into young adulthood that confer risk for accelerated aging and possibly premature disease and mortality in African Americans. These findings advance knowledge of potential underlying mechanisms that influence racial health disparities. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Aging; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Racism; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; African American; aging; child; female; human; male; mental stress; psychology; racism; young adult","African Americans; Aging; Discrimination; Health; Racism","","","National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (R01DA021898); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (R01HL118045); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD080749)","American Psychological Association","","","","","","English","Health Psychol.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Observers classify the gender of a walker at significantly above chance levels from a point-light distribution of joint trajectories. However, performance drops to chance level or below for vertically inverted stimuli, a phenomenon known as the inversion effect. This lack of robustness may reflect either a generic learning mechanism that has been exposed to insufficient instances of inverted stimuli or the activation of specialized mechanisms that are pre-tuned to upright stimuli. To address this issue, the authors compare the psychophysical performance of humans with the computational performance of neuromimetic machine-learning models in the classification of gender from gait by using the same biological motion stimulus set. Experimental results demonstrate significant similarities, which include those in the predominance of kinematic motion cues over structural cues in classification accuracy. Second, learning is expressed in the presence of the inversion effect in the models as in humans, suggesting that humans may use generic learning systems in the perception of biological motion in this task. Finally, modifications are applied to the model based on human perception, which mitigates the inversion effect and improves performance accuracy. The study proposes a paradigm for the investigation of human gender perception from gait and makes use of perceptual characteristics to develop a robust artificial gait classifier for potential applications such as clinical movement analysis. c Society for Imaging Science and Technology 2020","Classification accuracy; Comparative studies; Computational performance; Gender classification; Joint trajectories; Light distribution; Machine learning models; Science and Technology; Learning systems","","","","Medical Research Council, MRC","Society for Imaging Science and Technology","2020 Human Vision and Electronic Imaging Conference, HVEI 2020","163996","Burlingame","26 January 2020 through 30 January 2020","Center for Visual and Cognitive Neuroscience (NDSU); Dolby Vision; Qualcomm","English","IS T Intl.

However, its predictive ability for mortality in population-based samples remains understudied. We analysed the capability of cf-DNA to predict all-cause mortality and assessed whether it adds predictive value on top of the other risk factors in the Health 2000 survey (n = 1,257, 46–76 years of age, 15-years-follow-up, 18% deceased). When analysed in a multivariate model with the other factors that independently predicted mortality in the sample (age, gender, self-rated health, smoking and plasma levels of glucose and adiponectin), increases in cf-DNA levels were associated with increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for 0.1 µg increase in cf-DNA: 1.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.008–1.026, p = 0.0003). Inclusion of cf-DNA in the model improved the model fit and discrimination. Stratifying the analysis by cardiovascular disease (CVD) status indicated that cf-DNA predicted mortality equally well in individuals with (HR 1.018, 95% CI 1.008–1.026, p = 0.002) and without (HR 1.018, 95% CI 1.001–1.035, p = 0.033) CVD. In conclusion, our study indicates that cf-DNA level predicts mortality in middle-aged and older individuals, also among those with established CVD, and adds significant value to mortality prediction. Our results thus underscore the role of cf-DNA as a viable marker of health. © 2020, The Author(s).","Age Factors; Aged; Biomarkers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; DNA; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; biological marker; DNA; age; aged; blood; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; female; health survey; human; male; middle aged; mortality; predictive value; risk factor","","","DNA, 9007-49-2; Biomarkers, ; DNA, ","Diabetes Research Foundation of Finnish Diabetes Association; ETK; Finnish Centre for Pensions; KEVA; Local Government Pensions Institution; Loo & Hans Osterman Foundation; National Institute for Health and Welfare; Social Insurance Institution of Finland; Tampere University Hospital Supporting Foundation; Yrjö Jahnssonin Säätiö, (20197181); Horizon Pharmaceuticals; Kela; Suomen Akatemia, (322098, X51001); Karolinska Institutet, KI; Signe ja Ane Gyllenbergin Säätiö; Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2018-02077); Emil Aaltosen Säätiö; Sydäntutkimussäätiö; Tampereen Tuberkuloosisäätiö; Horizon 2020, (755320, 848146 TO-AITION); Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos, THL","Nature Research","","","","","","English","Sci.

Although research on radicalization is accumulating, a quantitative review of risk factors for youth radicalization is lacking. Therefore, a series of meta-analyses were conducted on k = 30 studies (247 effect sizes) to examine risk factors for radicalization in youth, yielding significant effects for 15 out of 17 risk domains, ranging in magnitude from r = 0.080 to r = 0.482. Medium positive effects were found for activism, perceived in-group superiority and perceived distance to other people, while small effects were found for gender, personality, delinquency and aggression, lower educational level, negative peers, in-group identification, perceived discrimination, perceived group threat, perceived procedural injustice, perceived illegitimacy of authorities, and other, whereas the effect for poverty was very small. Moderator analyses showed that the risks of negative parenting and societal disconnection were smaller for right-wing radicalization than for religious or unspecified radicalization. The risks of personality and perceived group threat were greater for willingness to carry out extremist acts and extremist behavior than for attitude towards radicalization. Further, when the percentage of ethnic minorities in the sample increased, the risks of personality, negative parenting, and societal disconnection for radicalization were larger. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","aggression; child parent relation; controlled study; delinquency; effect size; ethnic group; female; gender; human; illegitimacy; juvenile; male; meta analysis; personality; poverty; review; risk factor; wing","Extremism; Meta-analysis; Protective factors; Radicalization; Risk factors; Youth","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Aggression Violent Behav.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

To this end, the Supreme Court is currently considering whether Title VII already prohibits those forms of discrimination, and legislators have advanced the Equality Act, a new bill that would explicitly protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees. These debates, however, typically overlook a critical question: Does Congress actually have the authority to hold state governments accountable for discriminating against LGBT workers? This Note argues that Congress does. While Congress exercises its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment under the constraints of the Court’s “congruence and proportionality” standard, none of the limitations set by the Court foreclose the Equality Act’s provisions imposing liability on state employers. If the Court takes congruence and proportionality seriously, those provisions should stand. This Note thus challenges the conventional wisdom that LGBT individuals are beyond Congress’s power to protect merely because the Court does not for-mally review anti-LGBT discrimination under heightened scrutiny. It seeks to account for the Court’s clear concern with state action rooted in animus, which indicates that classifications targeting LGBT individuals are subject to careful judicial review. Moreover, it recasts the Court’s precedents on congressional enforce-ment, emphasizing that the legislative record and statutory scope, rather than the applicable standard of review, determine the validity of the statute in question. Under these clarified standards, the Equality Act emerges as appropriate enforce-ment legislation. © 2020, New York University Law Review.

A number of recent studies have begun to address the question of whether and under what circumstances men can also be the targets of gender discrimination. However, the results of these studies have so far been mixed. Therefore, the question of whether men, like women, also suffer discrimination when in gender incongruent roles and domains remains unclear. The goal of the present paper is to integrate and critically examine the burgeoning literature on gender discrimination against men in order to assess whether the symmetrical predictions of congruity models are supported. Through this close analysis and integration of the literature, I aim to identify remaining gaps in the research on gender discrimination. In particular, I propose that researchers of gender discrimination would benefit from expanding their scope beyond that of paid work. © 2019 Manzi.","","Gender discrimination; Gender stereotypes; Lack of fit; Male targets; Role congruity theory","","","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","English","Front.

This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to NONFH, but patients with alcohol- and steroid-related NONFH are not at all taken into account in this study. A training cohort of 790 patients (n = 434, NONFH; n = 356, femoral neck fractures [non-NONFH]) diagnosed in our hospital from January 2011 to December 2016 was used for model development. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression model was used for date dimension reduction and optimal predictor selection. A predictive model was developed from univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Performance characterisation of the resulting nomogram included calibration, discriminatory ability, and clinical usefulness. After internal validation, the nomogram was further evaluated in a separate cohort of 300 consecutive patients included between January 2017 and December 2018. The simple prediction nomogram included five predictors from univariate and multivariate analyses, including gender, total cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, white blood cell count, and platelet count. Internal validation showed that the model had good discrimination [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.80] and calibration. Good discrimination (AUC = 0.81) and calibration were preserved in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis showed that the predictive nomogram was clinically useful. The simple diagnostic nomogram, which combines demographic data and laboratory blood test results, was able to quantify the probability of NONFH in cases of early screening and diagnosis. © 2020, The Author(s).","Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Platelets; Cholesterol; Cohort Studies; Female; Femur Head; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nomograms; Osteonecrosis; Probability; ROC Curve; Triglycerides; cholesterol; triacylglycerol; Asian continental ancestry group; bone necrosis; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; female; femoral head; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; nomogram; pathology; probability; receiver operating characteristic; statistical model; thrombocyte","","","cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, ; Triglycerides, ","Key Research Plan of Jiangxi Province, (20171ACG70006); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC;NNSF;NNSFC, (81601912, 81660365, 81860404, 81860405)","Nature Research","","","","","","English","Sci.

We use machine learning text classifiers, keyword frequencies, and qualitative approaches first to distinguish these two subreddits, and second to interpret the differences ideologically rather than topically. We further integrate platform metadata (referred to as ‘platform signals’) to distinguish the subreddits. These signals help us understand how similar terms can be used to arrive at different interpretations of gender and discrimination. Where /r/MensLib tends to see masculinity as an adjective and women as peers, /r/MensRights views being a man as an essential quality, men as the target of discrimination, and women as sources of personalized grievances.

How people treat others is known to depend on a multitude of factors (e.g., others' gender, ethnicity, appearance) even when these should be irrelevant. However, despite substantial progress, much remains unknown regarding (i) the set of mechanisms shaping people's behavior toward members of different social groups and (ii) the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the structure of existing societal disparities. Here, we show in a set of experiments the important interplay between social perception and social valuation processes in explaining how people treat members of different social groups. Building on the idea that stereotypes can be organized onto basic, underlying dimensions, we first found using laboratory economic games that quantitative variation in stereotypes about different groups' warmth and competence translated meaningfully into resource allocation behavior toward those groups. Computational modeling further revealed that these effects operated via the interaction of social perception and social valuation processes, with warmth and competence exerting diverging effects on participants' preferences for equitable distributions of resources. This framework successfully predicted behavior toward members of a diverse set of social groups across samples and successfully generalized to predict societal disparities documented in labor and education settings with substantial precision and accuracy. Together, these results highlight a common set of mechanisms linking social group information to social treatment and show how preexisting, societally shared assumptions about different social groups can produce and reinforce societal disparities. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

The current analyses were restricted to the 1,388 participants who smoked at least once a week for 2 months in their lifetime. Item response theory (IRT) was used to investigate the severity and discrimination properties of 8 selected criteria. Additionally, differential criteria functioning (DCF) with sociodemographic characteristics (income, gender, age, employment status, marital status, and education) was investigated. All analyses were performed in Mplus software taking into account complex survey design features. IRT results indicated that the criterion Given Up had the lowest probability of endorsement (highest severity). The criterion Larger/Longer had the highest probability of endorsement (lowest severity), but the highest value of discrimination. Physical Withdrawal had the lowest discrimination property. No DCF was found both at criterion- and disorder-level, which would tear measurement bias.

In other words, replication efforts should seek not just to support or question the original findings, but also to replace them with revised, stronger theories with greater explanatory power. Achieving this will typically require adding new measures, conditions, and subject populations to research designs, in order to carry out conceptual tests of multiple theories in addition to directly replicating the original findings. To illustrate the value of the creative destruction approach for theory pruning in organizational scholarship, we describe recent replication initiatives re-examining culture and work morality, working parents’ reasoning about day care options, and gender discrimination in hiring decisions. Significance statement: It is becoming increasingly clear that many, if not most, published research findings across scientific fields are not readily replicable when the same method is repeated. Although extremely valuable, failed replications risk leaving a theoretical void— reducing confidence the original theoretical prediction is true, but not replacing it with positive evidence in favor of an alternative theory. We introduce the creative destruction approach to replication, which combines theory pruning methods from the field of management with emerging best practices from the open science movement, with the aim of making replications as generative as possible. In effect, we advocate for a Replication 2.0 movement in which the goal shifts from checking on the reliability of past findings to actively engaging in competitive theory testing and theory building.

We tested the hypothesis that White women's gender-related attitudes and beliefs, including their (i) feminist identification, (ii) views of societal gender discrimination, (iii) personal experiences with gender discrimination, and (iv) beliefs about female role models, were related to their levels of support for Hillary Clinton and her opponents (Sanders, Trump). A sample of White women (N = 314; 18–75 years, M = 32.71, SD = 13.37) recruited during June and July of 2016 from MTurk and college campuses completed surveys of their gender-related attitudes and beliefs, as well as political preferences. Results indicated that women's gender-related attitudes and beliefs predicted their views of both Clinton and Trump, after accounting for political ideology. For example, feminist identification was positively related to support for Clinton. Additionally, stronger endorsement of the notion that societal gender discrimination persists in the United States predicted both more favorable ratings of Clinton and less favorable ratings of Trump. More frequent personal experiences with discrimination, in contrast, predicted weaker support for Clinton. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","United States; election; gender relations; hypothesis testing; public attitude; race; voting behavior; womens status","","","","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","English","Anal.

In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic framework to analyze the disparate impact of a binary classification model. We view the model as a fixed channel, and quantify disparate impact as the divergence in output distributions over two groups. Our aim is to find a correction function that can perturb the input distributions of each group to align their output distributions. We present an optimization problem that can be solved to obtain a correction function that will make the output distributions statistically indistinguishable. We derive closed-form expressions to efficiently compute the correction function, and demonstrate the benefits of our framework on a recidivism prediction problem based on the ProPublica COMPAS dataset. © 2018 IEEE.","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, ISIT 2018","138713","Vail","17 June 2018 through 22 June 2018","Huawei; IEEE; IEEE InformationTheory Society; NSF; Qualcomm","English","IEEE Int Symp Inf Theor Proc","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We build on previous studies by holding both observed and unobserved characteristics of the instructor and classes constant. Our identification strategy exploits the fact that many instructors, in addition to traditional teaching in the classroom, also teach in the online environment, where attractiveness is either unknown or less salient. We utilize multiple attractiveness measures, including facial symmetry software, subjective evaluations, and a novel, proxy methodology that resembles a “Keynesian Beauty Contest.” We identify a substantial beauty premium in face-to-face classes for women but not for men. While gender on its own does not impact teaching evaluation scores, female instructors rated as more attractive receive higher instructional ratings. This result holds across several beauty measures, given a multitude of controls and while controlling for unobserved instructor characteristics and skills. Notably, the positive relationship between beauty and teaching effectiveness is not found in the online environment, suggesting the observed premium may be due to discrimination. © 2020","assessment method; gender discrimination; higher education; Internet; student; teaching","Beauty premium; College teaching; Discrimination; Gender gap; Online teaching","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Econ.

So, any gender classification system should consider this third gender also. But unfortunately there is a lack of good gender classification system which can discriminate all the three types of gender well. This proposed work uses judiciously chosen acoustic features for classification of three classes of genders from their solo voice. The proposed system has been pursued with the sampled audio data extracted from audio signal.

In the most convincing demonstrations, highly predictable nouns exert an influence on processing even before they appear to a reader or listener, as indicated by the brain's neural response to a prenominal adjective or article when it mismatches the expectations about the upcoming noun. However, recent studies suggest that some well-known demonstrations of prediction may be hard to replicate. This could signal the use of data-contingent analysis, but might also mean that readers and listeners do not always use prediction-relevant information in the way that psycholinguistic theories typically suggest. To shed light on this issue, we performed a close replication of one of the best-cited ERP studies on word anticipation (Van Berkum, Brown, Zwitserlood, Kooijman & Hagoort, 2005; Experiment 1), in which participants listened to Dutch spoken mini-stories. In the original study, the marking of grammatical gender on pre-nominal adjectives (‘groot/grote’) elicited an early positivity when mismatching the gender of an unheard, highly predictable noun, compared to matching gender. The current pre-registered study involved that same manipulation, but used a novel set of materials twice the size of the original set, an increased sample size (N = 187), and Bayesian mixed-effects model analyses that better accounted for known sources of variance than the original. In our study, mismatching gender elicited more negative voltage than matching gender at posterior electrodes. However, this N400-like effect was small in size and lacked support from Bayes Factors. In contrast, we successfully replicated the original's noun effects. While our results yielded some support for prediction, they do not support the Van Berkum et al. effect and highlight the risks associated with commonly employed data-contingent analyses and small sample sizes. Our results also raise the question whether Dutch listeners reliably or consistently use adjectival inflection information to inform their noun predictions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","adult; anticipation; Article; comprehension; electroencephalogram; event related potential; female; human; nerve potential; psycholinguistics; reading; replication study; sample size; speech discrimination","Grammatical gender; Language comprehension; Prediction; Replication","","","Jiska Koemans","Masson SpA","","","","","","English","Cortex","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this context, feminist scholars have shown how the causes and effects of the economic and financial crisis are strongly gendered. Generally, this literature suggests that crises can open a window of opportunity for gender considerations but may also promote policies which exacerbate gendered inequalities. Yet, the impact of crises on the attention to gender equality in European Union’s external relations is still unknown. This is surprising, as the European Union has promised to mainstream gender in all external policies, and understands itself to be a normative power and gender actor in world politics. This Special Issue analyses how the European Union’s identification of crisis and its policy responses to crisis in different external policy fields are gendered. The introduction situates the Special Issue within existing scholarship, theorises the central concepts of this Special Issue – crisis, gender (equality) and the European Union identities – and highlights how the different contributions advance our understanding of how gender figures in European Union’s external relations in past, current and future times of crisis. © The Author(s) 2020.","Europe; European Union; financial crisis; future prospect; gender discrimination; gender disparity; gender issue","crisis; European Union; European Union’s external relations; gender; identity; intersectionality","","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Political Stud.

Typical emotion recognition tests are assumed to be unidimensional, use pictures or videos of emotional portrayals as stimuli, and ask the participant which emotion is depicted in each stimulus. However, using actor portrayals adds a layer of difficulty in developing such a test: The portrayals may fail to be convincing and may convey a different emotion than intended. For this reason, evaluating and selecting stimuli is of crucial importance. Existing tests typically base item evaluation on consensus or expert judgment, but these methods could favor items with high agreement over items that better differentiate ability levels and they could not formally test the item pool for unidimensionality. To address these issues, the authors propose a new test, named Facial Expression Recognition Test (FERT), developed using an item response theory two-parameter logistic model. Data from 1,002 online participants were analyzed using both a unidimensional and a bifactor model, and showed that the item pool could be considered unidimensional. The selection was based on the items' discrimination parameters, retaining only the most informative items to investigate the latent ability. The resulting 36-item test was reliable and quick to administer. The authors found both a gender difference in the ability to recognize emotions and a decline of such ability with age. The PsychoPy implementation of the test and the scoring script are available on a Github repository. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Adult; Emotions; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition (Psychology); Social Perception; Social Skills; Young Adult; adult; article; consensus; decision making; facial recognition; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; sex difference; stimulus; theoretical study; validation process; emotion; facial expression; facial recognition; middle aged; neuropsychological test; perception; physiology; recognition; social competence; standards; young adult","Bayesian 2PL; Emotion detection; Emotional competence; Facial expression recognition; Item response theory","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Psychol.

We generated a prediction model estimating the conditional extra mortality risk of breast cancer patients in the Netherlands. This model can be used by life insurers to accurately estimate the additional risk of an individual patient, conditional on the years survived. Methodology All women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer in 2005–2006, treated with surgery, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. For all stages separately, multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate annual mortality risks, conditional on the years survived, until 10 years after diagnosis, resulting in 30 models. The conditional extra mortality risk was calculated by subtracting mortality rates of the general Dutch population from the patient mortality rates, matched by age, gender and year. The final model was internally and externally validated, and tested by life insurers. Results We included 23,234 patients: 10,101 stage I, 9,868 stage II and 3,265 stage III. The final models included age, tumor stage, nodal stage, lateralization, location within the breast, grade, multifocality, hormonal receptor status, HER2 status, type of surgery, axillary lymph node dissection, radiotherapy, (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy and targeted therapy. All models showed good calibration and discrimination. Testing of the model by life insurers showed that insurability using the newly-developed model increased with 13%, ranging from 0%-24% among subgroups. Conclusion The final model provides accurate conditional extra mortality risks of breast cancer patients, which can be used by life insurers to make more reliable calculations. The model is expected to increase breast cancer patients’ insurability and transparency among life insurers. © 2019 van Maaren et al.

Such undesirable behavior should not only be detected but also explained. To avoid complicated explanations and expensive fixes, fairness awareness has to be proactively embedded in the design phase of the system development. With fairness by design, system developers have to be supported with tools that detect and explain discriminations during the system architecture design [Ral8a]. Only avoiding protected characteristics in a D-MS does not prevent discrimination. Due to data correlations, other data may act as proxies for protected characteristics, thereby causing the so-called discrimination by proxy [GBM17]. There are two possible explanations for the correlations: (1) Societal fact. For instance, if females are more likely to have long hair more than males, then long hair can act as a proxy for the gender. (2) Information flow. The actual input of a D-MS may contain data that resulted from processing protected characteristics. For example, in an insurance company, it might be authorized to use the gender for identifying an insurance tariff but it might be not allowed to use gender for deciding about the reimbursement factor. However, if the insurance tariff is used as input to the reimbursement D-MS, a discrimination against gender have to be reported because the insurance tariff indirectly leaks a signal about the gender to the reimbursement D-MS. Existing works only consider two approaches: white- (e.g., [Dal7]) and black-box approaches (e.g., [GBM17]). While white box approaches can uncover discrimination, they cannot uncover discrimination in the above mentioned sense, as they did not consider possible information flow between system components. While black box approaches may solve this, they do not produce a witness to describe where and how a data flow can happen. Moreover, both approaches cannot be used in the early phase of the system design [Ral8a]. We aim to support developers with tools to reason about hidden flows for protected characteristics to a D-MS during the modeling of the system architecture. Detecting hidden information is a key challenge in security engineering [De76]. However, a model-based information flow analysis approach that supports fairness analysis is lacking [Ral8a]. We propose to develop a model-based discrimination analysis framework (see Fig. 1): Input: (i) a requirements document containing fairness requirements, (ii) a model (UML) describing the structural and behavioral aspects of a system, (ii) a database of historical data. Process: (i) Annotating a system model with fairness requirements. For this, we plan to extend the privacy UML profile in [Ahl7b]. (iii) Generating fairness constraints provided as specifications, which have to be satisfied by a system model. In this step, proxies are also identified based on historical data from the system database, (iii) Verifying the fairness constraints of step (ii) against the system model (using a model checker). The last two tasks can be realized by extending CARiSMA, a tool that provides different security checks to support model-based security analysis [Ahl7a]. Output: A witness reporting a violation. For instance, a sequence of actions that if executed will violate the fairness constraints. Other open challenges. Information flow is not the only source for discriminations. Other sources are: First, a nonalignment between the organizational needs and the system models due to misunderstandings between expert stakeholders about fairness terminologies. This challenge can benefit from the model transformation technology, as proposed in our work in [Ral7]. Second, trade-offs between fairness and privacy requirements. A privacy requirement may disallow a D-MS from accessing protected characteristics. Although this requirement sounds as a fairness support, it prevents the D-MS from being able to uncover up-to-date proxies, as a proxy identification requires accessing to protected characteristics. For this, we plan to extend our work on conflicts detection [Ral8b]. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

In these systems for the most part, the decision rules are derived by minimizing the training error on the available historical data. Therefore, if there is a bias related to a sensitive attribute such as gender, race, religion, etc. in the data, say, due to cultural/historical discriminatory practices against a certain demographic, the system could continue discrimination in decisions by including the said bias in its decision rule. We present an information theoretic framework for designing fair predictors from data, which aim to prevent discrimination against a specified sensitive attribute in a supervised learning setting. We use equalized odds as the criterion for discrimination, which demands that the prediction should be independent of the protected attribute conditioned on the actual label. To ensure fairness and generalization simultaneously, we compress the data to an auxiliary variable, which is used for the prediction task. This auxiliary variable is chosen such that it is decontaminated from the discriminatory attribute in the sense of equalized odds. The final predictor is obtained by applying a Bayesian decision rule to the auxiliary variable. © 2018 IEEE.","Decision making; Supervised learning; Automated decision making systems; Auxiliary variables; Bayesian decision rule; Discriminatory practices; Equalized odds; Fairness; Information-theoretic approach; Sensitive attribute; Information theory","Equalized odds; Fairness; Supervised learning","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS 17-18952); Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, MURI, (ARMY W911NF-15-1-0479, N00014-16-1-2804); Norsk Sykepleierforbund, NSF, (17-18952)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, ISIT 2018","138713","Vail","17 June 2018 through 22 June 2018","Huawei; IEEE; IEEE InformationTheory Society; NSF; Qualcomm","English","IEEE Int Symp Inf Theor Proc","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified 6 practices that can make schools safer for SGMY, yet few US schools implement them all. We apply a structural competency framework to elucidate factors contributing to this implementation gap. METHODS: We conducted 75 interviews and 32 focus groups with school professionals in 18 New Mexico high schools to assess factors impacting implementation of the practices over 2 years. We analyzed data using iterative coding, thematic identification techniques, and the sensitizing concept of structural competency. RESULTS: Themes included: rendering an invisible population visible; critical thinking about LGBTQ inequalities; building school personnel capacity; intersecting cultural, religious, and political conflicts; and tackling community-based sources of stigma and discrimination. Conclusions: Underlying cultural and structural forces render SGMY invisible and constrain what schools can accomplish. Professional development encouraging critical thinking about structural inequities is foundational, but efforts to close the implementation gap must attend to structural forces producing disparities for SGMY. Structural competency can strengthen the ability of the Whole School, Whole Community, and Whole Child model's cross-sector coordination of policy and process to meet the needs of every student. © 2020 The Authors.

It remains unclear whether toddlers understand the hierarchical phrase structures that determine the corresponding grammatical dependencies. We addressed this question by testing toddlers on two different phrase structures in French that govern distinct patterns of grammatical gender feature agreement. We first show that the two structures are in fact extremely infrequent in children’s input. Then we report on a preferential looking experiment in which French-learning 30-month-olds were presented with French sentences in the two structures, and the grammaticality of the feature agreement was manipulated. Crucially, the contrasting structures contained the same sequentially ordered feature-bearing words in our design (e.g., correct agreement: La banane FEMININE dans le chapeau MASCLINE, elle FEMININE … ‘The banana in the hat, it …’; incorrect agreement: *La banane FEMININE et le chapeau MASCLINE, elles FEMININE … ‘The banana and the hat, they …’). Thus, children must go beyond those words and distinguish the structures hierarchically in order to determine the grammaticality of the different agreement patterns. We predicted that if toddlers rely solely on input support to acquire the structures and the agreement, they should show no discrimination of feature grammaticality. If, however, they can rely on mechanisms beyond linear input, such as the principle of structure dependence in the universal grammar (UG), they should show a grammaticality effect. The results confirmed the latter prediction, demonstrating the possible influence of the learner’s internal system, suggesting that UG knowledge might guide early language development. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI","Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.","","","","","","English","Lang.

Thus, there is need for non-intrusive, early sex discrimination of chick embryos that is currently not being met. Hence, the motivation for the current study to investigate sex based growth difference in terms of opacity in order to classify the sex of incubated eggs. As a model, eggs from a broiler strain (ROSS 308) were sorted based on size, mass and shell color, and then incubated. During incubation an Embryonic Vital Scope, which consists of LEDs and a Si-photodiode integrated with amplifire that receives the light that passes through the egg, was used to measure average output voltage for individual eggs. After hatching feather sexing was used to determine the actual gender of the day-old chicks. A two-sample t-test was used to see the significant differences between male and female groups and gender classification model were developed using various algorithms. As the embryo became larger during incubation, the amount of transmitted light was reduced. Consequently, the opacity, the ratio of input LED current over average output voltage, increased. Male chick embryos showed higher opacity than female embryos (p-value <0.05). This method allowed us to determine the embryo gender before hatching with an accuracy of 84%. Although this method is still not 100% accurate, it is an important step towards developing an early, accurate and non-invasive means for sexing chick embryos in an industrial setting in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Infrared devices; Light emitting diodes; Signal processing; Strain; Gender classfication; Gender classification; Industrial settings; Near Infrared; Output voltages; Sex discrimination; Transmitted light; Two sample t tests; accuracy assessment; algorithm; egg; electrode; embryo; gender relations; growth; hatching; incubation; livestock farming; numerical model; sex-related difference; signal processing; Opacity","Embryonic growth; Gender classfication; Near-infrared sensing; Signal processing","","","EA Pharma Co., Ltd.; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","Comput.

For some diversity criteria at least it has been proven that they can influence the individual study success of students. The Dean’s Office of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne has empirically determined a stable prognosis parameter for study progression on the basis of selected criteria in order to enable early detection of students in need of guidance. This will then be used for targeted, diversity-oriented study guidance. On the one hand a correspondingly adapted guidance offer should take into account individual study progressions. On the other hand, measures to improve the equal opportunities of students with regard to their academic success can be discussed. Methodology: With the help of study progression analyses, study progress of cohorts can be recorded longitudinally. The study progression analysis implemented in the control of faculty teaching serves as a central forecasting and steering tool for the forthcoming concept of diversity-oriented study guidance. The significance measurement of the various features is determined using binary logistic regression analyses. Results: As part of the study progression analyses, the study success rate after the first semester has the strongest influence on the concordance with the minimum duration of study in the pre-clinical phase, followed by the characteristics age at commencement of studies and place of university entrance qualification. The school leaving grade only just misses the required significance level of p <0.05. As a predictor gender provides no explanatory contribution in the considered model. Conclusion: In order to do justice to the heterogeneity among the students, university administrators and lecturers should understand the recognition of diversity as a cross-cutting task and keep an eye on diversity-related aspects and discrimination-critical topics for different target groups as well as individual guidance services in the context of individual study guidance. Within the scope of this study, we were able to empirically prove the stable prognosis parameter study success rate after the first semester allows reliable detection of students in need of guidance. The explanatory contribution is larger than any of the individual criteria examined in this study. The specific causes that led to a delay in studying will be analyzed in the context of downstream and diversity-oriented study guidance. A follow-up study will deal with the question of whether the success of students requiring study guidance can be significantly improved by subsequent study guidance. © 2018 Karay et al.","Adult; Cultural Diversity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Prognosis; Research; Students, Medical; Universities; Young Adult; adult; cultural diversity; female; follow up; human; male; medical student; prognosis; research; university; young adult","Academic success; Diversity; Equal opportunities; Study guidance; Study progression","","","","German Medical Science GMS Publishing House","","","","","","English","GMS J.

There are an enormous amount of anti-discrimination measures available to prevent discrimination such as using some features like race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, marital status, and age besides situations like employment and training, access to public services, credit, insurance, etc. Practically, those systems are not possible to use in industries due to large datasets. Indirect discrimination contains a set of rules or techniques which are not explicitly specifying discriminatory features, deliberately or accidentally and could create unfair decisions. Existing systems have low classification accuracy and data loss with high discrimination data detection time. To overcome these limitations, an Efficient Discrimination Prevention and Rule Protection (EDPRP) approach has been proposed for removing the discrimination and protects the rule without damaging the data quality. The proposed system designing pre-processing discrimination prevention approach and specify the different features and represent to deal with direct or indirect discrimination. EDPRP is capable of preventing Indirect and direct discrimination, and it allows automatic and routine collection of large amounts of data from the public. In EDPRP, the discrimination prevention model is based on partial data sets as part of the automated decision making. Based on Experimental evaluations, proposed method improves 8% (percentages) of Support and 8 ms (milliseconds) of Execution Time compared than existing methods. © 2018, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.","","Anti-discrimination; Confidence; Discrimination; Rule generation; Rule protection; Support","","","","Intelligent Network and Systems Society","","","","","","English","Int.

Our results inform how gender and sexual orientation intersect to produce discriminatory effects in the hiring context. Heterosexual participants listened to short clips of voices that sounded like job candidate was a lesbian or heterosexual woman, or a gay or heterosexual man, and rated all for job suitability and employability. Candidates applied for jobs as leaders (Study 1), as leaders or assistants (Study 2), and for leadership roles that varied in both gender role and status (Study 3). Sexual orientation discrimination occurred in all three studies and was greater among women job candidates. Refuting role congruity theory, several findings disconfirmed the prediction that lesbian-sounding women would be advantaged when stereotyped as masculine and when applying for leadership roles. Rather, in line with status-beliefs theory, lesbian-sounding women and gay-sounding men were rated and ranked poorly to the extent that they were perceived as less competent than heterosexual candidates. Findings suggest that hiring discrimination occurs in subtle ways, such as when individuals sound gay/lesbian. This has implications for recruitment as well as sexual-orientation discrimination court cases.

Clinical decision tools are needed to identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes in order to provide individualized risk assessment and intervention. This study aimed to develop and externally validate risk prediction tools that estimate the probability of dying or of being lost to follow-up (LTF) during the year after starting ART. Methods We used a derivation cohort of 7,031 adults age 15–70 years initiating ART from 2007 to 2013 at 6 clinics in Haiti; 242 (3.5%) had documented death and 1,521 (21.6%) were LTF at 1 year after starting ART. The following routinely collected data were used as predictors in two logistic regression models (one to predict death and another to predict LTF): age, gender, weight, CD4 count, WHO Stage, and diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). The validation cohort consisted of 1,835 adults initiating ART at a different HIV clinic in Haiti during 2012. We assessed model discrimination by measuring the C-statistic, and measured model calibration by how closely the predicted probabilities approximated actual probabilities of the two outcomes. We derived a nomogram and a point-based risk score from the predictive models. Findings The model predicting death within the year after starting ART had a C-statistic of 0.75 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.81). There was no evidence for significant overfitting and the predictions were well calibrated. The strongest predictors of 1-year mortality were male gender, low weight, low CD4 count, advanced WHO stage, and the absence of TB. In the validation cohort, the C-statistic was 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.77). A point-based risk score for death had a C-statistic 0.73 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.76) and categorizes patients as low risk (<2% risk of death), average risk (3–4%), and high-risk (8–10%) and very high-risk (14–19%) with likelihood ratios to be used in settings where the baseline risk is different from our study population. The model predicting LTF did not discriminate well (C-statistic 0.59). Conclusions A simple risk-score using routinely collected data can predict 1-year mortality after ART initiation for HIV-positive adults in Haiti. However, predicting lost to follow-up using routinely collected data was not as successful. The next step is to assess whether use of this risk score can identify patients who need tailored services to reduce mortality in resource-poor settings such as Haiti. © 2018 McNairy et al.

However, many characteristics of incidental memory remain unclear, including the capacity for its conscious retrieval. Here, we examined incidental memory for faces in either upright or inverted orientation using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP). Subjects were instructed to detect a target face in a sequence of 8–15 faces cropped from natural scene photographs (Experiment 1). If the target face was identified within a brief time window, the subject proceeded to an incidental memory task. Here, subjects used incidental memory to discriminate between a probe face (a distractor in the RSVP stream) and a novel, foil face. In Experiment 2 we reduced scene-related semantic coherency by intermixing faces from multiple scenes and contrasted incidental memory with explicit memory, a condition where subjects actively memorized each face from the sequence without searching for a target. In both experiments, we measured objective performance (Type 1 AUC) and metacognitive accuracy (Type 2 AUC), revealing sustained and consciously accessible incidental memory for upright and inverted faces. In novel analyses of face categories, we examined whether accuracy or metacognitive judgments are affected by shared semantic features (i.e., similarity in gender, race, age). Similarity enhanced the accuracy of incidental memory discriminations but did not influence metacognition. We conclude that incidental memory is sustained and consciously accessible, is not reliant on scene contexts, and is not enhanced by explicit memorization. © 2018, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Adult; Consciousness; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Orientation, Spatial; Photic Stimulation; Semantics; adult; consciousness; facial recognition; female; human; male; memory; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; semantics; spatial orientation","Consciousness; Face perception; Gender; Metacognition; Short-term memory; Signal detection theory","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP160102770)","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Atten.

The construction and validation of the inventory was carried out in three stages: (1) elaboration and review of 155 items by experts; (2) a first version with 81 items applied to a sample of 2,168 people and (3) a final version of 35 items administered to 4,400 women.

Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18+ years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: Decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis. Results Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother's history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC's equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively. Conclusions Machine learning provides the chance of having a rapid predictive model using non-invasive predictors to screen for hypertension. Future research should consider improving the predictive accuracy of models in larger general populations, including more important predictors and using a variety of algorithms. © 2020 AlKaabi et al.

The original study found that participants were more likely to judge two words to be spoken by the same speaker if the words cohered lexically (created lexical compounds such as day-dream) or were phonologically related (rhymes, such as day-bay), but their study contained two limitations: (a) Same- and different-speaker trials were analyzed separately, which obscures effects of response bias, and (b) cross-gender pairs were used in the different-speaker trials, potentially inflating performance. The current study addresses these limitations by including only within-gender trials and by examining sensitivity and bias using signal detection theory. Our results not only provide support of the original study but also provide clear evidence that listeners are biased to judge two words as being produced by the same person when they share either phonological information (rhymes) or lexical-semantic coherence (compounds). Thus, the current study provides an important modified replication of previous research. © 2020 Cognitive Science Society, Inc","Discrimination, Psychological; Female; Humans; Linguistics; Male; Recognition, Psychology; Semantics; Voice; Young Adult; female; human; linguistics; male; semantics; voice; young adult","Lexical processing; Top-down processing; Voice perception","","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","English","Cogn.

Few studies have explored this emerging phenomenon in urban China. However, majority of the researchers have focused on return behavior based on the “pull–push forces” theory defined by national and urban macro-factors. Less attention has been paid to the individual factors that cause migrants’ return, e.g., social ties and capital, perceived discrimination and exclusion, social integration, and place attachment. To fill this gap, this study examines the determinants of the new-generation migrants’ return intentions and location choices based on the following two micro-level aspects: “objective attributes” and “subjective perceptions.” Using the data collected from the 2014 National Floating Population Dynamic Monitoring Survey and binary and multiple nominal logistic regression models, this study focused on three types of new-generation migrants (born after 1980): skilled migrants, business migrants, and labor migrants in four cities (Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Zhongshan). The results can be given as follows. 1) New-generation migrants in urban China exhibited a strong intention to return, and their location choices differed based on their types. Further, 40% of migrants returned to their household region. Labor migrants exhibited the strongest intention (43.7%), followed by business migrants (36.0%) and skilled migrants (27.9%). Proportionately more skilled migrants planned to return to provincial capitals or prefectural cities when compared with the other two cohorts. 2) Binary logistic models identified return determinants; new-generation migrants’ returning intentions were influenced by both the “objective attributes” (demographical and economic condition) and “subjective perceptions” (economic position perception and sociopsychological perception). Males exhibited a greater probability of returning when compared with that exhibited by females. Age, education level, monthly income, and years of leaving hometowns were negatively related with the migrants’ return intentions. Long working hours per day contributed to their return. No evidence has shown that the marital status, number of children under the age of 18, or contract form were significantly related. As for the subjective factors, migrants with high family-related mental burdens and strong native cultural identification were increasingly likely to return. Strong social acculturation caused new-generation migrants to settle down in their destination cities. Importantly, there was no direct link between the migrants’ return intentions and perception of economic position. 3) Regarding determinants in local choices, education level was the most significant factor associated with migrants’ backflow to provincial capitals. Sociopsychological perceptions strongly influenced their backflow to prefectural cities. Demographic factors, such as gender, age, and years of leaving hometowns, exhibited a close relation with returning to counties or townships. Notably, migrants with high monthly incomes exhibited a greater probability of returning to urban settlements when compared with rural areas. This study confirmed that individual factors, particularly sociopsychological perceptions, have an important effect on the new-generation migrants’ return behaviors in urban China. Therefore, we initially call for the government to articulate the significance of social acculturation and integration, targeting the new-generation migrants to avoid “reverse culture shock” in backflow settlements, notably in prefectural cities. Second, the improvement of public services, such as medical care, pension, and children enrollment opportunities, as well as favorable policies and practices should be considered in urban development and planning and established to relieve the migrants’ family burden. © 2020 Tropical Geography.

A prediction model could potentially support such treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a model for aneurysm rupture based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters, aneurysm location, and patient gender and age. Methods: Cross-sectional data from 1061 patients were used for image-based computational fluid dynamics and shape characterization of 1631 aneurysms for training an aneurysm rupture probability model using logistic group Lasso regression. The model’s discrimination and calibration were internally validated based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and calibration plots. Results: The final model retained 11 hemodynamic and 12 morphological variables, aneurysm location, as well as patient age and gender. An adverse hemodynamic environment characterized by a higher maximum oscillatory shear index, higher kinetic energy and smaller low shear area as well as a more complex aneurysm shape, male gender and younger age were associated with an increased rupture risk. The corresponding AUC of the model was 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.86], after correction for optimism 0.84). Conclusion: The model combining variables from various domains was able to discriminate between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms with an AUC of 86%. Internal validation indicated potential for the application of this model in clinical practice after evaluation with longitudinal data. © 2018, CARS.","Adult; Aged; Aneurysm, Ruptured; Area Under Curve; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Probability; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Young Adult; adult; anterior communicating artery aneurysm; Article; brain artery aneurysm; brain artery aneurysm rupture; calibration; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; geometry; hemodynamics; human; image analysis; internal carotid artery aneurysm; internal validity; Lasso regression; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; priority journal; probability; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; aged; aneurysm rupture; area under the curve; biological model; hemodynamics; intracranial aneurysm; validation study; young adult","Cerebral aneurysm; Hemodynamics; Prediction; Risk factors; Rupture; Shape","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, (R21NS094780)","Springer Verlag","","","","","","English","Int.

Cold and warm detection threshold (CDT&WDT), cold and heat pain threshold (CPT&HPT), mechanical detection and pain threshold (MDT&MPT), pressure pain threshold (PPT) and two-point discrimination (2PD) were measured at five sites: bilateral subauricular and postauricular sites (LA, RA, LB, RB) and the dorsum of left hand (control). Pressure stimulation was applied at each of the four periauricular test sites. The test-retest reliability of the QST data implied fair to excellent agreement as evaluated by the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC; all >0.4) for different days. There was no difference between each side in the QST parameters and mechanical sensitivity mapping (P ≥ 0.057). Significant differences between subauricular and postauricular sites were shown for WDT and PPT (P ≤ 0.028).

When used with sexual and/or gender minority individuals, ecomaps provide a baseline for discussion of relational processes, disruptions in family and social relationships, experiences of homophobia and discrimination tied to specific individuals, and the relationship individuals and their families have with other social systems.

In order to inform treatment and prevention, the purpose of this study was to examine behavioral and health-related patterns among lesbian women and elucidate how these patterns are associated with general discrimination, sexual minority stress, affect, and social support. A sample of self-identified lesbian women (N = 436) completed an online survey from August 2014–March 2015. A latent profile analysis was conducted using measures of body mass index, hazardous alcohol use, binge eating, eating disorder risk, and exercise as indicators. A 5-class solution best fit the data and included two healthy groups: (a) low health risk, moderate exercise (54%), (b) low health risk + high exercise (22%); and three unhealthy risk groups: (c) obese + binge eating (14%); (d) disordered eating + hazardous alcohol use (5%); (e) disordered eating + high exercise (5%). The three unhealthy classes generally reported more general discrimination, sexual minority stress, social anxiety, negative affect, and lower social support compared to the healthy classes. These findings show that behavioral and health-related variables cluster together in several distinct patterns among lesbian women. In addition, general discrimination and sexual minority stress and associated psychosocial functioning may be related to these maladaptive behavioral and health-related patterns and may be important to consider in behavioral interventions. © 2018","Adolescent; Adult; Binge-Eating Disorder; Exercise; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Heterosexuality; Homosexuality, Female; Humans; Risk Factors; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; alcohol consumption; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Article; binge eating disorder; body mass; controlled study; Eating Disorder Inventory Bulimia Scale; Everyday Discrimination Scale; exercise; female; gender identity; health behavior; health hazard; human; international physical activity questionnaire; intervention study; Lesbian Gay and Bisexual Identity Scale; LGBT people; Likert scale; Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support; physical activity; psychological rating scale; questionnaire; risk factor; social support; State Social Anxiety Questionnaire; stress; adolescent; binge eating disorder; eating disorder; heterosexuality; lesbianism; psychology; sexual and gender minority; young adult","disordered eating; empirical classification; hazardous alcohol use; obesity","","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","English","Behav.

The goal of this study is to explore how social isolation and depression affect cisgender women living with HIV in Hyderabad, India. Sixteen cisgender women living with HIV were asked to complete in-depth interviews regarding their experiences with HIV stigma and depression. All interviews were digitally audio-recorded in Hindi or Telugu, then translated, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis by two to three coders. Three main themes emerged from the qualitative interviews among these cisgender women living with HIV: (1) “They kept away”: Experiences with social isolation; (2) “I thought people would think badly about me”: Perceived experiences of discrimination; and (3) “I will live till I die”: Suicidality, resilience, and gaining hope. Our findings reinforce the need for emphasis on culturally appropriate interventions for depression for cisgender women living with HIV in India, including greater access to mental health resources, greater availability of trained counselors that share the same gender and are native speakers of Hindi or Telugu, and increased family and community support for socially isolated individuals. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Depression; HIV; Hyderabad; India; Social isolation; Stigma","","","Council on Social Work Education, CSWE","Springer","","","","","","English","Clin.

In this study, eight SNP-STRs were selected, and a stable and sensitive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for amplifying these SNP-STRs and the Amelogenin gender marker according to the principle of amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). This novel multiplex set allows detection of the minor DNA contributor in a DNA mixture of any gender and cellular origin with high resolution (beyond a DNA ratio of 1:20). In addition, SNP-STR haplotype frequencies were estimated based on a survey of 350 unrelated individuals from Chinese Han population, and the combined power of discrimination (PD) and power of exclusion (PE) of the eight SNP-STRs were calculated as 0.99999999965 and 0.9996, which were obviously higher than that of the eight STR loci: 0.9999999954 and 0.9989 respectively. The results indicated that the SNP-STR compound markers have higher application value in forensic identification compared to standard autosomal STRs, especially in the analysis of imbalanced DNA mixtures. © 2018 Wei et al.

Moreover, GID is classified as a psychiatric condition. The classification is inherently stigmatizing. Yet, should GID disappear from diagnostic manuals, access to publicly funded medical treatment could be restricted. In order to understand how gender variance should be understood and treated, we should understand what 'gender' is, and what a 'normal' versus an 'abnormal' gender development and identification are. This essay puts some order in the vast literature on sex and gender development and identification. It discusses the notion of gender, and explores the vexed question of whether gender is a primarily biological or psychological acquisition.

However, current end stage renal failure (ESRF) risk stratification tools are complex and not validated in multi-ethnic Asians. We hence aimed to develop an ESRF risk prediction model by taking into account ethnic differences within a fairly homogenous socioeconomic setting and using parameters readily accessible to primary care clinicians managing the vast majority of patients with CKD. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of 1970 adults with CKD estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73m                             2                              or albuminuria >30 mg/g from the population-based Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study (n = 10,033). Outcome was incident ESRF, ascertained by linkage to the Singapore Renal Registry until 2015. Results Mean follow up was 8.5 ± 1.8 years and ESRF occurred in 32 individuals (1.6%). ESRF incidence rates were 2.8, 0.8 and 2.6 per 1000 patient years in Malays, Indians and Chinese respectively. The best ESRF prediction model included age, gender, eGFR and albuminuria (calibration χ2 = 0.45, P = 0.93; C-statistic 0.933, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.889–0.978, p = 0.01; AIC 356). Addition of ethnicity improved discrimination marginally (C statistic 0.942, 95% CI 0.903–0.981, p = 0.21). Addition of clinical variables such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia did not improve model performance significantly. Conclusion We affirmed the utility of commonly available clinical information (age, gender, eGFR and UACR) in prognosticating ESRF for multi-ethnic Asians with CKD.                          © 2019 Lim et al.

Following the Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA), we examined whether men’s identification with women would predict their allied collective action, alongside moral convictions, efficacy, and anger. We also examined whether identification with their own ingroup would decrease their willingness to improve women’s situation. We tested the SIMCA, extended to consider ingroup identification among men, in Japan (N = 103) and the Philippines (N = 131). Consistent with the SIMCA, moral convictions and group efficacy predicted men’s willingness to engage in collective action to fight discrimination against women. However, anger was not significant, and identification with the advantaged and disadvantaged groups played different roles in the two countries.

The scoring system considered seven variables: gender, age, tumor size, microcalcification, resistance index >0.7, multiple nodular lesions, and extrathyroid extension. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.742, indicating a good discrimination. Using 5 points as a diagnostic threshold, the validation results for validation group had an AUC of 0.758, indicating good discrimination and consistency in the scoring system.

This Essay analyzes the bifurcated faculty as a personnel practice, leveraging insights from management theory and employment discrimination scholarship to evaluate law schools as employers. It considers, first, the rise of new economy management practices that eschew static job classifications in favor of greater flexibility and integration and, second, the role of structural discrimination in stymying institutional efforts to eliminate workplace disparities tied to race, gender, and other protected characteristics. These bodies of research suggest that law schools aspiring to graduate practice-ready lawyers must not only integrate their curricula but also their faculty. Doing so means eliminating structural obstacles that isolate skills faculty from doctrinal faculty and dislodging embedded assumptions about their relative worth. Law schools that are seriously committed to graduating practice-ready lawyers should adopt a unified tenure system that hires, evaluates, and promotes all faculty based on the quality of their teaching and scholarship regardless of the subject of their courses or their area of research. © 2020 Temple University.

Growing evidence suggests that LGBTQ people in STEM are statistically underrepresented, encounter non-supportive environments, and leave STEM at an alarming rate. Potential factors driving LGBTQ disparities in STEM include bias and discrimination, misalignments of occupational interests with STEM stereotypes, and STEM norms of impersonality that isolate LGBTQ people. LGBTQ retention shares common psychological processes with female and racial minority retention such as STEM identification and belonging. The key barrier to better understanding and addressing LGBTQ challenges in STEM is the lack of sexual orientation or gender identity (SO/GI) demographic data on the U.S. STEM workforce. Policy recommendations include (a) adding SO/GI measures to federal STEM-census surveys; (b) broadening agencies’ definition of underrepresented groups to include LGBTQ people; and (c) incorporating LGBTQ identity into accountability systems and diversity programs at STEM institutions. © The Author(s) 2020.","","disparities; education; LGBTQ; science; STEM; workforce","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","Policy Insights Behav.

Previous studies of DRF have examined rater bias using manifest variables (e.g., use of covariates) to determine the subgroups. These manifest variables include gender and the ethnicity of the examinee. For example, a rater may score males more severely. Ideally, each rater’s severity should be invariant across subgroups. This study examines DRF in the context of latent subgroups that classify possible sources of DRF based on raters’ scoring behavior rather than manifest factors. An extension of the latent class signal detection theory (LC-SDT) model for identifying DRF is proposed and examined using real-world data and simulations. Results from real-world data show that the signal detection approach leads to an effective method to identify latent DRF. Simulations with varying sample sizes and conditions of rater precision were shown to recover parameters at an adequate level, supporting its use to identify latent DRF in large-scale data. These findings suggest that the DRF extension of the LC-SDT can be a useful model to examine characteristics of raters and add information that can aid rater training. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bias; Humans; Models, Statistical; Signal Detection, Psychological; Writing; adult; article; male; sample size; signal detection; simulation; theoretical study; human; perceptive discrimination; statistical bias; statistical model; writing","differential rater functioning; Latent class signal detection theory; mixture item response theory","","","","Routledge","","","","","","English","Multivariate Behav.

Method: EMs were recorded in a father and his son (both diagnosed with CP) and controls (N = 2). In the identification tasks they watched personally familiar faces and distracters and responded by saying the names of the familiar faces or saying ""I don't know."" Two discrimination tasks were added to distinguish the specificity of the EM pattern for the recognition tasks. In all tasks, faces were presented 1 by 1 until the response onset; thus, the EM pattern was not saturated by overexposure to the stimulus. The 1st fixation position was examined to localize the 1st area of the face attended to. The spatial-temporal fixation pattern was examined to evaluate the attention devoted to specific regions. Results: Both family members were inaccurate and slower than controls in the identification but not the discrimination tasks. In all tasks, they made a number of fixations comparable to those of controls but showed longer fixation durations than controls did. In the identification tasks, they showed poor spatial-temporal distribution of fixations on the eyes and rare 1st fixations on the eyes. Conclusions: Consistent with the literature, both family members showed the typical reduced sampling of the eyes. Nevertheless, our protocol based on explicit verbal responses (which included EM only until response onset) showed that they did not increase the spatial sampling overall by making more fixations than controls did. Instead, they showed longer fixation durations across tasks; this was interpreted as a generalized problem with face processing in affording a more robust sampling of information. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Adult; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Child; Eye; Eye Movement Measurements; Eye Movements; Facial Recognition; Fathers; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Male; Nose; Prosopagnosia; adult; age decision; Article; child; clinical article; congenital disorder; congenital prosopagnosia; controlled study; eye movement; gender decision; human; latent period; male; measurement accuracy; perceptive discrimination; preschool child; priority journal; prosopagnosia; single fixation duration; task performance; vocal response latency; attention; case control study; eye; eye fixation; eye movement; facial recognition; father; nose; oculography; pathophysiology; physiology; prosopagnosia","Congenital prosopagnosia; Developmental prosopagnosia; Eye movements; Familiar face recognition; First fixation position","","","Italian Ministry of Health; Ministero della Salute","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Neuropsychology","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It shows that while poverty is at the core of social exclusion, it is often exacerbated by prejudices and discriminations, which follow on from differences of class, gender, age, ethnicity, disability, and social location-for instance: natives versus outsiders.

This focuses on linguistic and socio-cognitive approaches in order to deal with two issues: 1) construction and validation of expert knowledge, and, 2) classification and categorization of people. The results show that discursive strategies followed by practitioners support stereotypes about profiles and skills valued, on the one hand, and prejudices related to class and gender, on the other hand.

The unexplained part of the gender pay gap gave us information about the wage discrimination. Second, we extended the decomposition procedure to different quantile points along the whole income distribution. To construct the counterfactual distribution, we used the recentered influence function—regression approach.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)and N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are widely recognized outcome-predicting factors for patients with heart failure (HF).This study derived external validation of a risk score to predict 1-year mortality after discharge in hospitalized patients with HF using the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC)program data. We also assessed the effect of adding BNP or NT-proBNP to this risk score model in a Korean HF registry population. Method and results We included 5625 patients from the Korean acute heart failure registry (KorAHF) and excluded those who died in hospital. The MAGGIC constructed a risk score to predict mortality in patients with HF by using 13 routinely available patient characteristics (age, gender, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), HF diagnosed within the last 18 months, current smoker, NYHA class, use of beta blocker, ACEI or ARB, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, creatinine, and EF). We added BNP or NT-proBNP, which are the most important biomarkers, to the MAGGIC risk scoring system in patients with HF. The outcome measure was 1-year mortality. In multivariable analysis, BNP or NT-proBNP independently predicted death. The risk score was significantly varied between alive and dead groups (30.61 ± 6.32 vs. 24.80 ± 6.81, p < 0.001). After the conjoint use of BNP or NTproBNP and MAGGIC risk score in patients with HF, a significant difference in risk score was noted (31.23 ± 6.46 vs. 25.25 ± 6.96, p < 0.001).The discrimination abilities of the risk score model with and without biomarker showed minimal improvement (C index of 0.734 for MAGGIC risk score and 0.736 for MAGGIC risk score plus BNP or NT-proBNP, p = 0.0502) and the calibration was found good. However, we achieved a significant improvement in net reclassification and integrated discrimination for mortality (NRI of 33.4%,p < 0.0001 and IDI of 0.002, p < 0.0001). Conclusion In the KorAHF, the MAGGIC project HF risk score performed well in a large nationwide contemporary external validation cohort. Furthermore, the addition of BNP or NT-proBNPto the MAGGIC risk score was beneficial in predicting more death in hospitalized patients with HF. © 2018 Khanam et al.

A machine learning model trained based on biased data tends to make unfair predictions for users from minority groups. Although this problem has been studied before, existing methods mainly aim to detect and control the dependency effect of the protected variables (e.g. race, gender) on target prediction based on a large amount of training data. These approaches carry two major drawbacks that (1) lacking showing a global cause-effect visualization for all variables; (2) lacking generalization of both accuracy and fairness to unseen tasks. In this work, we first discover discrimination from data using a causal Bayesian knowledge graph which not only demonstrates the dependency of the protected variable on target but also indicates causal effects between all variables. Next, we develop a novel algorithm based on risk difference in order to quantify the discriminatory influence for each protected variable in the graph. Furthermore, to protect prediction from unfairness, a fast-adapted bias-control approach in meta-learning is proposed, which efficiently mitigates statistical disparity for each task and it thus ensures independence of protected attributes on predictions based on biased and few-shot data samples. Distinct from existing meta-learning models, group unfairness of tasks are efficiently reduced by leveraging the mean difference between (un)protected groups for regression problems. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate that our proposed unfairness discovery and prevention approaches efficiently detect discrimination and mitigate biases on model output as well as generalize both accuracy and fairness to unseen tasks with a limited amount of training samples. © 2020 IEEE.","Forecasting; Graph algorithms; Knowledge representation; Turing machines; Historical data; Knowledge graphs; Machine learning models; Meta-learning models; Minority groups; Novel algorithm; Regression problem; Target prediction; Learning systems","Bias discovery and prevention; Causal Bayesian network; Fairness generalization; Fewshot meta-learning; Statistic parity","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (1750911, 1815696)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","11th IEEE International Conference on Knowledge Graph, ICKG 2020","163030","Virtual, Nanjing","9 August 2020 through 11 August 2020","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Method: The study followed the example of the Englishcoordinate response measure (E-CRM) speech corpus anddesigned a Chinese version. Sixteen listeners were recruitedfor a monaural Mandarin speech recognition test usingC-CRM materials in 5 competing speech masker conditions:1-talker different-gender, 1-talker same-gender, and 2-, 4-,and 8-talker maskers. Both the MAT and the method ofconstant stimuli (MCS) were used and then compared. Results: Results of the MCS revealed that Mandarinlisteners’ psychometric functions varied depending uponmasker characteristics (e.g., the number and gender oftalkers), because significant differences were suggestedamong the 5 masker conditions (mainly between 1-talkerand multitalker), as measured in the slope b and the 50%threshold. Meanwhile, speech identification improvedmonotonically with increasing signal-to-noise ratios for all5 masker conditions, except that a plateau was observedwith signal-to-noise ratios from −10 to 0 dB in the 1-talkermaskers. The properties of C-CRM psychometric functionslargely agreed with E-CRM findings, and yet lower speechrecognition thresholds were found in C-CRM. Meanwhile,the comparisons of the thresholds estimated in the MATand the MCS showed no significant differences for all5 masker conditions. Conclusion: The results suggest that masker characteristicsgreatly affected Mandarin psychometric functions andmonotonicity was present in all 5 C-CRM maskers,echoing the E-CRM literature in a great extent. Interestingly,target words of C-CRM were found easier to recognize inmultitalker babbles than those of E-CRM. Moreover,comparisons of the MAT and the MCS suggest that theMAT provided a feasible method for measuring Mandarinspeech recognition thresholds with the C-CRM speechmaskers. © 2019 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

We sought to understand factors that influence the development of sustained attention, by looking at the relationship between childhood adversity and adult sustained attention. Participants, Setting, and Methods: Participants were 5,973 TestMyBrain.org visitors from English-speaking countries who completed a continuous performance task (gradCPT) of sustained attention and a childhood adversity questionnaire. We analyzed gradCPT performance using a signal detection approach. Results: Discrimination ability (the main metric of performance on the gradCPT) was associated with total childhood adversity load, even when controlling for covariates related to age, gender, parental education, race, country of origin, and relative socioeconomic status (β = −0.079, b = −0.032). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that attention differences related to childhood adversity exposure can (1) be measured using brief, performance-based measures of sustained attention, (2) persist into adulthood, and (3) be detected at the population level. These results, paired with the well-documented associations between sustained attention and psychopathology, indicate that sustained attention may be an important mechanism for understanding early influences on mental health. © Copyright © 2020 Vogel, Esterman, DeGutis, Wilmer, Ressler and Germine.","","childhood adversity; cognition; population-based; psychopathology; sustained attention","","","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","English","Front.

State homophobia allows the criminal justice system to orchestrate a legal repression of homosexuals with the aim of building a heterosexist society. In this paper, I show that the reality is more complex and should be apprehended on several levels. First of all, the legal repression of homosexuals is a recent phenomenon. Secondly, the criminal justice system displays several attitudes towards homosexuals ranging from systematic arrests to the subcontracting of state violence. Finally, the hesitations of the Senegalese government to formally criminalize homosexuality and the informal support given to homosexuals rights organizations encourage the relativism of the homophobic nature of the state of Senegal. © 2020 Editions de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.

We develop a rigorous framework of multiaccuracy auditing and post-processing to improve predictor accuracy across identifiable subgroups. Our algorithm, Multiaccuracy Boost, works in any setting where we have black-box access to a predictor and a relatively small set of labeled data for auditing. We prove guarantees on the convergence rate of the algorithm and show that it improves overall accuracy at each step. Importantly, if the initial model is accurate on an identifiable subgroup, then the post-processed model will be also. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on diverse applications in image classification, finance, and population health. Multiaccuracy Boost can improve subpopulation accuracy (e.g. for “black women”) even when the sensitive features (e.g. “race”, “gender”) are not known to the algorithm. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The disparity index is calculated to examine the gender gap in literacy whereas the correlation coefficient is used to ascertain its relationship with major determinants. Though the country and the state have achieved a reputed position with the literacy rate of 74.04 and 75.55 per cent respectively in 2011 yet inequality in the learning of male-female is a matter of concern for both entities. The figure for the district Mewat (which also lies at bottom in overall literacy as per ongoing census data) shows more discrimination in male-female learning, as here the male literacy rate is approximate to the double (69.97 per cent versus 36.60 per cent) of the females. To some extent, in areas like Mewat, Palwal and Fatehabad this discrimination is an outcome of societal stances, religion, fiscal or ethnical determinants and cultural stereotype as these factors of the environs have a direct or indirect association with literacy. So to ensure the equality and quality in education in basic or compulsory education, there is a need for massive investment on resources with communal awareness regarding significance as well as claptrap obstacles in the way of the learning.  © 2020 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.","","Disparity index and cultural stereotype; Inequality; Literacy; Social stances","","","","Gadjah Mada University","","","","","","English","Indones.

Dimensions of nasal bone is one such parameter that can be used to determine sex. The main aim of the study is to compare the morphological measures of nasal bone between genders using computed tomography. Method: Retrospective study including the patients visiting the Dept. of Radio-diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Hospital, Manipal. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria 240 subjects (120 males and 120 females) who were referred for routine CT OMC were included in the study. The axial sections were converted into coronal and sagittal slices using the multiplanar reconstruction tool. Three anthropometric parameters were measured. Results: A total of 240 (120 males and 120 females) data was obtained with age group ranging from 20-50 years. Mean and Standard deviation was calculated. The data was normally distributed hence independent sample T test was performed to find the difference between males and females. Null hypothesis stated that there was no significant difference based on the anthropometric measurements between the males and females since the (p>0.05). Alternate hypothesis stated that there is significant difference noted between the males and females as (p<0.001). Conclusion: In present study, three measurements of the nasal bone were taken such as the nasofrontal angle, pyramidal angle and the linear distance out of which two variables i.e. the pyramidal angle and the linear distance were good discriminators which contributed high accuracy in comparison to the other parameter. © 2020, Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology.

Additionally, LGBTIQ people can be sampled in almost any research. However, it is usually assumed that all study participants are heterosexual and cisgender. In consequence, a limited number of categories for LGBTIQ individuals are typically included in questionnaires. Such an approach results in biased sample characteristics, which can both affect the interpretation of results and provoke LGBTIQ participants to refrain from providing answers to certain questions or refuse further participation. In addition, it represents a violation of the scientific research ethical principle of avoiding discrimination or privilege based on sex, gender identity, and expression or sexual orientation. In this paper, recommendations are offered for research that acknowledges LGBTIQ people by including different response options for sexual orientation, sex, and gender identity. These recommendations are based on an overview of different theoretical explanations and approaches in the measurement of gender, sex and sexual orientation in Croatian and international research, as well as on the authors’ experience in professional work with LGBTIQ people. As a possible step towards recognising LGBTIQ identities, introducing questions about sexual orientation and gender identity into research is recommended where those variables could be relevant for the studied subject. Also, since sex is a frequent research variable and commonly used response options “male” and “female” do not apply to a part of the population, adding a response option for self-identification or “something else” is recommended.

Using novel ML techniques, these algorithms are able to process massive amounts of data and make highly accurate predictions; however, their inherent complexity makes it increasingly difficult for humans to understand why certain decisions were made. Indeed, these algorithms are black-box decision makers: their underlying decision processes are either hidden from human scrutiny by proprietary law, or (as is often the case) their inner workings are so complicated that even their own designers will be hard-pressed to explain the underlying reasoning behind their decision making processes. By obfuscating their function, data-driven classifiers run the risk of exposing human stakeholders to risks. These may include incorrect decisions (e.g. a loan application that was wrongly rejected due to system error), information leaks (e.g. an algorithm inadvertently uses information it should not have used), or discrimination (e.g. biased decisions against certain ethnic or gender groups). Government bodies and regulatory authorities have recently begun calling for algorithmic transparency: providing human-interpretable explanations of the underlying reasoning behind large-scale decision making algorithms. My thesis research will be concerned with an axiomatic analysis of automatically generated explanations of such classifiers. Especially, I'm interested in how to decide which explanation of a decision to trust given that there are many, potentially conflicting, possible explanations for any given decision. © 2018 Author.","Laws and legislation; Learning systems; Philosophical aspects; Automatically generated; Axiomatic approach; Computer generated; Data-driven algorithm; Decision making process; Decision-making algorithms; Inherent complexity; Regulatory authorities; Decision making","axiomatic approach; explainable machine learning","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","1st AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, AIES 2018","144126","New Orleans","2 February 2018 through 3 February 2018","AAAI; ACM SIGAI","English","AIES - Proc.

The literature provides contradictory predictions about the effects of a relationship with an affluent employer on a vulnerable employed woman and her household. Using data from the 2002–8 General Household Survey, this study uses propensity score matching (PSM) to compare paid domestic workers versus employed women with similar labor market characteristics. It finds that the household members of paid domestic workers tend to have a lower likelihood of unemployment, lower unemployment duration, higher likelihood of owning assets, and lower prevalence of hunger. It is, however, important to see evidence of such benefits in the context of a complicated employment relationship and to highlight that such benefits can reflect both altruistic and self-serving employer motivations. © 2018, © 2018 IAFFE.","","Domestic workers; economic development; gender discrimination; inequality; low-wage employment; South Africa","","","","Routledge","","","","","","English","Fem.

Whereas their utility is uncontested, these paradigms are subject to limitations inherent in their block-based design, such as allowing assessment of only a single belief at a time. We introduce the Propositional Evaluation Paradigm (PEP) for assessment of multiple propositional beliefs within a single experimental block. Two experiments provide first evidence for the PEP’s validity. In Experiment 1, endorsement of racist beliefs measured with the PEP was related to criterion variables such as explicit racism assessed via questionnaire and indicators of behavioral tendencies. Experiment 2 indicates that the PEP’s implicit racism scores may predict actual behavior over and above explicit, self-report measures. Finally, Experiment 3 tested the PEP’s applicability in the domain of hiring discrimination. Whereas general PEP-based gender stereotypes were not related to hiring bias, results suggest a possible role of female stereotypes in hiring discrimination. In the context of these findings, we discuss both the potential and possible challenges in adopting the PEP to different beliefs. In sum, these initial findings suggest that the PEP may offer researchers a reliable and easily administrable option for the indirect assessment of propositional evaluations. © Copyright © 2019 Müller and Rothermund.","","attitudes; implicit measures; PEP; propositional beliefs; racism","","","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","English","Front.

Mortality due to amebiasis is mostly by extra intestinal infections, amebic liver abscess being the most common one. This study was conducted to determine the current epidemiological status, risk factors, associated microflora and strain variation of E. histolytica causing liver abscesses. Methods/Findings A total of 115 liver abscess cases comprising of 107 (93%) males and 8 (6.9%) females were included in the study. Microscopic examination of pus samples from the abscesses and species discrimination using nested multiplex PCR showed the presence of E. histolytica in 101 (87.5%) cases. Data collected by face to face interviews using a pre tested questionnaire suggested intake of untreated drinking water (ORs: 6.4, p = 0.002), habit of alcohol consumption (ORs: 4.0, p = 0.019) and lack of urban services (ORs: 0.08, p = 0.017) to be major risk factors associated with E. histolytica infections. The study of associated bacterial flora through aerobic culture of liver aspirates and conventional PCR for detection of anaerobes revealed the presence of Fusobacterium (19, 25.5%), Peptococcus (19, 25.5%), Prevotella (18, 24.3%), Bacteroides (8, 10.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (3, 4%), Escherichia coli (2, 2.7%), Peptostreptococcus (2, 2.7%), Clostridium (2, 2.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1, 1.3%). Further to study the clonality, genotyping of E. histolytica targeting six tRNA-linked polymorphic STR loci (A-L, D-A, N-K, R-R, STGA -D and S-Q) was carried out which showed the presence of 89 different genotypes in the liver aspirate samples. Conclusion The findings highlight the high prevalence of genetically diverse E. histolytica from the liver abscess cases in this geographical region. Low socio-economic status and habit of alcohol consumption were important predictors of amebic liver abscess. © 2019 Singh et al.

Generally the first step of diagnosis of sleep disorder is to be Polysomnography (PSG) test.The PSG test is a formal method to diagnose sleep disorders, during this test we have considered many biomedical signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG),electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG).Sleep Stage classification (SSC) process is time taking and there must be a presence of sleep experts or technicians definitely to be stay with subject through the whole recording time period, which is somehow overburden for clinicians and it may hamper sometime to record the correct results from subjects. For that reason now researchers obtained Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC) methods in order to find disturbances during sleep and it's quite faster and efficient in towards data recording accuracy from PSG signals.Method: In this study, we have proposed an alternative approach for sleep stage scoring by considering different age subjects from same gender with their optimal features. In this proposed study we have considered dual channels of EEG signals such as C4-A1 and O2-A1. In data pre-processing stage, the datasets were analyzed and normalized using feature extraction and feature selection methods. The main important part of this research work is to be comparing between dual channels and its accuracy of best discrimination in between wake and sleep stages. In addition, we have obtained three base classifier such as support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). In addition we have also adopted ensemble classifier (Boosting), to make a proper comparison the classification performances in between them. For validation purpose in between training data and test data, we have used 10-fold cross validation techniques.Results: In this study, we have made a comparison the performances in terms channel effectiveness and classification algorithm effectiveness with regard to discriminate in between the sleep stages. As per outcome from the proposed system the SVM classification techniques achieved best accuracy in comparable to other classifiers.Regading to channel effectiveness, C4-A1 recording is more appropriate for sleep stage scoring.Discussion and Conclusion: As per the related research work in this field , the introduced approach in the present study achieved an acceptable performance in sleep scoring in order to classifying wake stage and sleep stage from dual channels of EEG signals. Our experiment design compares the accuracy of classification in between two channels and find out which channel recordings and classification techniques to be most effective in towards classifying sleep stages. In future its performance to be increase through proper enhancing through different intelligent techniques in related to process of diagnosing and treatment of sleep disorders.  © 2020 IEEE.","Bioelectric phenomena; Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Data handling; Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Formal methods; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Wakes; Accuracy of classifications; Classification algorithm; Classification performance; Classification technique; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Feature selection methods; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Non-communicable disease; Sleep research","Classification; EEG signal; Machine Learning; Sleep Stages","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","6th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies, CONECCT 2020","163207","Bangalore","2 July 2020 through 4 July 2020","Ansys; Entuple Technologies; IEEE Humanitarian Activities Committee","English","Proc.

As few discrimination measures function across multiple social identities or positions, we developed the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI) for intercategorical intersectionality research, including measures of Anticipated (InDI-A), Day-to-Day (InDI-D), and Major (InDI-M) discrimination that do not require attribution to particular grounds. Methods: We conducted a validity and reliability study with 2016 online survey panel data from Canada and the United States (n = 2583). Internal consistency and dimensionality of the InDI-A were evaluated with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Construct validation included known-groups comparisons, associations with psychological distress, and convergence with existing discrimination measures. Test-retest reliability was examined in a subgroup (n = 150). Results: We found support for use of the InDI-A as a unidimensional scale. As hypothesized, racial and sexual/gender minorities reported higher frequencies of all discrimination types (all p < 0.001), and discrimination varied across intersectional categories. Each InDI component was significantly positively associated with psychological distress after controlling for potential confounders. Frequency scores were strongly positively correlated with existing scales. Intraclass correlation coefficients for test-retest reliability of anticipated, lifetime day-to-day, and lifetime major discrimination ranged from 0.70 to 0.72. Conclusions: Final InDI measures include the 9-item InDI-A, 9–item InDI-D, and 13-item InDI-M, for which we have found initial evidence of construct validity and reliability. In combination with sociodemographic information, the InDI measures can be used to evaluate the role of discrimination as a mediator of intersectional health inequalities, and to monitor the prevalence and impacts of discrimination in heterogeneous populations. © 2018 The Author(s)","Adult; Canada; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Population Health; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Social Discrimination; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Canada; United States; equity; health status; heterogeneity; measurement method; psychology; racism; survey; article; Canada; construct validity; controlled study; correlation coefficient; exploratory research; factor analysis; female; health disparity; homophobia; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; mediator; mental stress; prevalence; racism; sexual and gender minority; social status; test retest reliability; United States; validation process; adult; Canada; classification; devices; Internet; middle aged; population health; procedures; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; self report; social discrimination; United States","Canada; Health status disparities; Intersectionality; Measurement; Racism; Scale development; Social discrimination; United States","","","Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (130489); Institute of Gender and Health, IGH, (MOP- 130489); Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Soc.

The goal is to highlight the evolution of the Inter-American jurisprudence on structural gender discrimination and to propose possible future developments. © 2020, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Our evidence comes from a correspondence test performed in France in which we use three different kinds of ethnic identification: French sounding names, North African sounding names, and “foreign” sounding names with no clear ethnic association. Within the groups of men and women, we show that all non-French applicants are equally discriminated against when compared to French applicants. Moreover, we find direct evidence of ethnic homophily: recruiters with European names are more likely to call back French named applicants. These results show the importance of favoritism for in-group members. To test for the effect of information about applicant’s skills, we also add a signal related to language ability in all resumes sent to half the job offers. The design allows to uniquely identify the effect of the language signal by gender. Although the signal inclusion significantly reduces the discrimination against non-French females, it is much weaker for male minorities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","Correspondence testing; Ethnic homophily; Gender discrimination; Language skills; Racial discrimination","","","Alexander S.

In this work, we address this annotation task via a novel subcategories-classification framework that not only performs word identification via the joint classifications of vowel and tone subcategories, but also performs gender discrimination of the speaker, which stands in contrast to previously proposed methods for Mandarin speech that focused only on tone-, vowel-, or gender- classification. We also propose a novel hierarchical classification algorithm to boost overall classification performance. Extensive experimental results show that our approach yielded superior performance in both cases of adequate and very limited training data. When trained using data from only one female and one male speaker, our approach also yielded the best classification accuracy in all subcategories of the token annotation problem, achieving an Fl-score of 0.742 as opposed to 0.705 as achieved by the second competing approach. © 2018 IEEE.","","Hierarchical classification; Label fusion; Monosyllabic Mandarin tokens; Multi-class SVMs; Phonetics","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2018","139797","Calgary","15 April 2018 through 20 April 2018","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Signal Processing Society","English","ICASSP IEEE Int Conf Acoust Speech Signal Process Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Thus, in this study involving a large Chinese cohort, we developed and validated a risk model for surgery-related AKI using preoperative risk factors. Methods and Findings: This retrospective cohort study included 24,451 hypertensive patients aged >18 years who underwent general surgery between 2007 and 2015. The endpoints for AKI classification utilized by the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) system were assessed. The most discriminative predictor was selected using Fisher scores and was subsequently used to construct a stepwise multivariate logistic regression model, whose performance was evaluated via comparisons with models used in other published works using the net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index. Results: Surgery-related AKI developed in 1994 hospitalized patients (8.2%). The predictors identified by our Xiang-ya Model were age, gender, eGFR, NLR, pulmonary infection, prothrombin time, thrombin time, hemoglobin, uric acid, serum potassium, serum albumin, total cholesterol, and aspartate amino transferase. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the validation set and cross validation set were 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.89) and (0.89; 95% CI 0.88-0.90), respectively, and was therefore similar to the AUC for the training set (0.89; 95% CI 0.88-0.90). The optimal cutoff value was 0.09. Our model outperformed that developed by Kate et al., which exhibited an NRI of 31.38% (95% CI 25.7%-37.1%) and an IDI of 8% (95% CI 5.52%-10.50%) for patients who underwent cardiac surgery (n = 2101). Conclusions/Significance: We developed an AKI risk model based on preoperative risk factors and biomarkers that demonstrated good performance when predicting events in a large cohort of hypertensive patients who underwent general surgery. © 2016 Liu et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Acute Kidney Injury; Adult; Aged; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Treatment Outcome; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; cholesterol; enhanced green fluorescent protein; hemoglobin; potassium; uric acid; biological marker; acute kidney failure; adult; age distribution; albumin blood level; area under the curve; Article; Chinese; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease classification; female; general surgery; heart surgery; hospital patient; human; hypertension; Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes; lung infection; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; potassium blood level; prediction; preoperative evaluation; prothrombin time; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; scoring system; sex difference; surgical risk; thrombin time; validation study; Acute Kidney Injury; adverse effects; aged; blood; complication; hypertension; Postoperative Complications; risk factor; treatment outcome","","","aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; cholesterol, 57-88-5; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; uric acid, 69-93-2; Biomarkers, ","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Following the experiment of McGurk and Macdonald (1976), the purpose of this study is to find out whether incongruent cues in audiovisual speech perception can alter the identification of the auditory stimulus, and to analyze whether this bimodal integration process causes a perceptual result other than the one that occurs in each channel separately. These results will allow us to know the extent to which the visual signal affects this class of stimuli and conditions, and determine, on the other hand, if the findings reflect differences in sensibilities in regards to the visual channel depending upon the speaker’s gender. For this purpose, 28 subjects (12 men and 16 women) had to identify the five vowels of Spanish distributed at random into three blocks: A) 25 audiovisual cross combinations between all vowels (thus in congruent and incongruent audiovisual conditions); b) 10 visual stimuli distributed in two series (5 x 2); and c) 5 auditory stimuli. Along with this, the participants had to indicate the degree of confidence of their response. Results showed, among other findings, that the presence in this kind of incongruent visual stimuli affects the perception of the auditory signal and results in perceptual fusions. It also demonstrates that visual information alone is not sufficient for discrimination, although important differences can be found depending on the presence of visual cues, such as rounding or vowel openness. There are also significant differences in visual perception and the variability of responses between men and women. © 2016 Universitat de Barcelona 1.

Design: Population-based cohort study, using a record-linkage analysis of prescription databases, hospital discharge records, and the civil registry. The predictive model was developed based on prescription patterns indicative of chronic diseases, using a random sample of 50% of the population. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess weights of different prescription patterns and drug classes. The predictive properties of the DDCI were confirmed in the validation cohort, represented by the other half of the population. The performance of DDCI was compared to the CCI in terms of calibration, discrimination and reclassification. Setting: 6 local health authorities with 2.0 million citizens aged 40 years or above. Results: One year and overall mortality rates, unplanned hospitalization rates and hospital readmission rates progressively increased with increasing DDCI score. In the overall population, the model including age, gender and DDCI showed a high performance. DDCI predicted 1-year mortality, overall mortality and unplanned hospitalization with an accuracy of 0.851,0.835, and 0.584, respectively. If compared to CCI, DDCI showed discrimination and reclassification properties very similar to the CCI, and improved prediction when used in combination with the CCI. Conclusions and Relevance: DDCI is a reliable prognostic index, able to stratify the entire population into homogeneous risk groups. DDCI can represent an useful tool for risk-adjustment, policy planning, and the identification of patients needing a focused approach in everyday practice. © 2016 Robusto et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Drug Prescriptions; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Italy; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Mortality; Patient Readmission; Population Surveillance; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Risk Factors; adult; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic disease; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; Drug Derived Complexity Index; female; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; Italy; male; measurement accuracy; middle aged; mortality; mortality rate; population risk; prediction; prescription; retrospective study; risk assessment; scoring system; unplanned hospitalization; validation study; aged; comorbidity; factual database; health survey; incidence; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; prescription; proportional hazards model; register; risk factor; statistical model","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Commission, EC, (2013 12 04)","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We examined task switching between two properties of faces, emotion and gender, for individuals drawn from Western (White UK citizens) and Asian (Pakistani) cultures. There were three main results of interest. First, there was a double dissociation between gender and emotion classification across the participant populations - Western participants were faster to make gender than emotion classifications while Asian participants were faster to make emotion than gender classifications. It is argued that the different patterns of results reflect the greater attentional weight given to contrasting face dimensions in the different cultures, and the dependence on using different attributes to make gender discriminations in individuals from varying cultures. Second, Asian participants showed smaller switch costs overall than did White British participants. This result may be attributed to effects of bilingualism in the Asian participants, which results in their having greater executive resources. Third, emotion decisions showed larger switch costs than gender decisions but essentially because emotion decisions benefited from priming on non-switch trials. It is argued that emotion decisions benefit from the activation of a specific processing module across consecutive trials. © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd with the Asian Association of Social Psychology and the Japanese Group Dynamics Association.","","Cognition; Culture; Emotion; Face categorization; Task switching","","","","","","","","","","English","Asian J.

Signals were recorded during eyes-closed resting state from 30 EEG channels. Six frequency bands were analysed: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), gamma (30-45 Hz) and total (1-45 Hz) frequency band. Coherence for estimation of functional connectivity and three graph theory measures, clustering coefficient (C), characteristic path length (L) and small-worldness (S), were calculated. Feature selection was conducted with two algorithms: genetic algorithm (GA) and sequential feature selection (SFS). Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross-validation was used for classification. Repeated cross-validation test and McNemar's test were used to compare classification accuracies. The results of the study indicate that adding graph theoretical measures to functional connectivity does not significantly increase classification accuracy for distinguishing MDD and healthy subjects.

Many state-of-the-art gender recognition approaches based on a variety of biometrics, such as face, body shape, voice, are proposed recently. Among them, relying on voice is suboptimal due to significant variations in pitch, emotion, and noise in real-world speech. Inspired from the speaker recognition approaches relying on i-vector presentation in NIST SRE, it's believed that i-vector contains information about gender as a part of speaker's characters, and works for speaker recognition as well as for gender recognition in complex environments. So, we apply the total variability space analysis to gender classification and propose i-vector based discrimination for speaker gender recognition. The results of experiments on TIMIT corpus and NUST603-2014 database show that the proposed i-vector based speaker gender recognition improves the performance up to 99.9%, and surpasses the pitch method and UBM-SVM baseline subsystems in term of accuracy comparatively. © 2015 IEEE.","Continuous speech recognition; Social sciences; Speech processing; Vector spaces; Vectors; Complex environments; Gender classification; Gender recognition; I vectors; Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients; Speaker recognition; State of the art; Total variability spaces; Speech recognition","gender recognition; i-vector; mel frequency cepstrum coefficient; speech processing","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IAEAC 2015","119925","Chongqing","19 December 2015 through 20 December 2015","Chongqing Global Union Academy of Science and Technology; Global Union Academy of Science and Technology; IEEE Beijing Section","English","Proc.

Although female sterilization is more dangerous, more expensive, and less effective than male sterilization, the Sterilization Gap incentivizes women to be sterilized rather than men. This Note argues that sterilization coverage should be extended to men. Because courts are empowered to extend underinclusive laws—like that which creates the Sterilization Gap—if they find them unconstitutional, litigation may be the best method of extending coverage. This Note presents a comprehensive argument for why the Sterilization Gap is unconstitutional and coverage should be extended. First, it argues that the Sterilization Gap is a facial sex classification because both sexes can be sterilized, even though the procedure is sex specific. Next, it argues that the classification violates constitutional equal protection law, because it is not based on a biological difference and does not remedy discrimination against women. Then, it argues that the classification was created either through impermissible oversight or gender stereotypes, and that it will perpetuate the stereotype that contraception is a woman’s responsibility, to the detriment of both sexes. Finally, it concludes by asserting that had Congress known that the Sterilization Gap was unconstitutional, it would likely have chosen to extend coverage to men rather than nullify the law, because extension would further its goals while causing comparatively little disruption to the statutory scheme. © 2015 by Gabriel Ascher.","","","","","","New York University Law Review","","","","","","English","New York Univ.

In this paper, we investigate how to build discrimination-aware models even when the available training set is intrinsically discriminating based on the sensitive attributes. We propose a new classification method called Discrimination-Aware Association Rule classifier (DAAR), which integrates a new discrimination-aware measure and an association rule mining algorithm. We evaluate the performance of DAAR on three real datasets from different domains and compare DAAR with two non-discrimination-aware classifiers (a standard association rule classification algorithm and the state-of-the-art association rule algorithm SPARCCC), and also with a recently proposed discrimination-aware decision tree method. Our comprehensive evaluation is based on three measures: predictive accuracy, discrimination score and inclusion score. The results show that DAAR is able to effectively filter out the discriminatory rules and decrease the discrimination severity on all datasets with insignificant impact on the predictive accuracy. We also find that DAAR generates a small set of rules that are easy to understand and applied by users, to help them make discrimination-free decisions. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017.","Association rules; Big data; Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Filtration; Trees (mathematics); Association rule algorithm; Classification algorithm; Classification methods; Comprehensive evaluation; Decision tree method; Predictive accuracy; Rule mining algorithms; Sensitive attribute; Data mining","Association rule classification; Discrimination-aware data mining; Unbiased decision making","","","","Springer Verlag","17th International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery, DaWaK 2015","195959","Valencia","1 September 2015 through 4 September 2015","","English","Lect.

It is therefore hard to acquire a deeper understanding of model behavior and in particular how different features influence the model prediction. This is important when interpreting the behavior of complex models or asserting that certain problematic attributes (such as race or gender) are not unduly influencing decisions. In this paper, we present a technique for auditing black-box models, which lets us study the extent to which existing models take advantage of particular features in the data set, without knowing how the models work. Our work focuses on the problem of indirect influence: how some features might indirectly influence outcomes via other, related features. As a result, we can find attribute influences even in cases where, upon further direct examination of the model, the attribute is not referred to by the model at all. Our approach does not require the black-box model to be retrained. This is important if, for example, the model is only accessible via an API, and contrasts our work with other methods that investigate feature influence such as feature selection. We present experimental evidence for the effectiveness of our procedure using a variety of publicly available data sets and models. We also validate our procedure using techniques from interpretable learning and feature selection, as well as against other black-box auditing procedures. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we use it to audit a black-box recidivism prediction algorithm. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Data mining; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Algorithmic accountability; Black boxes; Direct examinations; Experimental evidence; Feature influence; Modeling behavior; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Predictive analytics","Algorithmic accountability; ANOVA; Black-box auditing; Deep learning; Discrimination-aware data mining; Feature influence; Interpretable machine learning","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1307801, 1633387, CNS-1302688, DMR-1307801, IIS-1251049, IIS-1513651, IIS-1633387, IIS-1633724)","Springer London","","","","","","English","Knowl.

To determine how the social categories of gender, class, race, and nationality operate in Caribbean immigrant women’s experience of being college students, focus groups were conducted with 27 English-speaking Caribbean-born women attending NYC undergraduate colleges. Data show when women move to the US they come from gendered cultural traditions that determined their social roles in the Caribbean. For most women, these rules continue to operate in the US. However, gender roles and traditions are not homogenous throughout the Caribbean, hence, there is variation in how they play out in women’s experiences in the US. Further, the formerly distinct boundaries between some Caribbean traditions and US traditions are being challenged. These findings underline the complex influence of intersecting identities in women’s roles and call attention to how they affect social identification in the context of college pursuits and other aspects of their lives. In light of increased cross-cultural contact and globalization these findings provide a better understanding of factors affecting the psychological adjustment of Caribbean immigrant women in the US and have implications for enhancing their adaptation across changing social contexts. © 2017, Sociedad Interamericana de Psicologia.

The current research expands on these findings by examining the effects of masculinity threats on attitudes about social inequality regarding women and gay men. Across studies, we predicted that men whose masculinity was threatened (compared to non-threatening controls) would be more accepting of social inequities that disadvantage women and gay men. Three hundred forty-four male students at a large northeastern U.S. university were randomly assigned to either (a) take a test about gender knowledge (Study 1 and 2) or (b) proofread either a gender knowledge test or university knowledge test (Study 2). Feedback on the test was altered to either threaten or assure masculinity. Following the test or proofreading task, men indicated their discomfort, anger (Study 2 only), and acceptance of discrimination and group-based inequality in society. In both studies identification with gender was measured as a potential moderator. The results of Study 1 (N = 160) showed that the masculinity manipulation only affected denial of discrimination against gay men, but this effect seemed to be related to the salience of gender rather than threatened masculinity. Study 2 (N = 184) added a gender salience comparison for clarification and replicated the results of Study 1, indicating that masculinity threats and assurances have effects independent of gender salience. In Study 1, men who were threatened and highly identified with their gender accepted more group-based inequality. The practical and social implications of these findings are discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","","Discrimination; Gender identity; Gender roles; Masculinity; Prejudice; Social inequality","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1152147)","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In that sense, equal protection relies on identity as a proxy, standing in to signify the types of discrimination we find most troubling. Equal protection’s current use of identity as proxy leads to a number of problems, including difficulties in defining identity categories; the tendency to privilege a dominant-identity narrative; failure to distinguish among the experiences of subgroups within larger identity categories; and psychological and emotional harm that can result from being forced to identify in a particular way to lay claim to legal protection. Moreover, because the Court’s identity-as-proxy jurisprudence relies on superficial notions of identity to fulfill a substantive commitment to equality, it is susceptible to co-option by majority groups. This Essay aims to engage readers in a thought experiment, to envision what equal protection doctrine might look like if it were structured to reflect the values identity is intended to serve without explicitly invoking identity categories as a way to delineate permissible and impermissible forms of discrimination. In doing so, it aims to incorporate directly into equal protection jurisprudence the notion that identities like race and gender are not merely a collection of individual traits, but the product of structural forces that create and maintain subordination. Under the “value-based” approach proposed herein, the primary concern of equal protection is not to eliminate differential treatment, but instead to deconstruct status hierarchies. Therefore, rather than applying heightened scrutiny to government actions based on race or gender, it applies heightened scrutiny to government actions that have the effect of perpetuating or exacerbating a history of discrimination or that frustrate access to the political process. The clearest impact of such a model would be in the context of affirmative action, where a majority plaintiff could no longer simply claim discrimination on the basis of race. Yet, the potential of a value-based model extends to other contexts as well—for example, challenges to voter identification laws, in which political exclusion would displace discriminatory intent and disparate impact as the relevant measure for analysis; and the treatment of pregnant women, in which discrimination on the basis of pregnancy would no longer have to align with gender to receive heightened scrutiny. This shift has several advantages: It allows the law to make important distinctions between groups and within groups; it alleviates the need for comparative treatment and solutions that favor taking from all over giving to some; it is less likely to generate identity-based harms; it is fact-driven rather than identity-driven and thus better suited to the judicial function; and it serves an important rhetorical function by changing the nature of rights discourse. © 2015, Columbia Law Review Association.

The statistical analyses employed are: mean; standard deviation; median and variance. Time domain and frequency domain features were extracted which are employed through classification of the EMG signals. The different hand movements studied were flexion and extension of the elbow and the wrist, pronation and supination of forearm and opening and closing of the hand. From this study, we concluded that the male subjects have higher values for all the four parameters than females and also the age group between 18 years to 40 years show higher values for the statistical parameters measured when compared with aged controls and modified mean frequency showed a highest recognition rate of 84.25% which can be used further for the designing of the prosthetic hand. © 2016 IEEE.","Biomedical signal processing; Disabled persons; Feature extraction; Frequency domain analysis; Human computer interaction; Muscle; Robotics; Comparative studies; Frequency domains; Human computer interfaces; Muscle activities; Rehabilitation robotics; Standard deviation; Statistical comparisons; Statistical parameters; Signal processing","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks, SPIN 2016","123774","Noida","11 February 2016 through 12 February 2016","","English","Int.

Methods: Fundamental frequency (F0) and the first two formant frequencies (F1 and F2) of voice samples produced by 25 male and 26 female Cantonese-speaking prepubertal children produced under two speaking conditions: (1) natural condition, and (2) imitation condition when mimicking the opposite gender voice were examined. Results: Accuracy of gender identification by adult listeners for voices associated with the natural and imitation conditions was 81.7% and 59.5% respectively. In addition to the lack of difference in F0 between genders under the natural condition, F1 and F2 associated with boys were lower than those with girls, suggesting differences in vocal tract length and possible sex-specific articulatory behaviors between boys and girls, in an attempt to enhance sexual dimorphism for gender voice identification. Under the imitation condition, boys exhibited significantly higher F0 and F1 than girls.

There are the various negative social perceptions related to mining of data, out of which many are potential discrimination and potential privacy invasion. The potential discrimination consists of unfairly treating and identifying people based on their existence and belonging to a particular group. Data mining and automated data collection techniques such as classification and association rule mining have provided way to taking decisions automatically, such as computation of insurance premium, loan granting or denial, credit card issue etc. If the provided data sets for training are biased in discriminatory (sensitive) attributes such as, race, gender, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions can be taken and may ensue. For avoiding this situations, antidiscrimination methodology like discrimination prevention and discovery have been considered in the data mining. There are mainly two types of discrimination, one is direct discrimination and second is indirect discrimination. Direct discrimination exists in the situations when decisions are taken on the basis of the sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination exists in the situations when decisions are taken on the basis of the non-sensitive attributes that are strongly correlated with the biased sensitive attributes. © 2016 The Authors.","Classification (of information); Correlation methods; Data privacy; Insurance; Virtual reality; Antidiscrimination; Automated data collection; Discrimination; Insurance premiums; Privacy invasions; Privacy preservation; Sensitive attribute; Social perception; Data mining","Antidiscrimination; correlation; Discrimination","","","","Elsevier B.V.","7th International Conference on Communication, Computing and Virtualization, ICCCV 2016","121160","Mumbai","26 February 2016 through 27 February 2016","","English","Procedia Comput.

The model assumes that female workers' productivity is noisier and that the noise/signal ratio tapers off more rapidly for male workers. These two assumptions yield numerous theoretical predictions pertaining to gender wage gaps. These predictions are tested using data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. As predicted, we find that men and women have the same wage at the start of their career, but that female wages grow at a slower rate thus generating a gender wage gap.

Additionally, the wide spread availability of ORAs, including their placement in disadvantaged neighborhoods, make them an especially promising venue through which to promote PA. The purpose of this study was to examine the combination of individual-level factors associated with ORA use in a socioeconomically diverse Southeastern US county. A 2011 random digit-dial survey included 829 adults aged 18+ years with complete data; questions assessed PA level and use/perceived safety of ORAs. Signal detection analysis, a non-parametric recursive partitioning technique, identified cutpoints for defining subgroups of respondents based on ORA use. Seven subgroups were defined ranging from 77.2 % ORA use (younger, met PA recommendations) to 31.8 % ORA use (older, perceived ORAs to be less safe). Signal detection did not identify gender or race as important for defining subgroups. Results suggest that gendered and ethnically-focused ORA promotion campaigns might be unnecessary. Instead, efforts could focus on increasing awareness of ORA facilities among older, less active adults. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Environment Design; Exercise; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Recreation; Signal Detection, Psychological; South Carolina; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; environmental planning; exercise; female; forecasting; human; interview; male; middle aged; perceptive discrimination; qualitative research; recreation; South Carolina; very elderly; young adult","Outdoor recreation area; Parks; Physical activity; Signal detection; Survey research","","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","","","English","J.

Using a unique data set drawn from observers’ assessments of photos posted by White, Black, Latino, and multiracial online daters, this study examines how phenotype and observer characteristics influence racial categorization and cases of divergence between self-identities and others’ classifications. I find that despite the growth in the multiracial population, observers tend to place individuals into monoracial categories, including Latino. Skin color is the primary marker used to categorize others by race, with light skin associated with Whiteness, medium skin with Latinidad, and, most strongly, dark skin with Blackness. Among daters who self-identify as Black along with other racial categories, those with dark skin are overwhelmingly placed solely into a Black category. These findings hold across observers, but the proportion of photos placed into different racial categories differs by observers’ gender and race. Thus, estimates of inequality may vary depending not only on how race is assessed but also on who classifiers are. I argue that patterns of racial categorization reveal how the U.S. racial structure has moved beyond binary divisions into a system in which Latinos are seen as a racial group in-between Blacks and Whites, and a dark-skin rule defines Blacks’ racial options. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.","Black person; Caucasian; classification; classifier; female; gender; Hispanic; human; human experiment; identity; male; multiracial person; phenotype; race; shade; skin color; skin culture","Latinos; phenotype; race; racial classification; self-identification","","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Am.

Nonetheless, finding MRI relationships posses a challenge when analyzing in voxel-based highdimensional spaces. We introduce a kernel-based representation approach to support MRI discrimination. In this sense, inherent Inter-Slice Kernel (ISK) relationship is employed to highlight brain structure distributions. Then, a generalized Euclidean metric is estimated by using a kernel-based centered alignment algorithm to code the correlation between MRI dependencies and prior demographic patient information. The proposed approach is tested on MRI data classification by considering patient gender and age categories. Attained results show how proposed methodology improves data interpretability and separability in comparison to state of the art algorithms based on MRI Voxelwise features. Therefore, introduced kernel-based representation can be useful to support MRI clustering and similarity inference tasks that are required on template-based image segmentation and atlas construction. © 2014 IEEE.","Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance; Alignment algorithms; Atlas construction; Data classification; Euclidean metrics; High dimensional spaces; Pathological process; Patient information; State-of-the-art algorithms; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd IEEE International Work-Conference on Bioinspired Intelligence, IWOBI 2014","110553","Liberia","16 July 2014 through 18 July 2014","et al.; IEEE Costa Rica Section; Instituto Tecnologico de Costa Rica (TEC); Universidad de Costa Rica; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad Nacional (UNA)","English","Int.

However, various theories predict that gender bias is more likely to manifest when there is greater uncertainty or when decision-makers' choices are under greater scrutiny from others. Such conditions characterized the lending market in the recent economic downturn. This article draws on an analysis of panel data from the Kauffman Firm Survey to investigate how the Great Recession affected the gender gap in entrepreneurial access to financing, net of individual and firm-level characteristics. Consistent with predictions, we find that women-led firms were significantly more likely than men-led firms to encounter difficulty in acquiring funding when small-business lending contracted in 2009 and 2010. We assess the consistency of our results with two different theories of bias or discrimination. Our findings shed light on mechanisms that may contribute to disadvantages for women entrepreneurs and, more broadly, highlight how the effects of ascribed status characteristics (e.g., gender) on economic decision-making may vary systematically with macroeconomic conditions. © 2016 The Author(s).","","Discrimination; Entrepreneurship; Gender; Recession; Status","","","","Society for Sociological Science","","","","","","English","Sociol.

Typically algorithms used to build decision models remain as a black-box to the end user. Therefore the process of decision making appears to be opaque. At the same time, increasing the transparency of a black-box decision making model allows us to discover hidden discrimination, and hold entities accountable. Although algorithmic transparency with respect to black box classifiers requires addressing many challenges, our main objective in this paper is to investigate whether a black-box classification model is biased against certain subgroups. Specifically, we study the indirect discrimination of hidden protected features. Protected features, such as race, gender, and religious beliefs, are those that are prohibited to be legally used for making decisions. Simply removing the protected features is not enough to eliminate discrimination because there could be strong correlations between protected features and non-protected features, such as race versus zip code. In this paper, we present two techniques to measure discrimination of a black-box model as a result of data bias or algorithmic weakness. Data bias is investigated further by introducing artificial bias to the dataset under consideration. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our bias measures where bias comes from different sources. © 2016 IEEE.","Decision making; Learning systems; Transparency; Black-box model; Classification models; Credit cards; Decision making models; Decision models; Discrimination; Making decision; Strong correlation; Data mining","Data mining; Discrimination; Machine learning","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2nd IEEE International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing, IEEE CIC 2016","125951","Pittsburgh","1 November 2016 through 3 November 2016","Drexel University; RMIT; University of Pittsburgh; University Zhejiang University","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In a separate line of research, Riemannian manifolds have been shown useful for dealing with features and models that do not lie in Euclidean spaces. With the aim of building a bridge between the two realms, we address the problem of sparse coding and dictionary learning in Grassmann manifolds, i.e., the space of linear subspaces. To this end, we propose to embed Grassmann manifolds into the space of symmetric matrices by an isometric mapping. This in turn enables us to extend two sparse coding schemes to Grassmann manifolds. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for learning a Grassmann dictionary, atom by atom. Lastly, to handle non-linearity in data, we extend the proposed Grassmann sparse coding and dictionary learning algorithms through embedding into higher dimensional Hilbert spaces. Experiments on several classification tasks (gender recognition, gesture classification, scene analysis, face recognition, action recognition and dynamic texture classification) show that the proposed approaches achieve considerable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods such as kernelized Affine Hull Method and graph-embedding Grassmann discriminant analysis. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Codes (symbols); Discriminant analysis; Face recognition; Geometry; Dictionary learning; Dictionary learning algorithms; Discrimination accuracy; Dynamic texture classifications; Grassmann manifold; Riemannian geometry; Sparse coding; State-of-the-art methods; Learning algorithms","Dictionary learning; Grassmann manifolds; Riemannian geometry; Sparse coding","","","Australian Research Council; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP130104567, F120100969); Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy , Australian Government, DBCDE","Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","","","English","Int J Comput Vision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In four experiments (n = 797), women and men made considerably stronger discrimination attributions, and were moderately more discouraged from seeking work, when the victim was female rather than male. Further, a series of regressions analyses showed beliefs in discrimination of women to be moderately correlated with discrimination attributions of female victims, but little added explanatory value of participant gender, stigma consciousness, or feminist identification.

Also, to limit these areas with a high accuracy ratio and to feedback to the user of this system were the other objectives. This integration was performed with using energy mapping, analysis methods and multiple image processing methods and the system which was consisted from these advanced algorithms was appeared. For this work, in the range of 25–40 years and when gender discrimination was insignificant, 30 volunteer patients were chosen. During the formation of the system, to exalt the accuracy to the maximum level, 2 main stages were followed up. First, in the system, advanced image processing methods were processed between each other and obtained data were studied. Second, in the system, FFT and Log transformations were used respectively for the first two cases, then these transformations were used together for the third case. For totally three cases, energy distribution and DC energy intensity analysis were done and the performance of this system was investigated.

A secondary aim was to demonstrate a useful statistic approach for such investigations (Partial Least Squares Regression; PLSR), which is underutilized in this field. Fortyfive participants (70 - 164 months; Mage = 110.89; 34 male) were recruited from a large neuropsychological assessment clinic. Participants completed subtests from the NEPSY-II focusing on neuropsychological constructs that have been linked to social functioning (affect decoding, social memory, motor skills, visuomotor skills, response inhibition, attention and set-shifting, and verbal comprehension). Mothers completed the BASC-2, from which Atypicality and Social Skills scales were analyzed. PLSR revealed that difficulty with social memory, sensorimotor integration, and the ability to attend to and accurately discriminate auditory stimuli combine to best predict atypical or ""odd"" behavior. In terms of social skills, two factors emerged. The first factor indicated that, counterintuitively, greater emotional perception, visuospatial perception, ability to attend to and accurately discriminate auditory stimuli, and understand instructions was related to poorer social skills. The second factor indicated that a pattern of better facial memory, and sensorimotor ability (execution & integration) characterized a distinct profile of greater social ability. PLSR results were compared to traditional OLS and Backwards Stepwise regression approaches to demonstrate utility. Results also suggested that these findings were consistent across age, gender, and diagnostic group, indicating common neuropsychological substrates of social functioning in this sample of referred youth. Overall, this study provides the first characterization of optimized combinations of neuropsychological variables in predicting social functioning in assessment clinic-referred youth, and introduces to this literature a valuable statistical approach for obtaining such characterizations. © 2015 Lerner et al.","Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Learning Disorders; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Referral and Consultation; adolescent; affect; Article; attention; auditory discrimination; auditory stimulation; backward stepwise regression; Behavior Assessment System for Children Second Edition; child; clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depth perception; Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment Second Edition; emotion; female; groups by age; human; intermethod comparison; juvenile; male; memory; mother; motor performance; neuropsychological test; ordinary least square; partial least squares regression; patient referral; process optimization; psychological rating scale; sensorimotor function; sensorimotor integration; sex difference; social adaptation; social interaction; statistical analysis; stimulus response; visuomotor coordination; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Learning Disorders; patient referral; psychology","","","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The aim of this study was to investigate peroxiredoxin 4 (Prx4), a proposed novel biomarker of oxidative stress, and its association with and capability as a biomarker in predicting (cardiovascular) mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Prx4 was assessed in baseline serum samples of 1161 type 2 diabetes patients. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the relationschip between Prx4 and (cardiovascular) mortality. Risk prediction capabilities of Prx4 for (cardiovascular) mortality were assessed with Harrell's C statistic, the integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement. Results: Mean age was 67 and the median diabetes duration was 4.0 years. After a median follow-up period of 5.8 years, 327 patients died; 137 cardiovascular deaths. Prx4 was associated with (cardiovascular) mortality. The Cox proportional hazard models added the variables: Prx4 (model 1); age and gender (model 2), and BMI, creatinine, smoking, diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol-HDL ratio, history of macrovascular complications, and albuminuria (model 3). Hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) for cardiovascular mortality were 1.93 (1.57 - 2.38), 1.75 (1.39 - 2.20), and 1.63 (1.28 - 2.09) for models 1, 2 and 3, respectively. HR for all-cause mortality were 1.73 (1.50 - 1.99), 1.50 (1.29 - 1.75), and 1.44 (1.23 - 1.67) for models 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Addition of Prx4 to the traditional risk factors slightly improved risk prediction of (cardiovascular) mortality. Conclusions: Prx4 is independently associated with (cardiovascular) mortality in type 2 diabetes patients. After addition of Prx4 to the traditional risk factors, there was a slightly improvement in risk prediction of (cardiovascular) mortality in this patient group. © 2014 Gerrits et al.","Aged; Biological Markers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Oxidative Stress; Peroxiredoxins; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; cholesterol; creatinine; high density lipoprotein; peroxiredoxin 4; biological marker; peroxiredoxin; age; aged; albuminuria; article; body mass; cardiovascular mortality; disease duration; enzyme blood level; female; follow up; gender; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oxidative stress; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; systolic blood pressure; vascular disease; blood; cardiovascular disease; epidemiology; middle aged; Netherlands; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; proportional hazards model","","","cholesterol, 57-88-5; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; peroxiredoxin, 207137-51-7; Biological Markers, ; Peroxiredoxins, ","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

For example, women's beliefs about their vulnerability to aggression are associated with a stronger preference for physical formidability and aggressive dominance in male bodies and faces. In the current study, we extend these previous findings by testing whether dangerous world beliefs predict accuracy in processing facial cues associated with affiliation or deception. In addition, we include a sample of men to determine if these effects generalize to both genders. In the present study, participants viewed a series of images of a target displaying both Duchenne (genuine) and non-Duchenne (posed) smiles and were asked to categorize them as real or fake; participants also completed the Belief in a Dangerous World scale. Results revealed that for women, greater dangerous world beliefs predicted greater accuracy in discriminating real and fake smiles; no relationship was observed between dangerous world beliefs and smile detection accuracy for men. These findings uniquely demonstrate that dangerous world beliefs predict greater accuracy in adaptive face perception; however, this relationship seems to be specific to women. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","","Affiliation; Duchenne smiles; Face perception; Interpersonal threat","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Chinese esophageal cancer patients have demonstrated six high-risk candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus, the present study aimed to determine the risk of these SNPs predisposing to lung cancer in Chinese population. Methods: A total of 1170 lung cancer patients and 1530 normal subjects were enrolled in this study from high-incidence areas for esophageal cancer in Henan, northern China. Five milliliters of blood were collected from all subjects for genotyping. Genotyping of 20 high-risk SNP loci identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on esophageal, lung and gastric cancers was performed using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Polymorphisms were examined for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using X2 test. Bonferroni correction was performed to correct the statistical significance of 20 SNPs with the risk of lung cancer. The Pearson's X2 test was used to compare the distributions of gender, TNM stage, histopathological type, smoking and family history by lung susceptibility genotypes. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the associations between genetic variants and overall survival. Results: Four of the 20 SNPs identified as high-risk SNPs in Chinese esophageal cancer showed increased risk for Chinese lung cancer, which included rs3769823 (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.107-1.509; P = 0.02), rs10931936 (OR = 1.283; 95% CI = 1.100-1.495; P = 0.04), rs2244438 (OR = 1.294; 95% CI = 1.098-1.525; P = 0.04) and rs13016963 (OR = 1.268; 95% CI = 1.089-1.447; P = 0.04). All these SNPs were located at 2q33 region harboring-genes of CASP8, ALS2CR12 and TRAK2. However, none of these susceptibility SNPs was observed to be significantly associated with gender, TNM stage, histopathological type, smoking, family history and overall survival. Conclusions: The present study identified four high-risk SNPs at 2q33 locus for Chinese lung cancer and demonstrated the shared susceptibility loci at 2q33 region for Chinese lung and esophageal cancers. © 2017 Zhao et al.

This study examined a model of Asian American activism that included a context-specific variable, model minority beliefs, and 3 traditional predictors of collective engagement: experiences of discrimination, collective racial identity, and structural awareness. Method: Participants completed a survey on their sociopolitical attitudes and behaviors. All participants identified as Asian American (N = 187; Mage = 32.99) and were generally well-educated (76.8% had a college degree or higher), politically liberal (68.5%), and female (74.2%). Results: Controlling for gender, age, political orientation, and immigrant generation, the results of the serial mediation model revealed that structural awareness, collective racial identity, and model minority beliefs significantly mediated the relationship between discrimination and own-group activism. Results also showed that model minority beliefs negatively predicted own-group activism. Conclusions: In addition to replicating broad findings from the collective action literature among Asian Americans, this research highlights the importance of contextualized group-based beliefs about inequality (model minority beliefs) for understanding engagement among racial minority groups. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Adult; Asian Americans; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Minority Groups; Social Identification; Social Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Asian American; awareness; behavior; college; controlled study; female; gender; human; identity; immigrant; major clinical study; male; minority group; PsycINFO; statistical model; adult; Asian American; gender identity; minority group; perception; psychology; questionnaire; social behavior; university","Asian Americans; Collective action; Collective racial identity; Model minority myth; Own-group activism","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Cult.

Of particular interest is examining the ways in which the visibility of gender discrimination and the invisibility of ethnic discrimination indicate what the professionals in the study identify as horizons of possible individual and collective resistance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes as its point of departure Cho et al. (2013) notion of ""intersectionality as an analytical sensibility"" (p. 795). The material consists of qualitative semi-structured interviews with 15 chief medical doctors employed in two Swedish hospitals. Findings: The findings indicate that while there is an organisational visibility of gender inequality, there is an organisational invisibility of ethnic discrimination. These differences influence the ways in which organisational criticism takes place and inequalities are challenged. Female Swedish identified doctors acted collectively to challenge organisations that they considered male-dominated, while doctors with experience of migration (both female and male) placed more responsibility on themselves and established individual strategies such as working more or des-identification. However, they confronted the organisation by naming ethnic discrimination in a context of organisational silence. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not explore the different forms of racism (islamophobia, racism against blacks, anti-Semitism). In addition, further research is needed to understand how these various forms of racism shape workplaces in Sweden. Originality/value: The paper offers new insights into the difference/similarities between how processes of ethnic and gender discrimination are experienced among employees within high-status professions. The value of the paper lies in its special focus on how forms of resistance are affected by the frames of the organisation. The findings stress the importance of intersectional analyses to understand the complex patterns of resistance and consent emerging within organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","","Gender and ethnic discrimination; Health care organizations; Intersectionality; Resistance; Sweden","","","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","English","Equal.

We developed gender-specific indices to measure risk of HIV among sexually active individuals in Rakai, Uganda. Methods: We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate time-to-HIV infection associated with candidate predictors. Reduced models were determined using backward selection procedures with Akaike's information criterion (AIC) as the stopping rule. Model discrimination was determined using Harrell's concordance index (c index). Model calibration was determined graphically. Nomograms were used to present the final prediction models. Results: We used samples of 7,497 women and 5,783 men. 342 new infections occurred among females (incidence 1.11/100 person years,) and 225 among the males (incidence 1.00/100 person years). The final model for men included age, education, circumcision status, number of sexual partners, genital ulcer disease symptoms, alcohol use before sex, partner in high risk employment, community type, being unaware of a partner's HIV status and community HIV prevalence. The Model's optimism-corrected c index was 69.1 percent (95% CI = 0.66, 0.73). The final women's model included age, marital status, education, number of sex partners, new sex partner, alcohol consumption by self or partner before sex, concurrent sexual partners, being employed in a high-risk occupation, having genital ulcer disease symptoms, community HIV prevalence, and perceiving oneself or partner to be exposed to HIV. The models optimism-corrected c index was 0.67 (95% CI = 0.64, 0.70). Both models were well calibrated. Conclusion: These indices were discriminative and well calibrated. This provides proof-of-concept that population-based HIV risk indices can be developed. Further research to validate these indices for other populations is needed.","Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Status Indicators; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior; Uganda; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; alcohol consumption; article; circumcision; community; concurrent sexual partnership; education; female; genital ulcer; high risk population; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence; incidence; infection risk; major clinical study; male; marriage; occupation; sexual behavior; Uganda; cohort analysis; health status indicator; HIV Infections; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; middle aged; risk factor; sex difference; statistics and numerical data; young adult","","","","National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (U01AI075115, ZIAAI001040); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD050180)","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Method: To test the reliability and validity of this new measure, we surveyed 575 Asian American emerging adults (49% female, 79% U.S. born). Results: Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, the results show 7 reliable subscales: maintenance of heritage culture, becoming American, awareness of discrimination, avoidance of other groups, minimization of race, promotion of equality, and cultural pluralism. Tests of factorial invariance show that overall, the subscales demonstrate, at minimum, partial metric invariance across gender, age, nativity, educational attainment, parent educational attainment, geographic region of residence, and Asian-heritage region. Thus, the relations among the subscales with other variables can be compared across these different subgroups. The subscales also correlated with ethnic identity, ethnic centrality, perceptions of discrimination, and pluralistic orientation, demonstrating construct validity.

However, psychosocial determinants of this risk, including everyday discrimination, and potential moderators of such effects remain unexplored. Objective: We examined the influence of discrimination, a culturally relevant stressor, on odds of gaining weight beyond Institute of Medicine recommendations during pregnancy. Whether the effect was moderated by race/ethnicity, age, or depressive symptoms was also examined. Method: Participants were 413 Black and Latina pregnant young women, ages 14-21 years. Experience with discrimination and all moderators were assessed in the second trimester. Last weight recorded in the third trimester was abstracted from medical records and used to determine excessive weight gain. Results: Ever experiencing discrimination was associated with a 71% increase in the odds of excessive weight gain. The effect of discrimination was primarily present among women who attributed this treatment to membership in a historically oppressed group (e.g., ethnic minority, female) or to membership in other stigmatized groups (e.g., overweight). The effect of ever experiencing discrimination was not moderated by race/ethnicity or age but was moderated by depressive symptoms. Supporting the perspective of the environmental affordances model, discrimination strongly predicted excessive weight gain when women were low in depressive symptoms but had no effect when women were high in depressive symptoms. The moderating role of depressive symptoms was equivalent for Black and Latina women. Conclusion: Results highlight the role of discrimination in perpetuating weight-related health disparities and suggest opportunities for improving health outcomes among young pregnant women. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Adolescent; African Americans; Depression; Female; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Overweight; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Prejudice; Risk Factors; Weight Gain; Young Adult; black population; ethnicity; gender disparity; Latino people; mental health; obesity; pregnancy; racism; young population; adolescent; adult; age distribution; Article; clinical feature; controlled study; depression; disease association; ethnicity; female; human; obesity; outcome assessment; prediction; pregnancy; second trimester pregnancy; social attitude; social discrimination; social interaction; social stigma; third trimester pregnancy; young adult; African American; ethnology; health disparity; Hispanic; obesity; pregnancy; prejudice; psychology; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; weight gain","Adolescents; Black; Discrimination; Latina; Pregnancy; Weight gain; Young women","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH074394, R01MH074399, T32MH020031)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Soc.

Analyses reveal no support for the proposition that membership in racial, sexual, and ethnic minority groups significantly reduces women’s gendered political consciousness. In addition, women who perceive high levels of racial, ethnic, or sexuality-based discrimination are more likely than other women to hold a strong political consciousness of gender.

Based on reported associations of TRPA1 genetics with increased sensitivity to thermal pain stimuli, we therefore hypothesized that this association also exists for increased olfactory sensitivity. Methods: Olfactory function and nociception was compared between carriers (n = 38) and non-carriers (n = 43) of TRPA1 variant rs11988795 G>A, a variant known to enhance cold pain perception. Olfactory function was quantified by assessing the odor threshold, odor discrimination and odor identification, and by applying 200-ms pulses of H2S intranasal. Nociception was assessed by measuring pain thresholds to experimental nociceptive stimuli (blunt pressure, electrical stimuli, cold and heat stimuli, and 200-ms intranasal pulses of CO2). Results: Among the 11 subjects with moderate hyposmia, carriers of the minor A allele (n = 2) were underrepresented (34 carriers among the 70 normosmic subjects; p = 0.049). Moreover, carriers of the A allele discriminated odors significantly better than non-carriers (13.1±1.5 versus 12.3±1.6 correct discriminations) and indicated a higher intensity of the H2S stimuli (29.2±13.2 versus 21±12.8 mm VAS, p = 0.006), which, however, could not be excluded to have involved a trigeminal component during stimulation. Finally, the increased sensitivity to thermal pain could be reproduced. Conclusions: The findings are in line with a previous association of a human TRPA1 variant with nociceptive parameters and extend the association to the perception of odorants. However, this addresses mainly those stimulants that involve a trigeminal component whereas a pure olfactory effect may remain disputable. Nevertheless, findings suggest that future TRPA1 modulating drugs may modify the perception of odorants. © 2014 Schütz et al.","Adult; Calcium Channels; Female; Humans; Male; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Nociception; Pain; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Semantics; Smell; Transient Receptor Potential Channels; Young Adult; transient receptor potential channel A1; calcium channel; nerve protein; transient receptor potential channel; TRPA1 protein, human; adult; allele; article; clinical article; cold sensitivity; controlled study; electrostimulation; female; gender; gene; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; heat sensitivity; human; hyposmia; male; nociception; olfactory discrimination; pain threshold; smelling; thermal stimulus test; TRPA1 gene; clinical trial; genetics; odor; pain; phenotype; semantics; single nucleotide polymorphism; young adult","","","Calcium Channels, ; Nerve Tissue Proteins, ; Transient Receptor Potential Channels, ; TRPA1 protein, human, ","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The notion of comparable worth has been promoted for several years by the ILO and a few countries to fight against relatively lower female salaries. The purpose of this paper is to review the rationales for comparable worth and explain how gender biases, generally involved in traditional job evaluation, can be prevented. Design/methodology/approach - To do this, after reviewing the motives, logics and three major applications of comparable worth logics in pay equity policies, the authors expose an analysis of a French sectorial job classification that the authors carried out as experts for establishing a French Equality Ombudsman's guide. Findings - The findings show how the redundancy and definition of job evaluation criteria, along with the weighting system, contributes to undervaluation of clerks jobs, predominantly held by women. The authors also highlight the main recommendations of the guide to prevent gender bias in job evaluation, that are derived from this case study, among others. The authors conclude on the difficulties of implementing comparable worth in France, in a period of long lasting economic crisis and of weak union power. Research limitations/implications - The paper is based on a single case study, conducted for policy actors. It was not conducted at first for academic research purposes, and may thus have some methodological limitations. The implications of the research are, however, important at academic level - highlighting the persistence of gender bias - and at policy level, as it provides recommendations for negotiators. Practical implications - The guide originally aimed at giving guidelines and ""good practices"" in order to prevent gender discrimination in job evaluation. Social implications - The paper draws attention to the importance and difficulty of undergoing such classification changes in times of economic crisis. Stronger legal action seems necessary. Originality/value - This experience is the first of its kind - promoted by the Ombudsman - in France.

We analyze data from the Asian subsample (n = 2,095) of the National Latino and Asian American Study. The data show that noncitizens report greater psychological distress compared with naturalized citizens and native-born citizens after accounting for sociodemographics (e.g., age, gender, Asian subgroup), socioeconomic characteristics (education, employment, income-to-poverty ratio), immigration (e.g., interview language, years in the United States, acculturative stress), health care visits, and everyday discrimination.

Speaker discrimination consists in the automatic distinction between two speakers using the vocal characteristics of their speeches. A number of features are extracted using Mel Frequency Spectral Coefficients and then reduced using Relative Speaker Characteristic (RSC) along with the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Several classification methods are implemented to ensure the discrimination task. Since different classifiers are employed, two fusion algorithms at the decision level, referred to as Weighted Fusion and Fuzzy Fusion, are proposed to boost the classification performances. These algorithms are based on the weighting of the different classifiers outputs. Furthermore, the effects of speaker gender and feature reduction on the speaker discrimination task have been examined too. The evaluation of our approaches was conducted on a subset of Hub-4 Broadcast-News. The experimental results have shown that the speaker discrimination accuracy is improved by 5–15% using the (RSC–PCA) feature reduction. In addition, the proposed fusion methods recorded an improvement of about 10% compared to the individual scores of the classifiers.

In addition to comorbid disease conditions (Dx), prescription drugs (Rx) are important risk factors for dementia. Objective: Develop and validate the RxDx-Dementia risk index by combining diagnosis and prescription information in a single risk index to predict incident dementia, and compare its performance with diagnosis-based Charlson comorbidity score (CCS) and prescription-based chronic disease score (CDS). Methods: Elderly patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and without prior dementia were identified from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2003-2012). A Cox proportional hazard model was constructed to model the time to dementia by incorporating age, gender, and 31 RxDx disease conditions as independent variables. Points were assigned to risk factors to obtain summary risk score. Discrimination and calibration of the risk index were evaluated. Different risk indices were compared against RxDx-Dementia risk index using c-statistic, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results: Of 133,176 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, 3.42% patients developed dementia. The c-statistics value for RxDx-Dementia risk index was 0.806 (95% CI, 0.799-0.812). Based on the c-statistics, NRI and IDI values, the RxDx-Dementia risk index performed better compared to CCS, CDS, and their combinations. Conclusion: The RxDx-Dementia risk index can be a useful tool to identify hypertensive and diabetic patients who are at high risk of developing dementia. This has implications for clinical management of patients with multiple comorbid conditions as well as risk adjustment for database studies. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prescription Drugs; Proportional Hazards Models; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; prescription drug; prescription drug; age; aged; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic disease score; comorbidity; dementia; dementia assessment; gender; human; hypertension; major clinical study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prescription; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; RxDx Dementia Risk Index; validation process; cohort analysis; complication; dementia; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; female; hypertension; male; middle aged; predictive value; proportional hazards model; reproducibility; risk assessment; very elderly","Dementia; hypertension; prediction model; risk index; Type 2 diabetes","","Prescription Drugs, ","","IOS Press","","","","","","English","J.

This history provides a backdrop to the diversity of present-day acculturation orientations, which are influenced by factors such as generation status, length of residence in the USA, religion, and discrimination. The chapter reviews the mental health correlates of these acculturation orientations, as well as protective factors such as family, ethnic identity, and religiosity that have been found to promote resilience and reduce acculturative stress. Unique acculturation experiences are discussed for youth, women, and the elderly. In addition to identifying gaps in the literature, the chapter offers a critique of Arab American acculturation research to date, including limitations in conceptualizations and methodologies.

In particular the focus is on gender and cultural producers. In almost all the subsections of the cultural industries, from the audio-visual industry through to digital design, women are underrepresented in the most prestigious and creative roles (see for example Gill 2002). In the main women are consigned to lower paid roles and struggle to access roles with prestige and respect attached to them. This is certainly the case in the United Kingdom, as many sector and university research projects have emphasised (Skillset1 2010a, Richards and Milestone 2000, Haines 2004). These trends are found elsewhere such as in the USA (Christopherson 2008) and Australia (Akuma and Barnes 2009). There are other intersectional inequalities in terms of access to the cultural industries that are based on ethnicity, class, sexuality and disability. However, for the purpose of this chapter we keep our focus solely on gender. It is uncomfortable to confront the statistics that point to cultural industries as places where ‘the typical creative industry workforce is white, male, young and highly qualified’ (Skillset 2010b). Neo-liberal and post-feminist discourses allege that we have moved away from dichotomies of what constitute ‘men’s work’ and ‘women’s work’. To get hung up on old classifications is deemed outmoded and irrelevant in a new meritocratic world where the individual is responsible for their own success or failure. On the face of it there should be no reason why cultural industries are not composed of a diverse workforce. Cultural industries tend to be located in cities and are frequently connected with popular, rather than high culture. Richard Florida (2002) champions creative cities as bohemian places that thrive on diversity and difference. But, as Gill has noted, although media representations of cultural industries tend to emphasise the presence of a diverse workforce, research findings repeatedly reveal that this is not the case. Let us explore how to account for this troubling situation. In 1975 Laura Mulvey wrote a highly influential article that highlighted the gender and power dichotomies at play in the film industry. Using Hitchcock films as a case study, Mulvey highlighted the problematic impact of the male domination of film director roles. As most films are produced from the standpoint of the ‘male gaze’, when women feature in films their role is predominantly ‘to be looked at’. Women are passive, decorative and powerless because they are excluded from key cultural production roles (notably in film direction). As Judith Williamson (1978) also noted, this gendered power relationship is also overwhelmingly pervasive in the realm of advertising. A glance at contemporary media products reveals that little has changed in terms of how women are represented in the media. Indeed many argue that the situation is now far worse than in the 1970s. Concerns have recently been raised in reports such as the 2010 report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on the Sexualisation of Girls and UK Government Home Office commissioned research (Papadopoulos 2010) on the same subject. The media doesn’t encourage girls and women to imagine themselves in charge of the means of cultural production. Instead women continue to be bombarded with messages and images that infer that a woman’s role is to conform to the regulations of the ‘male gaze’. It is undeniably depressing that we seem to have a tidal wave of ‘retrosexism’ (Whelehan 2000) dominate the output of the cultural industries. However if we take the view that these ascribed roles (of men as creators and women as malleable, voiceless objects) are cultural constructions then the possibility of change is present. Judith Butler (1990) argues that all gendered behaviour is a performance. It is the work of ideology to render what is learned, socially constructed behaviour as natural and therefore unchangeable. Taking a cue from Butler’s ideas let’s consider this idea of gender and performance with an example from the cultural industries. In a recently unearthed BBC documentary from 19672, Mick Jagger describes how, in this period, British audiences of live performances given by The Rolling Stones were overwhelmingly female, whilst in continental Europe the opposite was the case. Importantly here Jagger observed that the male fans in Europe behaved in ways typically associated with female fans. This response to pop music in its infancy appears yet to have been constrained by ideals about masculine and feminine fan behaviour (Sandvoss 2005). There had already been high-profile circulation of images of ‘spectacular’ female fandom in response to acts such as Elvis and The Beatles. But, in some parts of Europe at least, some young men felt that a highly emotional expression of fandom was available to them. This example supports claims that masculinity is a cultural construct as gender identities can manifest themselves in variable ways depending on context. The case of these young music fans provides an example of why gendered behaviour should not be regarded as being fixed and ŉatural’. Having briefly highlighted some key research about gender and popular culture, let us now examine gender in a contemporary case study from the cultural industries workplace. The case study is of new media businesses in Manchester (United Kingdom) and serves as an illustrative case study of gendered inequalities and creative labour. Cultural industries that are centred on new media or digital technologies are considered to be increasingly important to both the UK and Manchester economy (Künster et al. 2013). Evidence from labour market research and academic research projects have both highlighted that new media businesses are particularly problematic sub-sectors of the creative industries in terms of providing employment opportunities for women (Skillset 2010a, Gill 2002, Perrons 2003, Tams 2002, Banks and Milestone 2011). Data from interviews with owner-managers and key decision makers in 20 small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the field of web design, interactive gaming, digital marketing and advertising are discussed. This research explores cultural industries workplace cultures at close range to consider why women are finding it difficult to gain recognition and reward for their cultural work. We provide some contextual information before looking at the research findings in detail. The promotion of the creative industries in the UK context was accompanied by a sense of optimism in the early years of the New Labour government’s term of office. Cultural industries (as they were initially termed in the Greater London Council’s (GLC) influential cultural industries policies) were seen as offering employment possibilities that could tap into the creativity and enthusiasm of diverse groups of young people (O’Connor 2007, Mulgan and Worpole 1986). The GLC project prioritised the promotion of diversity as a key criterion for funding. There was an optimism that unlike the hierarchical business models and elite ‘old boy networks’ of the old economy, the creative sector could offer an attractive new alternative to groups who had previously been marginalised from the workplace. There was optimism about the apparent low barriers to entry and the modest start-up costs made possible by the falling price of new creative technologies. As Kate Oakley observes, ‘[t]raditions of popular culture from music to videogames, the strength of subcultural identity, the informal skills associated with creativity and in some cases the low capital entry that digital technology opened up, all combined to suggest that the growth of a “creative economy” was one in which everyone could play’ (2007: 262). Oakley concurs that this inclusivity has yet to materialise. Contemporaneously to the development of cultural/creative industries was the emergence of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the internet. This had a profound impact and spawned a plethora of novel career options in areas such as web design, internet marketing, interactive gaming and digital music production - to name but a few. As Kennedy notes, the new economy - and new media work in particular - was a sphere that was frequently held up as being particularly progressive for women (2009: 179). However when researchers began to investigate these new businesses an unpalatable pattern began to emerge that contradicted the arguments about the openness of this industry and the diverse make-up of the workforce (Richards and Milestone 2000, Ursell 2000, Gill 2002). The creative industries are also not as accessible to those from working class backgrounds as had been assumed (Oakley 2007, Allen and Holligworth 2013). In addition to class barriers, research also points to the exclusion of ethnic minorities from creative industries (Bose 2005, Tatli and Özbilgin 2012). Whilst it would be highly valuable to examine intersecting inequalities there is not space to do this now. Disappointingly, 30 years after the GLC project and with a far more developed creative industries landscape, there remain some uncomfortable questions about why these new, ‘informal’, anti-hierarchical businesses that rely on ‘light’ technology and creativity have not delivered a diverse workforce. As Adkins argues, there is a ‘deep rooted exclusion of women from these reflexivized occupations’ (1999: 126). The creative industries have emerged concurrently with a ‘post feminist’ (Aronson 2003, McRobbie 2004) landscape where feminism is represented as outmoded and unnecessary, and the rise of neo-liberalism (Prasad 2006), where equal opportunities policies are held to be excessively bureaucratic. Recent research about student placements in creative industries reiterates earlier arguments made in the work of Gill (2002) and McRobbie (2002) and reveals that a lack of acknowledgement of the inequalities dominates because of an assumed meritocracy; ‘privilege and disadvantage is reproduced by the gatekeepers in the sector through unspoken assumptions and resistance to acknowledge discrimination’ (Tatli and Özbilgin 2012: 259). Within the sector its workers and advocates do not routinely acknowledge that creative industries are difficult for many people to access. The products of the cultural industries often exacerbate, reinforce and solidify cultural expectations about the type of person that is ŉaturally’ suited to working in the new media sector. There has been little evidence of culture change across the creative sector and this inhibits the career development of women. This trend is clearly not unique to Manchester. A recent Skillset census, the largest gender-specific research on the creative industries in England, concludes that there is ‘widespread under-representation across the board and enormous variance between sectors and occupations in levels of employment of women’ (2010a: 2). The authors note that women are most heavily represented in sectors with large employers who are able to offer more stable and long-term employment prospects (television, radio and book publishing are cited as the largest employers of women). Their research recorded a massive drop of women in interactive content design (dropping from 32 per cent to 5 per cent from 2006 to 2009). © 2015 Kate Oakley and Justin O’Connor for selection and editorial matter; individual contributions the contributors.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","The Routledge Companion to the Cultural Industries","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

This study aims to develop a mortality risk score based on previously identified risk predictors and to perform internal and external validations. Methods In a population-based prospective cohort study of 611 community-dwelling individuals aged 65+ in St. Petersburg (Russia), all-cause mortality risks over 2.5 years follow-up were determined based on the results obtained from anthropometry, medical history, physical performance tests, spirometry and laboratory tests. C-statistic, risk reclassification analysis, integrated discrimination improvement analysis, decision curves analysis, internal validation and external validation were performed. Results Older adults were at higher risk for mortality [HR (95%CI) = 4.54 (3.73–5.52)] when two or more of the following components were present: poor physical performance, low muscle mass, poor lung function, and anemia. If anemia was combined with high C-reactive protein (CRP) and high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was added the HR (95%CI) was slightly higher (5.81 (4.73–7.14)) even after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Our models were validated in an external population of adults 80+.

However, dominance in terms of ethnicity, gender or other aspects of diversity has been resistant to change in many sectors. The different factors which contribute to low diversity are often hotly contested and difficult to untangle. We propose that many of the barriers to change arise from self-reinforcing feedbacks between low group diversity and inclusivity. Using a dynamic model, we demonstrate how bias in employee appointment and departure can trap organizations in a state with much lower diversity than the applicant pool: A workforce diversity ""poverty trap"". Our results also illustrate that if turnover rate is low, employee diversity takes a very long time to change, even in the absence of any bias. The predicted rate of change in workforce composition depends on the rate at which employees enter and leave the organization, and on three measures of inclusion: Applicant diversity, appointment bias and departure bias. Quantifying these three inclusion measures is the basis of a new, practical framework to identify barriers and opportunities to increasing workforce diversity. Because we used a systems approach to investigate underlying feedback mechanisms rather than context-specific causes of low workforce diversity, our results are applicable across a wide range of settings. © 2015 O'Brien et al.","Cultural Diversity; Feedback, Psychological; Humans; Models, Psychological; Models, Theoretical; Social Justice; Workplace; Article; employee attitude; employment discrimination; employment status; ethnicity; human; mathematical model; personnel management; prediction; work; work environment; workforce diversity; workplace; adaptive behavior; cultural diversity; psychological model; social justice; theoretical model; workplace","","","","UQ Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Information Technology Special Studies Program","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

First, the authors investigated predictions about mediation effects of ethnic socialization and marianismo in the association between perceived discrimination and coping strategies. Second, they tested predictions about mediation effects of coping strategies in the link between perceived discrimination and mental health outcomes. Results of path analyses showed that perceived discrimination was positively related to familismo and spiritual marianismo pillars, preparation for bias, and engagement coping strategies. Furthermore, the link between perceived discrimination and engagement coping strategies was partially mediated via preparation for bias. Finally, perceived discrimination, disengagement coping strategies and self-silencing marianismo attitudes were negatively linked to mental health. Overall, these findings highlight the complex ways in which coping strategies are linked with one's ethnic and gender socialization and related to perceived discrimination and mental health outcomes.","","coping strategies; Latina college students; marianismo; perceived discrimination; racial-ethnic socialization","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","J.

A total of 283 subjects comprising 147 males and 136 females age range 18–25 years participated. Photographs methods were used to capture the face. Independent sample t-test was used to test for sex differences in the variables. Binary logistic regression was applied to obtain a predicting equation (BLR model) for sex. The predicted probabilities of BLR were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that all the facial linear dimensions showed significance sexual dimorphism except interocular distance, upper facial width, philtrum length, lower vermilion width, left and right orbital width. With regards to sex prediction, upper facial height was the single best predictor of sex with an accuracy of 76.2% and 24–33% contribution to the prediction. However, the percentage accuracy increased to 91% when six variables were pooled together in the equations. For facial angles, only nasion and aperture modified angle did not show significant gender differences. However, in the variables with significant sexual dimorphism only nasomental angle showed a significant level of sex prediction with an accuracy of 70.3%. In conclusion, sex discrimination using facial linear dimensions and angles was well established in this study. The sex of an individual of Hausa ethnic group can be determined using facial linear dimensions. Dispite sexual dimorphsm shown by facial angles, only nasomental angle was good discriminator of sex. © 2016 The International Association of Law and Forensic Sciences (IALFS)","","Facial angles; Facial dimensions; Forensic anthropology population data; Hausas of Nigeria; Sex prediction","","","","Egyptian Forensic Medicine Authority","","","","","","English","Egypt.

This article argues that this turn to materiality may further embed gender discrimination. We draw on Luce Irigaray’s work to highlight the dangers inherent in masculine discourses of materiality. We discuss Irigaray’s identification of how language and discourse elevate the masculine over the feminine so as to offer insights into ways of changing organizational language and discourses so that more beneficial, ethically-founded identities, relationships and practices can emerge. We thus stress a political intent that aims to liberate women and men from phallogocentrism. We finally take forward Irigaray’s ideas to develop a feminist écriture of/for organization studies that points towards ways of writing from the body. The article thus not only discusses how inequalities may be embedded within the material turn, but it also provides a strategy that enriches the possibilities of overcoming them from within. © The Author(s) 2014.","","embodiment; feminism; feminist écriture; gender fluidity; Irigaray; materiality","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","Hum.

We perform extensive robustness checks to mitigate concerns about potential threats to identification posed by measurement error and unobservables. Our evidence indicates that women who do not feel treated with respect and dignity have a higher incentive to migrate abroad. The likelihood that these migration intentions are turned into actual preparations, however, depends on more traditional determinants such as household income, network effects and family obligations. Furthermore, we also show that more intense gender imbalances in economic and political opportunities prevent women from actually moving abroad. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","gender disparity; gender identity; household income; migration determinant; womens status","Female migration; Gender discrimination; Migration intentions; Selection model","","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","J.

Using a miRNA microarray, we previously showed that the whole blood level of let-7e-5p was significantly higher in ischemic stroke patients than in control subjects. However, the association between let-7e-5p expression and the occurrence of ischemic stroke remains unknown. In this study, we validated the expression levels of let-7e-5p in two case-control populations using miRNA TaqMan assays and further investigated the potential targets of let-7e-5p. The results suggest that the blood level of let-7e-5p was significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke than in controls (p<0.05). Higher levels of let-7e-5p were associated with increased occurrence of ischemic stroke (adjusted OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.61∼2.21, p<0.001) in the combined population. The addition of let-7e-5p to traditional risk factors led to animprovement in the area under the curve, which increased from 0.74 (95% CI, 0.70∼0.78) to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78∼0.85), with a net reclassification improvement of 16.76% (p<0.0001) and an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.10 (p<0.0001) for patients with ischemic stroke. Bioinformatics prediction and cell experiments suggested that the expression levels of four genes enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway were down-regulated by let-7e-5p transfection. Specifically, the expression levels of the genes CASP3 and NLK were significantly lower in ischemic stroke patients than in controls and were negatively correlated with let-7e-5p expression. In summary, our study suggests the potential use of blood let-7e-5p as a biomarker for ischemic stroke and indicates its involvement in the related pathomechanism.

Exploring how and why particular pathways in dyslexia theory, research and practice were historically pursued, whilst other potentially successful methods were not, Montgomery argues that gender bias has played a significant and often obstructive role in the development of our identification and understanding of dyslexia. Explaining why women and girls have often been under-represented in dyslexia clinics and in research, chapters trace the contributions made by dyslexia pioneers, analyse current problems within education and research systems, and document widespread patterns of misogyny and gender discrimination in the field. Montgomery links dyslexia history, current research paradigms and transgender experiences, to ask whether assumed male superiority has disadvantaged dyslexic learners, and whether it will continue to do so. In the process, she presents a new trajectory for research and practice. A timely exploration of the impacts of gender discrimination on research and education, this text provides essential insight into the subtle impacts of sexism on dyslexic learners. © 2019 Diane Montgomery.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","Dyslexia and Gend.

The human skull is a useful tool for identities in natural disasters and criminal investigations. Aim: Using stepwise Fisher and logistic regression to build multivariate linear discriminant function to achieve sex determination for Uighur adult skull of Turpan, Xinjiang. Methods: Using CT equipment to acquire and reconstruct 267 (114 males and 153 females) three-dimensional skull models. Sixteen measurement indicators were measured and computed. Stepwise Fisher and logistic regression was performed to build the sex discriminant function and leave-one-out cross validation was used to evaluate accuracy. Results: Average of fifteen measurement indicators of male was bigger than that of female. Only one measurement indicator of male was smaller than female. Except two indicators (X7 and X13), the other existed significant difference (p < 0.01). According to sex discriminant function consisting of four indicators (X1, X4, X10, X11), using stepwise Fisher method, the accuracy of male was 86.8% and female was 86.2%. According to sex discriminant function consisting of five indicators (X4, X6, X12, X15, X16), using Logistic method, the accuracy of male was 89.4% and female was 90.2%. According to sex discriminant function consisting of incomplete skull with only frontal and mandibular, using stepwise Fisher method, the accuracy of male was 67.9% and female was 69.1%. Using Logistic method, the accuracy of male was 68.7% and female was 70.4%. Conclusion: By combining computer software with machine learning classification algorithm, the sex discrimination of complete skull and incomplete skull can be realized. In the gender identification of the Uygur population, the Logistic regression method is better than the stepwise Fisher method. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Biometrics; Disasters; Discriminant analysis; Forensic engineering; Learning systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; Forensic anthropologies; Logistic regressions; Measurement indicators; Sex determination; Skull models; Stepwise fisher; Regression analysis","3D skull model; Forensic anthropology; Logistic regression; Measurement indicators; Sex determination; Stepwise fisher","","","Graduate Scientific Research Foundation of Northwest University; Shaanxi Province International Cooperation Project, (2013KW04-04); Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Basic Research Project, (2018JM6061); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61363065); Northwest University, NWU, (YZZ17181); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, (2014JM8358); Shaanxi Provincial Science and Technology Department, (2010JQ8011)","Springer Verlag","13th Chinese Conference on Biometric Recognition, CCBR 2018","216949","Urumchi","11 August 2018 through 12 August 2018","","English","Lect.

This study investigates the association between ethnic-identity search, ethnic-identity affirmation, perceived discrimination, and unidirectional (victimization only, perpetration only) and bidirectional (reciprocal violence) IPV behaviors among foreign-born and U.S.- born Hispanic young adults. Method: Data are from Project RED (Reteniendo y Entendiendo Diversidad para Salud), a study investigating the effect of psychosocial and sociocultural factors on health behavior among a community sample of Hispanic young adults in Southern California (n = 1,267). Results: Approximately 40% of the sample reported unidirectional or bidirectional IPV, with significant gender differences across the three categories. Compared with men, women had approximately 70% lower odds of victimization (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.15-0.71), over twice the odds of perpetration (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.98 -3.62), and 35% higher odds (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.04 -1.81) of bidirectional IPV. Higher ethnic-identity affirmation was protective for victimization (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.81-0.99) and bidirectional IPV (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.62-0.89), whereas higher perceived discrimination scores increased the odds for bidirectional IPV (OR = 1.37 95% CI = 1.26 -1.56) and was particularly detrimental for foreign-born participants. Conclusion: Intervention strategies should consider genderspecific risk profiles, cultural contexts, and the influence of sociocultural stressors. Addressing the harmful effects of perceived discrimination and leveraging the protective effects of ethnic-identity affirmation may be promising IPV-prevention strategies for Hispanic young adults.

A simple Blinder-Oaxaca type decomposition analysis of the female-male inter-industry wage differential suffers mainly from identification problems. Therefore, we use a new approach to overcome these problems. Our results suggest that the female-male wage gap in the Turkish labor market is relatively high and in favor of males in human health activities, education activities, and financial service activities (except insurance and pension funding). Also, it is generally small among other industries. A possible explanation for this fact is that the female labor force participation rate is low in these sectors in Turkey. © 2015, Ahmet Yesevi University.

Our      aim was to develop and validate a prediction model for assessing the probability      of      advanced CRN using a clinical data warehouse. Methods: A total of 49,450 screenees      underwent      their first colonoscopy as part of a health check-up from 2002 to 2012      at Samsung      Medical Center, and the dataset was constructed by means of natural language      processing      from the computerized EMR system. The screenees were randomized into training      and      validation sets. The prediction model was developed using logistic regression.      The      model performance was validated and compared with existing models using area      under      receiver operating curve (AUC) analysis. Results: In the training set, age,      gender,      smoking duration, drinking frequency, and aspirin use were identified as      independent      predictors for advanced CRN (adjusted P < .01). The developed model      had good      discrimination (AUC = 0.726) and was internally validated (AUC = 0.713).      The      high-risk group had a 3.7-fold increased risk of advanced CRN compared to the      low-risk      group (1.1% vs. 4.0%, P < .001). The discrimination performance of the      present      model for high-risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the      Asia-Pacific      Colorectal Screening score (AUC = 0.678, P < .001) and Schroy’s CAN      index      (AUC = 0.672, P < .001). Conclusion: The present 5-item risk model can be calculated      readily      using a simple questionnaire and can identify the low- and high-risk groups      of      advanced CRN at the first screening colonoscopy. This model may increase colorectal      cancer      risk awareness and assist healthcare providers in encouraging the high-risk      group      to undergo a colonoscopy. © 2017 Hong et al.

However, little is known about the influence of religious and host national identification on this relationship. This study investigated the moderating role of ethnic, religious, and host national identification on the relationship between perceived discrimination and problem behaviors in Muslim immigrant early adolescents living in the Netherlands. Analyses revealed gender-specific moderating effects for ethnic and religious group identification. For boys, no moderating effects were found. For girls, strong religious group identification increased the relationship between perceived ethnic discrimination and problem behaviors, whereas a strong ethnic identification served a buffering role. No moderating effects were found for host national identification. The findings underline the importance of including different types of group identification in research on the relation between perceived discrimination and immigrant adolescent problem behaviors. © The Author(s) 2013.","","ethnic identification; internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors; national identification; perceived ethnic discrimination; religious identification","","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","J.

To achieve robustness, the proposed method first computes directional edge responses using eight Kirsch compass masks. Then, the spatial relationships among the neighboring pixels in each edge response are exploited independently with the help of local binary pattern (LBP) to enhance the discrimination capability. Finally, spatial histograms computed from these LBP images are concatenated to build a face descriptor. Our proposed descriptor efficiently extracts discriminating information from four different levels, including gradient, regional, global and directional level. The proposed method was evaluated on three datasets (color FERET, LFW, and Adience) containing facial photographs. In spite of a wide range of challenges (low resolution, variations in pose, expression, and illumination) present in the datasets, the proposed method provided promising classification performance in comparison with several existing benchmark methods, thereby validating its robustness. Moreover, this paper also investigates the gender recognition of facial sketches.

While face and irises have been extensively studied, the periocular region has emerged as a promising trait for unconstrained biometrics, following demands for increased robustness of face or iris systems. With a surprisingly high discrimination ability, this region can be easily obtained with existing setups for face and iris, and the requirement of user cooperation can be relaxed, thus facilitating the interaction with biometric systems. It is also available over a wide range of distances even when the iris texture cannot be reliably obtained (low resolution) or under partial face occlusion (close distances). Here, we review the state of the art in periocular biometrics research. A number of aspects are described, including: (i) existing databases, (ii) algorithms for periocular detection and/or segmentation, (iii) features employed for recognition, (iv) identification of the most discriminative regions of the periocular area, (v) comparison with iris and face modalities, (vi) soft-biometrics (gender/ethnicity classification), and (vii) impact of gender transformation and plastic surgery on the recognition accuracy.

Based on the analysis of social discourse, we have created a pool of items and undertaken three empirical studies aimed to develop and validate the Russian Attitudes to Homosexuals Inventory (RAHI) and investigate the associations of homophobic attitudes with a range of demographic and psychological variables. In Study 1 we used an online sample (N = 1,007) and explored the structure of the item pool, finding 8 factors, 5 of which referred to different dimensions of perceived threat of homosexuals (to individuals, morals, society, Russian culture, and heterosexual lifestyle) and 3 described social strategies directed at homosexuals (criminal punishment, medical treatment, and discrimination vs. protection). The scales were highly reliable (SOH = .82-.91) and formed a single second-order dimension, labelled general index of homophobia. Negative attitudes to homosexuals were stronger in males, religious respondents, and those heterosexuals who denied having experienced any feelings of same-sex attraction in their life. In Study 2 (paper-based sample, N = 292) we cross-validated the second-order structure of the RAHI. Using hierarchical multiple regression we found that homophobia was positively predicted by authoritarianism and negatively predicted by experience of same-sex attraction and social contact with homosexuals as friends. We also found weaker positive associations of homophobia with religiosity, social identification with gender, masculinity, extraversion, and social desirability, as well as a negative association with openness. In Study 3 we used contrast groups of neutral and anti-homosexual online community members (N = 330 and N = 107) to check the criterion validity of the RAHI. The findings are in line with the existing body of research from other countries, but reveal the culturally-specific features of the content of Russian homophobia (e.g., homosexuality is viewed as a result of Western influence). The RAHI emerged as a valid and reliable tool, which can be used for future Russian-language studies.","","Attitudes to homosexuality; Authoritarian personality; Homo-negativity; Homosexual prejudice; Perceived threat of homosexuals","","","","National Research University Higher School of Economics","","","","","","English","Psikhologiya","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Applications include automatic curricula evaluation, wage determination, and risk assessment for credits and loans. Recently, many governments and institutions have raised concerns about the lack of fairness, equity and ethics in machine learning to treat these problems. It has been shown that not including sensitive features that bias fairness, such as gender or race, is not enough to mitigate the discrimination when other related features are included. Instead, including fairness in the objective function has been shown to be more efficient. We present novel fair regression and dimensionality reduction methods built on a previously proposed fair classification framework. Both methods rely on using the Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion as the fairness term. Unlike previous approaches, this allows us to simplify the problem and to use multiple sensitive variables simultaneously. Replacing the linear formulation by kernel functions allows the methods to deal with nonlinear problems. For both linear and nonlinear formulations the solution reduces to solving simple matrix inversions or generalized eigenvalue problems. This simplifies the evaluation of the solutions for different trade-off values between the predictive error and fairness terms. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methods in toy examples, and evaluate their performance on real world datasets to predict income using gender and/or race discrimination as sensitive variables, and contraceptive method prediction under demographic and socio-economic sensitive descriptors. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Economic and social effects; Economics; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Function evaluation; Inference engines; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Dimensionality reduction; Equity; Fairness; Kernel methods; Regression; Learning algorithms","Dimensionality reduction; Equity; Fairness; Kernel methods; Machine learning; Regression","","","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (TIN2015-64210-R); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (TEC2016-77741-R)","Springer Verlag","European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML PKDD 2017","209269","Skopje","18 September 2017 through 22 September 2017","","English","Lect.

Method: The study is a mixed methods research, cross-sectional, exploratory study. The study was organized through two phases of data collection and analysis (QUAL → quan). Based on qualitative focus group discussions (FGD), we first gathered data through field notes. Later, we engaged in analysis using techniques drawn from qualitative data including categorization, theme identification, and connection to existing literature. Based on this analysis, we developed a questionnaire that could provide quantitative measures based on the qualitative FGD. We then administered the questionnaire, and the quantitative data were analyzed to quantitatively test the qualitative findings. Twenty-four faculty and 142 students from the 4th and 5th clinical years participated voluntarily. Their perception of FA and the cultural challenges that hinder its adoption were evaluated through a FGD and a questionnaire. Results: The mean score of understanding FA concept was equal in faculty and students (p=0.08). The general challenge that scored highest was the need to balance work and academic load in faculty and the need to balance study load and training and mental anxiety in students. There was no difference between faculty and students in perceiving ""learning is teacher-centered"" (p=0.481); and ""past learning and assessment experience"" (p=0.322). There was a significant difference between them regarding interaction with opposite gender (p<0.001). Students showed higher value as regards the ""gap between learning theories and assessment practice"", ""grade as a priority"", and ""discrimination by same faculty gender"".

Objective: This study aims to investigate the psychometric properties of the CAGE using both non-parametric and parametric IRT models, assess whether there is any differential item functioning (DIF) by age, gender and ethnicity and examine the measurement precision at the cut-off scores. Methods: We used data from the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly study to conduct Mokken scaling analysis (MSA), dichotomous Rasch and 2-parameter logistic IRT models. The measurement precision at the cut-off scores were evaluated using classification accuracy (CA) and classification consistency (CC). Results: The MSA showed the overall scalability H index was 0.459, indicating a medium performing instrument. All items were found to be homogenous, measuring the same construct and able to discriminate well between respondents with high levels of the construct and the ones with lower levels. The item discrimination ranged from 1.07 to 6.73 while the item difficulty ranged from 0.33 to 2.80. Significant DIF was found for 2-item across ethnic group. More than 90% (CC and CA ranged from 92.5% to 94.3%) of the respondents were consistently and accurately classified by the CAGE cut-off scores of 2 and 3. Conclusions: The current study provides new evidence on the validity of the CAGE from the IRT perspective. This study provides valuable information of each item in the assessment of the overall severity of alcohol problem and the precision of the cut-off scores in older adult population. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aged; Alcoholism; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Statistics, Nonparametric; aged; alcoholism; female; human; male; middle aged; nonparametric test; psychological model; psychological rating scale; psychometry; validation study","CAGE; differential item functioning; item response theory; Mokken scaling analysis; older adults; validity","","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd","","","","","","English","Subst.

Based on previous research, a classification of harmful workplace experiences affecting women is proposed and then used in the analysis of 88 studies with 93 independent samples, containing 73,877 working women. We compare the associations of different harmful workplace experiences and job stressors with women’s work attitudes and health. Random-effects meta-analysis and path analysis showed that more intense yet less frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention) and less intense but more frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexist organizational climate and gender harassment) had similar negative effects on women’s well-being. Harmful workplace experiences were independent from and as negative as job stressors in their impact on women’s occupational well-being. The power imbalance between the target and the perpetrator appeared as a potential factor to explain the type and impact of harmful workplace experiences affecting women’s occupational well-being. In the discussion, we identify several gaps in the literature, suggest directions for future research, and suggest organizational policy changes and interventions that could be effective at reducing the incidence of harmful workplace experiences.

The present research examined whether stereotypes also influence attributions to discrimination. Consistent with predictions, undergraduate participants who strongly vs. weakly endorsed gender stereotypes, either chronically (Study 1, N = 147) or when situationally primed (Study 2, N = 258), were less likely to attribute gender disparities in the workplace to discrimination. In addition, participants unexpectedly made stronger discrimination attributions when explaining gender gaps in leadership positions than in STEM occupations, suggesting that interventions for addressing gender discrimination may need to use different strategies for different contexts. Overall, results are consistent with the notion that stereotypes influence explanations for group disparities in ways that justify existing social arrangements as fair, just, and legitimate. Our findings have implications for understanding when people will acknowledge discrimination, which is an important first step toward addressing discrimination. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","controlled study; female; gender; human; leadership; major clinical study; male; occupation; prediction; sexism; stereotypy; workplace","Attribution; Division of labor; Sex discrimination; Sex role attitudes; Stereotyped attitudes","","","Psi Chi, ΨΧ","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, discrimination as a consequence of socio-economic disadvantage remains understudied. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of perceived discrimination on well-being, perceptions of safety and school integration amongst children growing up within socio-economically disadvantaged communities in Limerick, Ireland. Mediation analysis was used to explore these relationships and to examine the potential role of parental support and community identity in boys and girls in the 6th to 9th year of compulsory education (N = 199). Results indicate perceived discrimination contributed to negative outcomes in terms of school integration, perceptions of safety and levels of well-being. Age and gender differences were observed which disadvantaged boys and younger children. All negative outcomes were buffered by parental support. Community identity also protected young people in terms of feelings of school integration and risk but not in terms of psychological well-being. Findings are discussed in terms of the different role of family and community supports for children negotiating negative social representations of their community. © 2016 The British Psychological Society.","Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Female; Humans; Ireland; Male; Parent-Child Relations; Poverty; Prejudice; Quality of Life; Residence Characteristics; Sex Factors; Social Identification; Social Stigma; Social Support; Vulnerable Populations; adolescent; age; child; child parent relation; demography; female; human; Ireland; male; poverty; prejudice; psychology; quality of life; sex difference; social behavior; social stigma; social support; vulnerable population","Community identity; Perceived discrimination; Rejection-identification socio-economic disadvantage","","","Irish Research Council","John Wiley and Sons Ltd.","","","","","","English","Br.

Cook et al. found that feminine men were not more likely to be depressed despite the observation that they were more likely to be discriminated against and that discrimination increased the likelihood of depression. This is in contrast to what studies among gay and bisexual men in Western countries have consistently shown. In the current study, 196 Black South African MSM (ages between 18 and 40; M age, 26.65 years) were surveyed. Assessments included stressors (identity confusion, internalized homophobia, and sexual orientation-based discrimination) and resilience factors (openness about one’s sexual orientation, social support, and identification with the gay community). We observed that gender-nonconforming men were not more likely to be depressed despite having experienced more discrimination, which was associated with depression. The same relationships were observed when considering anxiety as the mental health outcome. We found an indirect negative effect of gender nonconformity on depression through internalized homophobia, suggesting that, in this population, internalized homophobia masks the effect of discrimination on mental distress. Implications for the sexual minority stress model, used to guide our analyses, are discussed. Further research is needed to disentangle the complex relationship between gender nonconformity and mental health among MSM populations. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Depression; Homophobia; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Self Concept; Social Conformity; Social Support; adult; aged; anxiety; depression; homophobia; human; male; male homosexuality; mental health; middle aged; minority group; psychology; self concept; social psychology; social support; statistics and numerical data","Discrimination; Gender nonconformity; Men who have sex with men; Mental health; Sexual orientation; South Africa","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (P30MH043520, R01MH083557); amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Arch.

Dysphonia is a disorder that alters vocal quality and can impair and reduce the quality of life. The structural or functional alteration of the phonatory apparatus, unhealthy lifestyles or an excessive use of the vocal cords for work activities (e.g. teaching) can cause voice disorders. Unfortunately, people who suffer from dysphonia often underestimate its symptoms and therefore delay consulting a speech therapist for accurate voice assessment and treatment. Voice disorder evaluation involves a series of tests, including an acoustic analysis. This quantifies the measurements of voice quality through the evaluation of certain characteristic parameters, for example the fundamental frequency (F0). In this paper, a personalized methodology for the estimation of the F0 is presented. The personalization is accomplished by taking into account two of the main factors that influence the F0, the gender and age of the subject. The estimation of the F0 is crucial for the classification of the voice signal, because the discrimination of a healthy voice from a pathological one is achieved by evaluating the inclusion of the F0 value within the healthy range. To evaluate the presented methodology, we have carried out a set of tests by using some voice signals selected from an available database in order to compare the classification ability of the proposed methodology with other algorithms existing in the literature. The numerical results obtained show that the proposed methodology provides a good accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively of over 77%, 72% and 81%, values better than those achieved by the most frequently other used and cited fundamental frequency estimation algorithms. Additionally, a statistical analysis to evaluate whether or not a statistically significant difference exists between the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity has been carried out. The outcome of the ANOVA tests and of the t-tests confirms that there is a significant difference between the proposed methodology and the other algorithms. Finally, the presented methodology could be embedded in a portable and simple m-health application that could be useful for the monitoring of the state of vocal health and the prevention of voice disorders. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Frequency estimation; mHealth; Natural frequencies; Signal processing; Acoustic analysis; Classification ability; Fundamental frequencies; Fundamental frequency estimation; Health systems; Sensitivity and specificity; Statistically significant difference; Voice disorders; acoustic analysis; adolescent; adult; algorithm; Article; classification; controlled study; dysphonia; female; frequency analysis; human; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; speech analysis; vocal cord; vocalization; voice analysis; voice change; voice disorder; Quality control","Fundamental frequency analysis; m-Health system; Signal processing; Voice disorders","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Biomed.

Consequently, the relative contributions of facial shape and surface characteristics to attractiveness and dominance perceptions are unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the relationships between ratings of original versions of faces and ratings of versions in which either surface information had been standardized (i.e., shape-only versions) or shape information had been standardized (i.e., surface-only versions). For attractiveness and dominance judgments of both male and female faces, ratings of shape-only and surface-only versions independently predicted ratings of the original versions of faces. The correlations between ratings of original and shape-only versions and between ratings of original and surface-only versions differed only in two instances. For male attractiveness, ratings of original versions were more strongly related to ratings of surface-only than shape-only versions, suggesting that surface information is particularly important for men's facial attractiveness. The opposite was true for female physical dominance, suggesting that shape information is particularly important for women's facial physical dominance. In summary, our results indicate that both facial shape and surface information contribute to judgments of others' attractiveness and dominance, suggesting that it may be important to consider both sources of information in research on these topics. © 2014 Torrance et al.","Adolescent; Adult; Face; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Social Dominance; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; classification; controlled study; decision making; dominance behavior; face profile; female; gender; human; human experiment; male; normal human; perception; physical attractiveness; physical parameters; prediction; standardization; visual discrimination; visual information; adolescent; anatomy and histology; face; facial expression; social dominance; vision; young adult","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, (ES/I031022/1); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (282655)","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, in sub adult skeletal remains whose osseous morphological traits of the sex have not defined yet, predicting sex on the basis of odontometric features may be the most precise technique. The aim of the present study was to assess the degree of sexual dimorphism in marginal enamel, dentin and pulp dimensions of second molar deciduous teeth in a pediatric population. Method and materials The present study was conducted on bitewing radiographs of 64 males and 60 females. The greatest width of enamel, dentin and pulp on mandibular and maxillary second molar deciduous teeth were measured. Student's t-test and discriminant analysis were used to compare the differences in the odontometric parameters between females and males. Results Among the second molar measurements, only the maxillary pulp width did significantly discriminate the sex groups. The accuracy of sex identification of a case based on deciduous second molar tooth was approximately 68%. Conclusions The application of second molar deciduous teeth in sex prediction showed moderate level of sexual dimorphism. In this respect, the maxillary pulp width had the greatest amount of contribution in sex discrimination. Therefore, these odontometric traits, in conjunction with other skeletal features, can be used as a supplementary sexing tool for gender prediction in forensic anthropology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine","Child; Child, Preschool; Dental Enamel; Dental Pulp; Dentin; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Forensic Dentistry; Humans; Male; Molar; Odontometry; Radiography, Bitewing; Sex Characteristics; Tooth, Deciduous; Article; child; dentin; discriminant analysis; enamel; female; forensic anthropology; human; male; mandible; maxilla; measurement precision; odontometry; pediatrics; primary dentition; radio odontometric analysis; sex difference; Student t test; tooth pulp; X ray film; deciduous tooth; dentistry; diagnostic imaging; molar tooth; preschool child; sexual development; tooth radiography","Deciduous teeth; Forensic science; Odontometrics; Sex prediction","","","International branch, (8793073); Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, SUMS","Churchill Livingstone","","","","","","English","J.

Methods: Thirteen deaf adults (age = 29.1±13.5 years; 8 male, 5 female) who had used CIs for >6 months and 10 normal-hearing (NH) adults participated in this study. Seven of them were prelingually deaf, and 6 postlingually deaf. The Mandarin Monosyllablic Word Recognition Test was used to assess recognition of words, phonemes and lexical tones in AV and AO conditions at 3 presentation levels: speech detection threshold (SDT), speech recognition threshold (SRT) and 10 dB SL (re:SRT). Results: The prelingual group had better phoneme recognition in the AV mode than in the AO mode at SDT and SRT (both p = 0.016), and so did the NH group at SDT (p = 0.004). Mode difference was not noted in the postlingual group. None of the groups had significantly different tone recognition in the 2 modes. The prelingual and postlingual groups had significantly better phoneme and tone recognition than the NH one at SDT in the AO mode (p = 0.016 and p = 0.002 for phonemes; p = 0.001 and p<0.001 for tones) but were outperformed by the NH group at 10 dB SL (re:SRT) in both modes (both p<0.001 for phonemes; p<0.001 and p = 0.002 for tones). The recognition scores had a significant correlation with group with age and sex controlled (p<0.001). Conclusions: Visual input may help prelingually deaf implantees to recognize phonemes but may not augment Mandarin tone recognition. The effect of presentation level seems minimal on CI users' AV perception. This indicates special considerations in developing audiological assessment protocols and rehabilitation strategies for implantees who speak tonal languages. © 2014 Liu et al.","Adolescent; Adult; Audiovisual Aids; Cochlear Implants; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Speech Perception; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; Article; audiovisual equipment; auditory threshold; clinical article; cochlea prosthesis; controlled study; female; gender; hearing; hearing impairment; hearing test; human; male; mandarin; Mandarin Monosyllablic Word Recognition Test; phoneme; speech discrimination; speech perception; word recognition; audiovisual aid; language; physiology; randomized controlled trial; speech perception; young adult","","","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, previous studies have often adopted a unidirectional model examining the influence of discrimination on adolescent development, thus leaving the potential reciprocal relationship between them understudied. Moreover, there is a dearth of studies on Chinese Americans in the discrimination literature. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the reciprocal relationships between discrimination and two measures of adolescent outcomes (i.e., ethnic affect and depressive symptoms) from early adolescence to emerging adulthood in Chinese Americans. Participants were 444 adolescents (54 % female), followed at four-year intervals, beginning at 7th or 8th grade (Mage.wave1 = 13.03) in 2002, for a total of three waves. An examination of cross-lagged autoregressive models revealed two major findings. First, in contrast to the rejection–identification model, perceived discrimination at early adolescence negatively related to ethnic affect at middle adolescence. Conversely, ethnic affect at early adolescence also negatively related to discrimination at middle adolescence. These results held the same direction but became insignificant from middle adolescence to emerging adulthood. Second, perceived discrimination positively related to depressive symptoms across the studied developmental periods, and depressive symptoms positively related to perceived discrimination from middle adolescence to emerging adulthood. The strength of these longitudinal relationships did not change significantly across developmental periods or gender. These findings highlight the bidirectional relationship between perceived discrimination and adolescent outcomes; they also demonstrate the value of studying the discrimination experiences of Chinese Americans. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adolescent; Affect; Asian Americans; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Racism; Surveys and Questionnaires; adolescent; affect; Asian American; depression; ethnology; female; human; longitudinal study; male; psychological rating scale; psychology; questionnaire; racism; statistics and numerical data","Bidirectional relationship; Chinese American; Depressive symptoms; Discrimination; Ethnic identity","","","American Psychological Association Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs; Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD, (5R03HD051629-02); Joseph D.

Our models also test for gender-based discrimination. Empirical results for Belgium suggest significant wage discrimination against women and (to a lesser extent) against immigrants. We find no evidence for double discrimination against female immigrants.

Importance of gender identification system is increasing gradually due to its wide application area. Male-female voice discrimination portrays convincing role in the domain of security services, criminal investigation and speaker identification. Voice based identification of male and female is more robust than the other methods currently available. Constant research is going on to classify male and female voice in a better way. Researchers have worked with various types of features including some time domain features like Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Short Time Energy (STE) because of its capability to represent the physical characteristics of a certain audio signal. Inspiring from the certitude that male female voice discrimination is well reflected in frequency domain due to the contradiction in biological layout of their vocal cord. Being a frequency domain feature, spectral flux has been adopted for this work. This will expectantly discriminate male and female voice precisely. Spectral-flux based features have been used in the suggested effort which is frequency domain feature. The proposed work deals here to generate a co-occurrence matrix from the spectral flux and then to design feature set based on the extracted features from the matrix. For classification purpose some standard classifiers like RANSAC, k-NN and Neural-Net. The experimental result represents the strength of the proposed feature set. © 2017 IEEE.","Frequency domain analysis; Intelligent computing; Matrix algebra; Nearest neighbor search; Time domain analysis; Co-occurrence-matrix; Criminal investigation; Female voices; Gender identification; Physical characteristics; RANSAC; Speaker identification; Spectral flux; Speech recognition","Co-occurrence matrix; Male-female voice discrimination; RANSAC; Spectral flux","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Instrumentation and Control Technologies, ICICICT 2017","136091","Kannur","6 July 2017 through 7 July 2017","","English","Int.

Methods Recruited from epidemiological studies of aging and cognition at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, participants were a community-dwelling cohort of older adults (range 63-98 years) without diagnosis of dementia. The cohort contained roughly equal numbers of Black (n=61) and White (n=63) subjects with groups similar in terms of age, gender, and years of education. Auditory abilities were measured with pure-tone audiometry, speech-in-noise perception, and discrimination thresholds for both static and dynamic spectral patterns. Cognitive performance was evaluated with a 12-test battery assessing episodic, semantic, and working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial abilities. Results Among the auditory measures, only the static and dynamic spectral-pattern discrimination thresholds were associated with cognitive performance in a regression model that included the demographic covariates race, age, gender, and years of education. Subsequent analysis indicated substantial shared variance among the covariates race and both measures of spectral-pattern discrimination in accounting for cognitive performance. Among cognitive measures, working memory and visuospatial abilities showed the strongest interrelationship to spectral-pattern discrimination performance. Conclusions For a cohort of older adults without diagnosis of dementia, neither hearing thresholds nor speech-in-noise ability showed significant association with a summary measure of global cognition. In contrast, the two auditory metrics of spectral-pattern discrimination ability significantly contributed to a regression model prediction of cognitive performance, demonstrating association of central auditory ability to cognitive status using auditory metrics that avoided the confounding effect of speech materials.

Although health care discrimination against transgender people has been documented, this issue is understudied. Using a national cross-sectional survey data set (N=1,711), the authors sought to determine how gender identity and presentation predict health care discrimination experiences among female-to-male (FTM) transgender people after demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled. Analyses were conducted using chi-square tests and a two-step logistic regression. The majority of participants were white (73.9 percent) and between 25 and 44years old (65.2 percent). Overall, 41.8 percent of FTM participants reported verbal harassment, physical assault, or denial of equal treatment in a doctor's office or hospital. When other factors were controlled, being Native American or multiracial, identifying as queer or asexual/other, having a graduate degree, living full-time as nonbirth gender, using hormones or surgery for medical transition, and having identification documents that list one's preferred gender were associated with increased reporting of health care discrimination experiences; being 45years or older and reporting an annual income of $60,000 or more were associated with decreased risk. The study's findings can be useful to social workers, who play a role in educating health care providers and advocating for policies that improve health care experiences for FTM and other transgender patients. © 2015 National Association of Social Workers.","Adolescent; Adult; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Social Discrimination; Transgendered Persons; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; female; health care delivery; human; male; middle aged; questionnaire; social discrimination; transgender; United States; young adult","discrimination; female-to-male individuals; gender identity; health care; transgender individuals","","","","National Association of Social Workers","","","","","","English","Health Soc.

A statistical analysis of the results suggests that skin microtexture carries very little information on gender. © 2016 IEEE.","Capacitive sensors; Skin; Social sciences; Textures; Capacitive imaging; Experimental evaluation; Gender discrimination; Gender recognition; Imaging modality; Supervised classification; Texture features; Unsupervised approaches; Image processing","Gender recognition; Skin; SVM; Texture","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","6th International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications, IPTA 2016","125997","Oulu","12 December 2016 through 15 December 2016","","English","Int.

So it is important to understand how to design classifiers and scores that prevent discrimination in predictions. This paper develops computationally tractable algorithms for designing accurate but fair support vector machines (SVM’s). Our approach imposes a constraint on the covariance matrices conditioned on each protected class, which leads to a nonconvex quadratic constraint in the SVM formulation. We develop iterative algorithms to compute fair linear and kernel SVM’s, which solve a sequence of relaxations constructed using a spectral decomposition of the nonconvex constraint. Its effectiveness in achieving high prediction accuracy while ensuring fairness is shown through numerical experiments on several data sets.

In a sample of 491 African American adolescents (48 % female), associations of youth-reported experiences of racial discrimination and parental messages about preparation for racial bias with adolescents’ later racial identity were examined. Cluster analysis resulted in four profiles of adolescents varying in reported frequency of racial discrimination from teachers and peers at school and frequency of parental racial discrimination coping messages during adolescents’ 8th grade year. Boys were disproportionately over-represented in the cluster of youth experiencing more frequent discrimination but receiving fewer parental discrimination coping messages, relative to the overall sample. Also examined were clusters of adolescents’ 11th grade racial identity attitudes about the importance of race (centrality), personal group affect (private regard), and perceptions of societal beliefs about African Americans (public regard). Girls and boys did not differ in their representation in racial identity clusters, but 8th grade discrimination/parent messages clusters were associated with 11th grade racial identity cluster membership, and these associations varied across gender groups. Boys experiencing more frequent discrimination but fewer parental coping messages were over-represented in the racial identity cluster characterized by low centrality, low private regard, and average public regard. The findings suggest that adolescents who experience racial discrimination but receive fewer parental supports for negotiating and coping with discrimination may be at heightened risk for internalizing stigmatizing experiences. Also, the findings suggest the need to consider the context of gender in adolescents’ racial discrimination and parental racial socialization. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; African Americans; Female; Humans; Male; Parent-Child Relations; Prejudice; Race Relations; Self Concept; Social Adjustment; Social Identification; Social Perception; adaptive behavior; adolescent; adolescent behavior; African American; child parent relation; ethnology; female; human; male; perception; prejudice; psychology; self concept; social adaptation; social behavior; social problem; statistics and numerical data","African American adolescents; Parent racial socialization; Racial discrimination; Racial identity","","","","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","J.

This data enables novel investigations of psychological, anthropological and sociological research questions. However, in the absence of demographic information, such as gender, many relevant research questions cannot be addressed. To tackle this problem, researchers often rely on automated methods to infer gender from name information provided on the web. However, little is known about the accuracy of existing gender-detection methods and how biased they are against certain sub-populations. In this paper, we address this question by systematically comparing several gender detection methods on a random sample of scientists for whom we know their full name, their gender and the country of their workplace. We further suggest a novel method that employs web-based image retrieval and gender recognition in facial images in order to augment name-based approaches. Our findings show that the performance of name-based gender detection approaches can be biased towards countries of origin and such biases can be reduced by combining name-based an image-based gender detection methods. © 2016 owner/author(s).","Social behavior; Comparative evaluations; Computational social science; Demographic information; Detection methods; Discrimination on web; Gender detection; Name based; Research questions; Social behaviour; Social scientists; Image retrieval","computational social science; discrimination on web; gender detection","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","25th International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW 2016","178955","Montreal","11 May 2016 through 15 May 2016","IW3C2","English","WWW Companion - Proc.

In the current study, we addressed this question by experimentally manipulating the salience of gender identity and assessing its impact on women’s decision to confront a sexist comment in a simulated online interaction. Female participants (N = 114) were randomly assigned to complete a short measure of either personal or collective self-esteem, which was designed to increase the salience of personal versus gender identity. They were then given the opportunity to confront a male interaction partner who expressed sexist views. Compared to those who were primed to focus on their personal identity, participants who were primed to focus on their gender identity perceived the interaction partner’s remarks as more sexist and were more likely to engage in confrontation. By highlighting the powerful role of subtle contextual cues in shaping women’s perceptions of, and responses to, sexism, our findings have important implications for the understanding of gender identity salience as an antecedent of prejudice confrontation.

Identification of factors related to this very early risk indicator can help inform early prevention efforts. This study prospectively examined the relationship between childhood adversities and early initiation of alcohol use (by age 14) among Puerto Rican youth, the Latino subgroup at highest risk for alcohol use disorders in adulthood. The data come from the Boricua Youth Study, a longitudinal study of Puerto Rican youth in two sites (South Bronx, New York, and the standard metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico). We focus on youth who were ages 10 and older at Wave 1 [Mage at Wave 1 (SE) = 11.64(0.05), N = 1259, 48.85 % females]. Twelve childhood adversities were measured at Wave 1 and include 10 adverse childhood experiences commonly studied and two additional ones (exposure to violence and discrimination) that were deemed relevant for this study’s population. Early initiation of alcohol use was determined based on youth report at Waves 1 through 3 (each wave 1 year apart). Cox proportional hazards models showed that, when considered individually, adversities reflecting child maltreatment, parental maladjustment, and sociocultural stressors were related to early initiation of alcohol use. Significant gender interactions were identified for parental emotional problems and exposure to violence, with associations found among girls only. Adversities often co-occurred, and when they were considered jointly, physical and emotional abuse, parental antisocial personality, and exposure to violence had independent associations with early alcohol use, with a stronger influence of exposure to violence in girls compared to boys. The accumulation of adversities, regardless of the specific type of exposure, increased the risk for starting to drink at a young age in a linear way. The associations between childhood adversities and early alcohol use were generally consistent across sociocultural contexts, in spite of differences in the prevalence of exposure to adversity. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting multiple adversities and expanding the notion of adversity to capture the experiences of specific groups more adequately. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Child; Child Abuse; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Life Change Events; Longitudinal Studies; Male; New York City; Psychology, Adolescent; Puerto Rico; Underage Drinking; adolescent; adolescent behavior; antisocial personality disorder; child; child abuse; child psychology; comparative study; ethnology; female; Hispanic; human; life event; longitudinal study; male; New York; psychology; Puerto Rico; underage drinking","Alcohol use initiation; Childhood adversities; Cumulative risk; Gender differences; Latinos; Puerto Rican","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (AA020191, HD060072, HL125761, MH56401); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH098374); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (R01DA033172); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","J.

The aim of this study is was to develop a prediction model for gastric cancer incidence based on a large population-based cohort in Korea. Method Based on the National Health Insurance Corporation data, we analyzed 10 major risk factors for gastric cancer. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to develop gender specific prediction models for gastric cancer development, and the performance of the developed model in terms of discrimination and calibration was also validated using an independent cohort. Discrimination ability was evaluated using Harrell's C-statistics, and the calibration was evaluated using a calibration plot and slope. Results During a median of 11.4 years of follow-up, 19,465 (1.4%) and 5,579 (0.7%) newly developed gastric cancer cases were observed among 1,372,424 men and 804,077 women, respectively. The prediction models included age, BMI, family history, meal regularity, salt preference, alcohol consumption, smoking and physical activity for men, and age, BMI, family history, salt preference, alcohol consumption, and smoking for women. This prediction model showed good accuracy and predictability in both the developing and validation cohorts (C-statistics: 0.764 for men, 0.706 for women). Conclusions In this study, a prediction model for gastric cancer incidence was developed that displayed a good performance. © 2015 Eom et al.

Health, psychosocial, and protection services have been implemented in humanitarian settings, but GBV remains under-reported and available services under-utilized. To improve access to existing GBV services and facilitate reporting, the ASIST-GBV screening tool was developed and tested for use in humanitarian settings. This process was completed in four phases: 1) systematic literature review, 2) qualitative research that included individual interviews and focus groups with GBV survivors and service providers, respectively, 3) pilot testing of the developed screening tool, and 4) 3-month implementation testing of the screening tool. Research was conducted among female refugees, aged ≥15 years in Ethiopia, and female IDPs, aged ≥18 years in Colombia. Results: The systematic review and meta-analysis identified a range of GBV experiences and estimated a 21.4 % prevalence of sexual violence (95 % CI:14.9-28.7) among conflict-affected populations. No existing screening tools for GBV in humanitarian settings were identified. Qualitative research with GBV survivors in Ethiopia and Colombia found multiple forms of GBV experienced by refugees and IDPs that occurred during conflict, in transit, and in displaced settings. Identified forms of violence were combined into seven key items on the screening tool: threats of violence, physical violence, forced sex, sexual exploitation, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, and early or forced marriage. Cognitive testing further refined the tool. Pilot testing in both sites demonstrated preliminary feasibility where 64.8 % of participants in Ethiopia and 44.9 % of participants in Colombia were identified with recent (last 12 months) cases of GBV. Implementation testing of the screening tool, conducted as a routine service in camp/district hospitals, allowed for identification of GBV cases and referrals to services. In this phase, 50.6 % of participants in Ethiopia and 63.4 % in Colombia screened positive for recent experiences of GBV. Psychometric testing demonstrated appropriate internal consistency of the tool (Cronbach's α = 0.77) and item response theory demonstrated appropriate discrimination and difficulty of the tool. Conclusion: The ASIST-GBV screening tool has demonstrated utility and validity for use in confidential identification and referral of refugees and IDPs who experience GBV. © 2016 Wirtz et al.","","Colombia; Conflict; Ethiopia; Gender-based violence; Humanitarian setting; Internally-displaced person; Refugees; Screening","","","Bureau of Population; U.S. Department of State, DOS","BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","","","English","Confl.

As a result, I point towards how individual and collective moral agents in digital games culture can pay respect through recognition and affirmation of different groups and identities. At first I establish what constitutes a group and my definition of marginalization. This allows me to identify which specific groups are marginalized in digital games through a literature overview of different research into the representation and inclusion of said group identities. This demarcation and identification of marginalized groups allow me to further propose the ways in which marginalization and discrimination occurs and is reproduced in the domain of digital games. In turn, I propose the ways in which this marginalization and discrimination can be curbed through recognition and affirmation of marginalized groups. As such, I provide and identify the ethical aspects and general actions that moral agents are confronted with and called to act upon.

Openness score is calculated from the number of disclosed items. We study influential factors and their rankings at various disclosure scopes and openness scores. Our findings reveal that gender, profile photo, certain motivations, and risk awareness highly affect private information disclosure activities. However the ranking of influential factors is not uniform. Gender and profile photo have greater influence, however, their influence becomes lower and loses significance as openness is getting higher, falling behind motivations and number of friends. Secondly, we discuss constructing prediction models based on binary logistic regression to predict motivations from number of friends and profile attributes that are visible from the public. We classify motives into inward motive to interact with existing social networking service friends, outward motive to acquire via the SNS, and neutral motive which cannot distinguish whether user have inward or outward motive. Results show that the models can predict motives well and have good discrimination power. Using dimensional reduction, important predictors for optimum models are identified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We have developed predictive models for SVR, and TW8 response using data from boceprevir clinical trials. Methods: Regression models were built to predict TW8 response and SVR. Separate models were built for TW8 and SVR using baseline variables only, and compared to models with baseline variables plus HCV RNA change after 4 weeks of PR (TW4 delta). Predictive accuracy was assessed by c-statistics, calibration curves, and decision curve analyses. Nomograms were developed to create clinical decision support tools. Models were externally validated using independent data. Results: The models that included TW4 delta produced the best discrimination ability. The predictive factors for TW8 response (n = 856) were TW4 delta, race, platelet count and ALT. The predictive factors for SVR (n = 522) were TW4 delta, HCV-subtype, gender, BMI, RBV dose and platelet count. The discrimination abilities of these models were excellent (Cstatistics = 0.88, 0.80 respectively). Baseline models for TW8 response (n = 444) and SVR (n = 197) had weaker discrimination ability (C-statistic = 0.76, 0.69). External validation confirmed the predictive accuracy of the week 4 models. Conclusions: Models incorporating baseline and treatment week 4 data provide excellent prediction of TW8 response and SVR, and support the clinical utility of the lead-in phase of PR. The nomograms are suitable for point-of-care use to inform individual patient and physician decision-making. © 2014 Thompson et al.","Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Decision Trees; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Proline; Reproducibility of Results; Ribavirin; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Viral Load; Young Adult; boceprevir; peginterferon alpha; ribavirin; virus RNA; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; N-(3-amino-1-(cyclobutylmethyl)-2,3-dioxopropyl)-3-(2-((((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)carbonyl)amino)-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-azabicyclo(3.1.0)hexan-2-carboxamide; proline; ribavirin; accuracy; adult; aged; anthropometric parameters; article; body mass; calibration; clinical assessment; comparative study; decision support system; female; hepatitis C; human; major clinical study; male; nomogram; prediction; race; sustained virologic response; thrombocyte count; treatment duration; treatment week eight response; validation study; analogs and derivatives; decision tree; drug combination; genetics; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; middle aged; reproducibility; risk factor; statistical model; time; treatment outcome; virology; virus load; young adult","","","boceprevir, 394730-60-0; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; proline, 147-85-3, 7005-20-1; Antiviral Agents, ; Interferon-alpha, ; N-(3-amino-1-(cyclobutylmethyl)-2,3-dioxopropyl)-3-(2-((((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)carbonyl)amino)-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-azabicyclo(3.1.0)hexan-2-carboxamide, ; Proline, ; Ribavirin, ","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

There is no reliable screening tool to identify people with high risk of developing pancreatic cancer even though pancreatic cancer represents the fifth-leading cause of cancer-related death in Korea. The goal of this study was to develop an individualized risk prediction model that can be used to screen for asymptomatic pancreatic cancer in Korean men and women. Materials and Methods Gender-specific risk prediction models for pancreatic cancer were developed using the Cox proportional hazards model based on an 8-year follow-up of a cohort study of 1,289,933 men and 557,701 women in Korea who had biennial examinations in 1996-1997. The performance of the models was evaluated with respect to their discrimination and calibration ability based on the C-statistic and Hosmer-Lemeshow type χ2 statistic. Results. A total of 1,634 (0.13%) men and 561 (0.10%) women were newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Age, height, BMI, fasting glucose, urine glucose, smoking, and age at smoking initiation were included in the risk prediction model for men. Height, BMI, fasting glucose, urine glucose, smoking, and drinking habit were included in the risk prediction model for women. Smoking was the most significant risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer in both men and women. The risk prediction model exhibited good discrimination and calibration ability, and in external validation it had excellent prediction ability. Conclusion. Gender-specific risk prediction models for pancreatic cancer were developed and validated for the first time. The prediction models will be a useful tool for detecting high-risk individuals who may benefit from increased surveillance for pancreatic cancer. Copyright © 2016 Yu et al.

One of the brain structures implicated in the social abnormalities seen in ASD is the amygdala. To further characterize the impairment of people with ASD in social attention, and to explore the possible role of the amygdala, we employed a series of visual search tasks with both social (faces and people with different postures, emotions, ages, and genders) and non-social stimuli (e.g., electronics, food, and utensils). We first conducted trial-wise analyses of fixation properties and elucidated visual search mechanisms. We found that an attentional mechanism of initial orientation could explain the detection advantage of non-social targets. We then zoomed into fixation-wise analyses. We defined target-relevant effects as the difference in the percentage of fixations that fell on target-congruent vs. target-incongruent items in the array. In Experiment 1, we tested 8 high-functioning adults with ASD, 3 adults with focal bilateral amygdala lesions, and 19 controls. Controls rapidly oriented to target-congruent items and showed a strong and sustained preference for fixating them. Strikingly, people with ASD oriented significantly less and more slowly to target-congruent items, an attentional deficit especially with social targets. By contrast, patients with amygdala lesions performed indistinguishably from controls. In Experiment 2, we recruited a different sample of 13 people with ASD and 8 healthy controls, and tested them on the same search arrays but with all array items equalized for low-level saliency. The results replicated those of Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, we recruited 13 people with ASD, 8 healthy controls, 3 amygdala lesion patients and another group of 11 controls and tested them on a simpler array. Here our group effect for ASD strongly diminished and all four subject groups showed similar target-relevant effects. These findings argue for an attentional deficit in ASD that is disproportionate for social stimuli, cannot be explained by low-level visual properties of the stimuli, and is more severe with high-load top-down task demands. Furthermore, this deficit appears to be independent of the amygdala, and not evident from general social bias independent of the target-directed search. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adult; Amygdala; Attention; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Social Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adult; age; amygdaloid nucleus; Article; attention deficit disorder; autism; body posture; brain damage; clinical article; controlled study; electronics; emotion; eye dominance; eye fixation; eye tracking; facies; female; food; gender; human; male; response time; social interaction; social problem; task performance; visual discrimination; visual stimulation; amygdala; attention; autism; pathology; pathophysiology; perception; photostimulation; physiology; psychology; reaction time; vision; young adult","Amygdala; Autism; Saliency; Social; Visual search","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (P50MH094258); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (R-263-000-A49-112)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Neuropsychologia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We examined how status-legitimizing belief endorsement (SLBs) and gender identification (GID) moderated men and women’s reactions to a man who claimed to have lost a promotion because of anti-male sexism or another cause. Consistent with theory that claiming bias against high-status groups reinforces the status hierarchy, SLB endorsement was associated with more positive reactions toward an anti-male bias claimant for both men and women. Group identification, in contrast, affects group-specific concerns and thus differentially predicted male and female participants’ reactions. Men evaluated the claimant more positively the more strongly they identified with their gender. The more women identified with their gender, the more negatively they evaluated the male claimant. We also demonstrated that SLBs and GID moderated the extent to which the claimant was perceived as sexist. We discuss how these reactions may perpetuate gender inequality. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","","anti-male bias; discrimination; gender identification; status-legitimizing beliefs","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","English","Group Processes Intergroup Relat.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In a cohort comprised of all critically ill adults admitted to five intensive care units at a single tertiary care center over one year, we developed a logistic regression model for the outcome of Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days (MAKE30), the composite of persistent renal dysfunction, new renal replacement therapy (RRT), and in-hospital mortality. Proposed risk factors for the MAKE30 outcome were selected a priori and included age, race, gender, University Health System Consortium (UHC) expected mortality, baseline creatinine, volume of isotonic crystalloid fluid received in the prior 24 h, admission service, intensive care unit (ICU), source of admission, mechanical ventilation or receipt of vasopressors within 24 h of ICU admission, renal replacement therapy prior to ICU admission, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease as defined by baseline creatinine value, and renal failure as defined by the Elixhauser index. Among 10,983 patients in the study population, 1489 patients (13.6%) met the MAKE30 endpoint. The strongest independent predictors of MAKE30 were UHC expected mortality (OR 2.32 [95%CI 2.06–2.61]) and presence of acute kidney injury at ICU admission (OR 4.98 [95%CI 4.12–6.03]). The model had strong predictive properties including excellent discrimination with a bootstrap-corrected area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.903, and high precision of calibration with a mean absolute error prediction of 1.7%.

A validated, brief and easy-to-administer screening tool will help service providers identify GBV survivors and refer them to appropriate GBV services. To date, no such GBV screening tool exists. We developed the 7-item ASIST-GBV screening tool from qualitative research that included individual interviews and focus groups with GBV refugee and IDP survivors. This study presents the psychometric properties of the ASIST-GBV with female refugees living in Ethiopia and IDPs in Colombia. Methods: Several strategies were used to validate ASIST-GBV, including a 3 month implementation to validate the brief screening tool with women/girls seeking health services, aged ≥15 years in Ethiopia (N = 487) and female IDPs aged ≥ 18 years in Colombia (N = 511). Results: High proportions of women screened positive for past-year GBV according to the ASIST-GBV: 50.6 % in Ethiopia and 63.4 % in Colombia. The factor analysis identified a single dimension, meaning that all items loaded on the single factor. Cronbach's α = 0.77. A 2-parameter logistic IRT model was used for estimating the precision and discriminating power of each item. Item difficulty varied across the continuum of GBV experiences in the following order (lowest to highest): threats of violence (0.690), physical violence (1.28), forced sex (2.49), coercive sex for survival (2.25), forced marriage (3.51), and forced pregnancy (6.33). Discrimination results showed that forced pregnancy was the item with the strongest ability to discriminate between different levels of GBV. Physical violence and forced sex also have higher levels of discrimination with threats of violence discriminating among women at the low end of the GBV continuum and coercive sex for survival among women at the mid-range of the continuum. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that the ASIST-GBV has strong psychometric properties and good reliability. The tool can be used to screen and identify female GBV survivors confidentially and efficiently among IDPs in Colombia and refugees in Ethiopia. Early identification of GBV survivors can enable safety planning, early referral for treatment, and psychosocial support to prevent long-term harmful consequence of GBV. © 2016 Vu et al.","adolescent; adult; child; Colombia; Cronbach alpha coefficient; Ethiopia; factorial analysis; female; forced marriage; gender based violence; girl; human; information processing; instrument validation; interview; major clinical study; male; model; patient referral; physical violence; pregnancy; psychosocial care; qualitative research; refugee; reliability; safety; screening; statistical model; survivor","Colombia; Conflict; Ethiopia; Gender-based violence; Humanitarian setting; Internally-displaced person; Psychometric analysis; Refugees; Screening","","","Bureau of Population; U.S. Department of State, DOS","BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","","","English","Confl.

It suggests that this single-axis framework erases Black women in the conceptualization, identification and remediation of race and sex discrimination by limiting inquiry to the experiences of otherwise-privileged members of the group. The chapter focuses on otherwise-privileged group members creates a distorted analysis of racism and sexism because the operative conceptions of race and sex become grounded in experiences that actually represent only a subset of a much more complex phenomenon. It argues that Black women are sometimes excluded from feminist theory and antiracist policy discourse because both are predicated on a discrete set of experiences that often does not accurately reflect the interaction of race and gender.

Recent work has increasingly recognized that emotional vocalizations can color and shape interactions between individuals. Here we present data on the psychometric properties of a recently developed database of authentic nonlinguistic emotional vocalizations from human adults and infants (the Oxford Vocal 'OxVoc' Sounds Database; Parsons, Young, Craske, Stein, & Kringelbach, 2014). In a large sample (n = 562), we demonstrate that adults can reliably categorize these sounds (as 'positive,' 'negative,' or 'sounds with no emotion'), and rate valence in these sounds consistently over time. In an extended sample (n = 945, including the initial n = 562), we also investigated a number of individual difference factors in relation to valence ratings of these vocalizations. Results demonstrated small but significant effects of (a) symptoms of depression and anxiety with more negative ratings of adult neutral vocalizations (R2 = .011 and R2 = .008, respectively) and (b) gender differences in perceived valence such that female listeners rated adult neutral vocalizations more positively and infant cry vocalizations more negatively than male listeners (R2 = .021, R2 = .010, respectively). Of note, we did not find evidence of negativity bias among other affective vocalizations or gender differences in perceived valence of adult laughter, adult cries, infant laughter, or infant neutral vocalizations. Together, these findings largely converge with factors previously shown to impact processing of emotional facial expressions, suggesting a modality-independent impact of depression, anxiety, and listener gender, particularly among vocalizations with more ambiguous valence. © 2016 The Author(s).","Adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; Databases as Topic; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Female; Humans; Individuality; Infant; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Sex Characteristics; Speech Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Voice Quality; Young Adult; adult; anxiety; Article; crying; depression; emotion; facial expression; female; hearing; human; laughter; male; psychometry; sensory stimulation; sex difference; sound analysis; sound detection; speech discrimination; test retest reliability; validation study; vocal cord; vocalization; young adult; adolescent; anxiety disorder; data base; depression; human relation; individuality; infant; psychology; questionnaire; sexual characteristics; speech perception; voice","Adult; Emotional expression; Infant; Stimulus database; Vocalization","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (615539)","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Psychol.

The aim of our study was to assess how accurately adult listeners extract information about the eliciting situation from infant preverbal vocalizations. Vocalizations of 19 infants aged 5-10 months were recorded in 3 negative (Pain, Isolation, Demand for Food) and 3 positive (Play, Reunion, After Feeding) situations. The recordings were later rated by 333 adult listeners on the scales of emotional valence and intensity. Subsequently, the listeners assigned the eliciting situations in a forced choice task. Listeners were almost perfectly able to discriminate whether a recording came from a negative or a positive situation. Their discrimination may have been based on perceived valence as they consistently assigned higher valence when listening to positive, and lower valence when listening to negative, recordings. Ability to identify the particular situation within the negative or positive realm was substantially weaker, with only three of the six situations being discriminated above chance. The best discriminated situation, Play, was associated with high perceived intensity. The weak qualitative discrimination of negative situations seemed to be based on graded perception of negative recordings, from the most intense and unpleasant (assigned to Pain) to the least intense and least unpleasant (assigned to Demand for Food). Parenthood and younger age, but not gender of listeners, had weak positive effects on the accuracy of judgments. Our results indicate that adults almost flawlessly distinguish positive and negative infant sounds, but are rather inaccurate regarding identification of the specific needs of the infant and may normally employ other sensory channels to gain this information. © 2015 Lindová et al.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Auditory Perception; Communication; Comprehension; Emotions; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Sound; Surveys and Questionnaires; Verbal Behavior; adolescent; adult; after feeding; aged; analytical parameters; arousal; Article; auditory discrimination; child behavior; decision making; demand for food; emotionality; female; hearing; human; human experiment; human needs; infant; isolation; male; normal human; pain; parenthood; play; preverbal vocalization; questionnaire; Reunion; sound intensity; sound transmission; verbal communication; vocalization; comprehension; emotion; feeding behavior; interpersonal communication; middle aged; sound; verbal behavior","","","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Under the ""separate but equal"" discrimination of a historic Jim Crow regime, state laws required mandatory separation and discrimination on the front end, while purportedly establishing equality on the back end. In contrast, an Algorithmic Jim Crow regime allows for ""equal but separate "" discrimination. Under Algorithmic Jim Crow, equal vetting and database screening ofall citizens and noncitizens will make it appear that fairness and equality principles are preserved on the front end. Algorithmic Jim Crow, however, will enable discrimination on the back end in the form ofdesigning, interpreting, and acting upon vetting and screening systems in ways that result in a disparate impact. Currently, security-related vetting protocols often begin with an algorithm-Anchored technique of biometric identification-for example, the collection and database screening of scanned fingerprints and irises, digital photographs for facial recognition technology, and DNA. Immigration reform efforts, however, call for the biometric data collection of the entire citizenry in the United States to enhance border security efforts and to increase the accuracy of the algorithmic screening process. Newly developed big data vetting tools fuse biometric data with biographic data and internet and social media profiling to algorithmically assess risk. This Article concludes that those individuals and groups disparately impacted by mandatory vetting and screening protocols will largely fall within traditional classifications-race, color, ethnicity, national origin, gender, and religion. Disparate-impact consequences may survive judicial review if based upon threat risk assessments, terroristic classifications, data- screening results deemed suspect, and characteristics establishing anomalous data and perceived foreignness or dangeroiishess data- nonprotected categories that fall outside of the current equal protection framework. Thus, Algorithmic Jim Crow will require an evolution ofequality law.","","","","","","Fordham University School of Law","","","","","","English","Fordham Law Rev.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Methods: All data for this retrospective study were obtained from the Centre of Forensic Medicine, Toxicology and Molecular Genetics of Clinical Centre of Vojvodina, Novi Sad. Autopsy records for each case included age, gender, BAC, type of vehicle, and date of accident (year, month, and recalculated day of the week). BAC was determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Statistical analysis was carried out by chi-square tests and Student's t test, with P <.05 as a statistical significance, and multiple binary logistic regression. Results: Of the 354 inebriated FIDs (60% of all FIDs), the majority had BACs between of 0.031 and 0.3 mg/ml (28%), followed by those with BAC > 2.01 mg/ml (23%). The average BAC of those driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA) for the whole period was 1.235 ± 1.00 mg/ml and the average number of DUIA/year was 35. Among the total number of FIDs there were significantly more males (93.7%; P <.001) than females (6.3%), though the distribution of intoxicated men and women was not different (P >.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of sober and inebriated FIDs according to age (P <.001) with the predominance of inebriated FIDs between 21 and 30 years. Although gender and age were found to be significant predictors of BAC above legal limit in FIDs, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve showed that the model had poor discrimination (ROC = 0.673). Of all observed FIDs, 65 cases per year were attributed to the first 5-year period (2004–2009) and 49 to the second 5-year (2010–2013) period, which indicates that there was no statistically significant decrease in the number of FIDs after implementation of the new law. Conclusion: The highest number of intoxicated FIDs during the period in AP Vojvodina were mildly and completely inebriated. In the 4-year post-policy period (2010–2013), the number of FIDs and average BAC levels of inebriated FIDs did not significantly change. The abolition of a permissible BAC should be considered. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Intoxication; Automobile Driving; Blood Alcohol Content; Driving Under the Influence; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Public Policy; Retrospective Studies; Safety; Serbia; Young Adult; alcohol blood level; adult; aged; alcohol blood level; Alcoholic Intoxication; car driving; drinking behavior; drunken driving; female; human; legislation and jurisprudence; male; middle aged; mortality; public policy; retrospective study; safety; Serbia; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; young adult","blood alcohol concentration (BAC); driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA); fatally injured drivers; legislation","","Blood Alcohol Content, ","","Taylor and Francis Inc.","","","","","","English","Traffic Inj.

So far, this so-called ‘reactive transnationalism’ has not been studied extensively. Based on literature on discrimination and transnationalism, reactive transnationalism is expected to be most prominent among socioeconomically successful migrants, particularly among males and those who consider themselves Muslims. Our research among middle-class migrants in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, indeed shows that the more respondents experienced discrimination, the more transnationally involved they are, both regarding transnational identifications and transnational activities. While no gender difference was found regarding reactive transnational activities, for women perceived discrimination proves to lead to stronger instead of weaker transnational identifications than for men. The fact that no difference was found between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents regarding reactive transnationalism suggests that, despite heated public debates about ‘Islam’, in the Netherlands, ethnic divides – being considered as ‘Dutch’ or ‘non-Dutch’ – are even more prominent than religious ones. © 2016 The Author(s) Global Networks © 2015 Global Networks Partnership & John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland; Computer networks; Social aspects; Social sciences; DISCRIMINATION; Gender differences; Middle class; Netherlands; Public debate; TRANSNATIONAL ACTIVITIES; Transnational migrants; Transnationalism; economic activity; gender disparity; international migration; migrants experience; racial segregation; religion; socioeconomic status; Regional planning","DISCRIMINATION; TRANSNATIONAL ACTIVITIES; TRANSNATIONAL IDENTIFICATIONS; TRANSNATIONAL MIGRANTS; TRANSNATIONALISM","","","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","English","Global Netw.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, previous fMRI studies did not allow a distinction between the reductions of the response due to stimulus repetitions and fulfilled expectations (expectation suppression, ES). In most prior studies repetitions and expectations were not independent from each other as repetitions occurred more often when they were expected and less often when they were not expected, thereby confounding RS with ES. To overcome this confound, we presented pairs of female and male faces that were either repeating or alternating with an overall probability of 50-50%. Orthogonally to this, the gender of the first face in each pair signaled with 75% accuracy whether repetitions or alternations were more likely to occur. We found significant RS in the FFA, the OFA and the LO. In addition, these areas showed a reduction of the response for expected when compared to surprising trials.

Several types of inflammatory cells and mediators have been found to be involved in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to evaluate the association of the NLR with severity of airflow limitation and disease exacerbations in a COPD population. Methods: We analyzed 885 patients from the Korean COPD Subtype Study cohort that recruited subjects with COPD from 44 referral hospitals. We determined the relationship of NLR levels to severity of lung function using a linear regression model. In addition, we analyzed the experiences of COPD exacerbation according to the NLR quartiles. Results: NLR levels were inversely associated with severity of airflow limitation as measured by FEV1% predicted and absolute values after adjustments for age, gender, body mass index, pack-years of smoking, and the use of inhaled corticosteroid (P<0.001, respectively). In the multivariate binary regression model, the NLR 4th quartile (vs. 1st quartile) was found to be a significant predictor of exacerbations during 1-year follow-up (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.03 to 4.06, P = 0.041). Adding an NLR to FEV1 significantly improved prediction for exacerbations during 1-year follow-up as measured by the net reclassification improvement (NRI = 7.8%, P = 0.032) and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI = 0.014, P = 0.021). Conclusions: The NLR showed a significant inverse relationship to airflow limitation and was a prognostic marker for future exacerbations in patients with COPD. © 2016 Lee et al.

The current study tested four hypotheses: 1) minority stressors vary by current intimate relationship status; 2) higher minority stressors are associated with higher depressive symptoms and alcohol-related outcomes; 3) depressive symptoms and alcohol-related outcomes vary by current intimate relationship status; and 4) minority stressors will mediate differences in these outcomes. Participants included 470 self-identified bisexual women (65 % Caucasian, mean age: 21) from a sample of sexual minority women recruited from different geographic regions in the United States through advertisements on social networking sites and Craigslist. Participants completed a 45 min survey. Respondents with single partners were first grouped by partner gender (male partner: n = 282; female partner: n = 56). Second, women were grouped by partner gender/number (single female/male partner: n = 338; women with multiple female and male partners: n = 132). Women with single male partners and women with multiple male and female partners exhibited elevated experienced bi-negativity and differences in outness (H1). Experienced and internalized bi-negativity were associated with health outcomes, but not outness (H2). Differences in outcomes emerged by partner number and partner number/gender (H3); these differences were mediated by experienced bi-negativity (H4). These results suggest that experiences of discrimination may underlie differences in health related to bisexual women’s relationship structure and highlight the importance of evaluating women’s relational context as well as sexual identification in understanding health risk behaviors. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","","Alcohol outcomes; Bisexual women; Current intimate relationship status; Depression; Minority stress","","","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, (R01AA018292, T32 AA007459); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (YM - R25 CA92408)","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

HIV-infected Guatemalans typically present with late-stage disease. Objective: We employed qualitative methods to explore barriers to HIV testing in Guatemala. Methods: In depth, qualitative interviews were conducted in an HIV testing and treatment facility in Guatemala City. These were analyzed using the methods of Grounded Theory. Results: Four major barriers impeded HIV testing in our subjects: psychological factors, stigma/discrimination, gender roles/machismo, and systemic barriers to care. Many of our patients’ fears were grounded in a reality of discrimination, while the systemic problems of the healthcare system reflected misunderstandings and fears on the part of healthcare workers. Discussion: Our findings are consonant with the international literature. Our narrative suggested potential interventions; presenting HIV testing as a way to “save one’s life” instead of an “automatic death sentence” might foster HIV testing and earlier diagnosis. © 2017, Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

Diagnoses of these disorders require a time-intensive battery of assessments, and these are often only administered after parents, doctors, or teachers show concern. An automated test could enable more widespread screening for speech and language impairments. To build classification models to distinguish children with speech or language impairments from typically developing children, we use acoustic features describing speech and pause events in story retell tasks. We developed and evaluated our method using two datasets. The smaller dataset contains many children with severe speech or language impairments and few typically developing children. The larger dataset contains primarily typically developing children. In three out of five classification tasks, even after accounting for age, gender, and dataset differences, our models achieve good discrimination performance (AUC < 0.70).

The existing dictionary learning approaches simply fix a dictionary atom to be either class-specific or shared by all classes beforehand, ignoring that the relationship needs to be updated during DL. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel latent dictionary learning (LDL) method to learn a discriminative dictionary and build its relationship to class labels adaptively. Each dictionary atom is jointly learned with a latent vector, which associates this atom to the representation of different classes. More specifically, we introduce a latent representation model, in which discrimination of the learned dictionary is exploited via minimizing the within-class scatter of coding coefficients and the latent-value weighted dictionary coherence. The optimal solution is efficiently obtained by the proposed solving algorithm. Correspondingly, a latent sparse representation based classifier is also presented. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms many recently proposed sparse representation and dictionary learning approaches for action, gender and face recognition. © 2014 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Face recognition; Dictionary learning; Discriminative dictionaries; Learned dictionaries; Representation model; Sparse representation; Sparse representation based classifications; sparse represntation; Within class scatter; Atoms","classification; latent dictionary learning; sparse represntation","","","","IEEE Computer Society","27th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2014","114804","Columbus","23 June 2014 through 28 June 2014","","English","Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In-depth analyses of interviews revealed that living in an ethnic enclave enhanced IA adolescents' feelings of belonging to the community. However, the new immigrant status coupled with country of origin determined the permeability of intergroup boundaries with well-established Arab and Arab American peers. Their identity negotiations and social identity salience (national, religious, and pan-Arab) were informed by transitional experiences from home to host country and the prevailing political and cultural tensions between the two, recognition of national hierarchy within the Arab community, perceptions of discrimination by the larger society, changed educational aspirations consequent to immigration, and current physical (school and community) and phenomenological contexts.

BMP is commonplace and important, but there is great inter-individual variability in this ability. This study used multiple regression model analysis to explore the association between BMP performance and intrinsic brain activity, in order to investigate the neural substrates underlying inter-individual variability of BMP performance. The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and BMP performance data were collected from 24 healthy participants, for whom intrinsic brain networks were constructed, and a graph-based network efficiency metric was measured. Then, a multiple linear regression model was used to explore the association between network regional efficiency and BMP performance. We found that the local and global network efficiency of many regions was significantly correlated with BMP performance. Further analysis showed that the local efficiency rather than global efficiency could be used to explain most of the BMP inter-individual variability, and the regions involved were predominately located in the Default Mode Network (DMN). Additionally, discrimination analysis showed that the local efficiency of certain regions such as the thalamus could be used to classify BMP performance across participants. Notably, the association pattern between network nodal efficiency and BMPwas different from the association pattern of static directional/gender information perception.

For example, when applying data mining technologies to university admissions, admission criteria must be non-discriminatory and fair with regard to sensitive features, such as gender or race. In this context, such fairness can be formalized as statistical independence between classification results and sensitive features. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze this formal fairness in order to achieve better trade-offs between fairness and prediction accuracy, which is important for applying fairness-aware classifiers in practical use. We focus on a fairness-aware classifier, Calders and Verwer’s two-naive-Bayes (CV2NB) method, which has been shown to be superior to other classifiers in terms of fairness. We hypothesize that this superiority is due to the difference in types of independence. That is, because CV2NB achieves actual independence, rather than satisfying model-based independence like the other classifiers, it can account for model bias and a deterministic decision rule. We empirically validate this hypothesis by modifying two fairness-aware classifiers, a prejudice remover method and a reject option-based classification (ROC) method, so as to satisfy actual independence. The fairness of these two modified methods was drastically improved, showing the importance of maintaining actual independence, rather than model-based independence. We additionally extend an approach adopted in the ROC method so as to make it applicable to classifiers other than those with generative models, such as SVMs. © 2017, The Author(s).","Data mining; Economic and social effects; Classification results; Cost-sensitive learning; Data mining technology; Discrimination; Fairness; Prediction accuracy; Statistical independence; University admissions; Classification (of information)","Classification; Cost-sensitive learning; Discrimination; Fairness","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16H02864, JP15K00327, JP24500194); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Data Min.

Specifically, the research questions were: (1) What growth rates are produced for Curriculum-Based Measurement early numeracy measures and are these growth rates significant? (2) Do growth rates for Curriculum-Based Measurement early numeracy measures vary by demographic factors such as gender, race, and lunch status? To answer these questions, predictive validity across multiple years was examined for close to 1000 students in grades Kindergarten through 2 on mathematics measures that included Counting, Number Identification, Missing Number, Quantity Discrimination, Number Facts, Next Number, Computation, and Concepts problems. For all grades, results indicated that some measures increased significantly over time. Differences were observed for students at baseline by gender and lunch status and these covariates also produced differences in growth rates, depending on the measure.

Many strong emotions have arisen during this process, both for and against hen. This study aims at analyzing what background factors may explain the attitudes towards hen. In total, 240 individuals participated in our online questionnaire where they indicated their attitude towards hen, as well as responded to questions assessing attitudes towards sexist language (i.e. gender discriminating language), modern sexism (i.e. the belief that gender-discrimination is no longer an issue), political views (from left to right), interest in gender issues and their identification with their own gender identity. The results show no gender difference in attitudes towards hen, but participants strongly identifying themselves with their gender identity had a tendency to be more negative towards the word. Political view was not a significant predictor. However, participants with sexist attitudes had a tendency to dislike hen, whereas those who were interested in gender issues and were negative towards sexist language had a tendency to like the word. Finally, younger age implied a stronger tendency to like hen.","","Attitudes towards sexist language; Feminist language planning; Gender-neutral pronoun; Non-binary gender identity; Nonsexist language; Sexism; Swedish","","","","Adolf Noreen-sallskapet for Svensk Sprak- och Stilforskning","","","","","","Swedish","Sprak Stil","Review","Final","","Scopus"

In terms of sex, gender and sexuality, is a technique that needs to be developed and strengthened, requiring more theoretical reflection and legislative prediction on Brazilian law. In this domain, self-declaration goes against arbitrary, heteronormative and simplifying classifications, informed by gender binarism in essentialist approaches to sexual identities, which ultimately subalternize individuals and groups rather than protect them against discrimination. Based on the ethno-racial debate, it is concluded that self-declaration is adequate and promising as an antidiscriminatory instrument to protect sexual and gender identities. © 2018 Civitas.

A nuanced and detailed examination of how gender identity and threatening experiences tap into their play practices has hitherto been lacking however. The present study fills this gap by examining how female players express a gamer identity and how this relates to perceptions of threat and stigmatization. Based on a large-scale survey directed at female players, a statistical model is specified taking into account how respondents attribute a gamer label to their self-concept. Results suggest that the cognitive, evaluative, and affective dimensions of female identity predict gamer identification in distinct ways. Whereas the mere cognitive process of categorizing as a woman is not related to gamer identity, women who feel closely connected to other women are less inclined to self-identify as gamer. However, group appraisal of womanhood is positively related to identifying as a gamer. When taking into account stigmatization, experienced discrimination by male players seems to discourage women to label themselves as gamer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral research; Human computer interaction; Digital games; Gamer identity; Gender; Social constructionism; Social identity; Women; empiricism; gender; human; perception; social status; statistical model; stereotypy; Surveys","Digital games; Gamer identity; Gender; Social constructionism; Social identity; Women","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Comput.

While women's participation has improved both quantitatively and qualitatively, they continue to encounter a host of barriers attributable to labour market discrimination. A gender-oriented study of job quality is consequently in order.The present paper aims to define and construct a composite index of job quality, compiling objective job security conditions in a single variable that allows the detection of possible gender differences in job quality. Unlike other comparisons of job quality that focus primarily on salary, the composite indicator developed stresses work week duration in an industry in which part-timing impacts women particularly heavily. Findings reveal that women hold lower quality jobs than men and that the gender gap widens with age. Results also show a double adversity for women: a lower job quality in management positions they have not traditionally held, and a wider quality gap in clearly feminized, lower skilled positions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","employment; gender disparity; labor market; service sector; womens status","Composite indicator; Discrimination; Gender; Labour; Labour quality; Women","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Tour.

This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the morphological differences of the LHBT in shoulders with and without deficient rotator cuffs by using quantitative ultrasound.; Materials and Methods: We selected 145 cases with SSFT and 145 age-and- gender-matched controls. The width, thickness, flattening ratio, cross-sectional area, and echogenicity ratio of the LHBT were measured and a general linear model was used to clarify the relationship between rotator cuff pathology and LHBT morphology. The receiver operating characteristic curves of each parameter were constructed for SSFT discrimination and the maximal Youden indexes were used to define the best cut-off points.; Results: We found increased thickness and cross-sectional area but decreased flattening ratio in shoulders with SSFT, and no between-group differences in the width and echogenicity ratio. The LHBT appearance was modified by biceps peritendinous effusion and medial subluxation, but not by the size of SSFT. The flattening ratio was the best discriminator for SSFT with an area under curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.86). The cut-off values to differentiate between the non-tear and tear groups were 2.00 mm of the thickness, 1.73 of the flattening ratio and 10.53 mm2 of the crosssectional area.; Conclusion: Quantitative ultrasound facilitated the detection of the LHBT morphological changes following SSFT and demonstrated its potential utility in discriminating rotator cuff deficiency. © 2014 Chang et al.","Aged; Area Under Curve; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Rotator Cuff; Shoulder Joint; Tendons; adult; Article; biceps brachii muscle; bursitis; calcification; controlled study; cross-sectional study; echography; effusion; female; frozen shoulder; human; long head biceps tendon; major clinical study; male; osteoarthritis; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; subluxation; supraspinatus muscle; supraspinatus tendon full thickness tear; synovitis; tendinitis; tendon; tendon rupture; ultrasound transducer; Youden index; aged; area under the curve; demography; injuries; middle aged; pathology; retrospective study; rotator cuff; shoulder; tendon","","","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The objective of the present study was to monitor the cortical maturation of children with cochlear implants using electrophysiological and auditory skills measurements. The study was longitudinal and consisted of 30 subjects, 15 (8 girls and 7 boys) of whom had a cochlear implant, with a mean age at activation time of 36.4 months (minimum, 17 months; maximum, 66 months), and 15 of whom were normal-hearing children who were matched based on gender and chronological age. The auditory and speech skills of the children with cochlear implants were evaluated using GASP, IT-MAIS and MUSS measures. Both groups underwent electrophysiological evaluation using long-latency auditory evoked potentials. Each child was evaluated at three and nine months after cochlear implant activation, with the same time interval adopted for the hearing children. The results showed improvements in auditory and speech skills as measured by IT-MAIS and MUSS. Similarly, the long-latency auditory evoked potential evaluation revealed a decrease in P1 component latency; however, the latency remained significantly longer than that of the hearing children, even after nine months of cochlear implant use. It was observed that a shorter P1 latency corresponded to more evident development of auditory skills. Regarding auditory behavior, it was observed that children who could master the auditory skill of discrimination showed better results in other evaluations, both behavioral and electrophysiological, than those who had mastered only the speech-detection skill. Therefore, cochlear implant auditory stimulation facilitated auditory pathway maturation, which decreased the latency of the P1 component and advanced the development of auditory and speech skills. The analysis of the longlatency auditory evoked potentials revealed that the P1 component was an important biomarker of auditory development during the rehabilitation process. © 2017 Silva et al.

This bias constitutes a considerable public health problem beyond the effects of excess weight on health. Unfortunately, the few interventions that have been implemented to reduce this bias have not been successful. Evidence that the presence of an animal makes individuals and settings appear more attractive, desirable, approachable, and relaxed, as well as happier and safer, suggests that dog ownership may be a simple way to reduce weight bias. Accordingly, we tested whether the presence of a dog can reduce weight bias in a sample of 314 online participants. Each participant was presented with a stimulus image representing one of three conditions (person with dog, person with plant, or person alone), and was then asked to rate the human model using three measures. Two sets of stimuli (featuring different models) were used to ensure that findings were not restricted to a particular model. Contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence that the presence of a dog affects endorsement of weight-related stereotypes, general evaluations, or desire for social distance. These findings contrast with a large body of literature showing that dogs enhance perceptions of a range of individuals and settings. The effect of dogs on perceptions may be restricted in the case of weight bias because of the pervasive, explicit, and severe nature of this bias. Dogs may have stronger effects on attitudes that are less openly endorsed. Promising avenues where dogs are very likely to influence attitudes include perceptions of individuals of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, gender identities, and even political parties. © 2018 ISAZ.","Animalia; Canis familiaris; canid; gender; literature review; nature-society relations; obesity; perception; public attitude; public health; weight","attitude; canine; human-animal interaction; perception; stigma; weight bias","","","Humane Society International; Morris Animal Foundation, MAF; Human Animal Bond Research Institute, HABRI","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","English","Anthrozoos","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In the last decade, the growth of digital technologies and sales platforms have enabled unprecedented numbers of authors to bypass publishers to publish and sell books. The rise of indie publishing (aka self-publishing) reflects the growth of the “gig” economy, where the influence of firms has diminished and workers are exposed more directly to external markets. Encompassing the traditional and the gig economy, the book industry illuminates how the gig economy may disrupt, replicate, or transform the gender discrimination mechanisms and inequality found in the traditional economy. In a natural experiment spanning from 2002 to 2012 and including over two million book titles, we compare discrimination mechanisms and inequality in indie and traditional publishing. We find that indie publishing, though more egalitarian, largely replicates traditional publishing’s gender discrimination patterns, showing an unequal distribution of male and female authors by genre (allocative discrimination), devaluation of genres written predominantly by female authors (valuative discrimination), and lower prices within genres for books by female authors (within-job discrimination). However, these discrimination mechanisms are associated with far less price inequality in indie, only 7%, in large part due to the smaller and lower range of prices in indie publishing compared to traditional publishing. We conclude that, with greater freedom, workers in the gig economy may be inclined to greater equality but will largely replicate existing labor market segmentation and the lower valuation of female-typical work and of female workers. Nonetheless, price setting for work may be more similar for workers in the gig economy due to market competition that will compress prices ranges. © 2018 Weinberg, Kapelner.

However, participants may be biased by different experimental paradigms to use more or less holistic processing. Here we take a novel psychophysical approach to directly compare human face and object processing in the same experiment, with face processing broken into two categories: variant properties and invariant properties as they were tested using facial expressions of emotion and gender, respectively. Specifically, participants completed two different perceptual discrimination tasks. One involved making judgments of stimulus similarity and the other tested the ability to detect differences between stimuli. Each task was completed for both upright and inverted stimuli. Results show significant inversion effects for the detection of differences in facial expressions of emotion and gender, but not for objects. More interestingly, participants exhibited a selective inversion deficit when making similarity judgments between different facial expressions of emotion, but not for gender or objects. These results suggest a three-way dissociation between facial expression of emotion, gender, and object processing.

Social support and connectedness to the TGNC community can positively impact psychological wellbeing, facilitate resilience, and buffer against external stigmatization, prejudice, and discrimination (Frost & Meyer, 2012; Hendricks & Testa, 2012). The present study seeks to improve understanding of relationships among general social support (GSS), trans community connectedness (TCC), depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. The inclusion of 2 forms of social support allows for greater examination of the differential impact of perceived general support (i.e., from both cisgender and TGNC friends and family members) and TGNC-specific social support (i.e., feeling connected to other TGNC people). To honor the diversity within the TGNC community, the impact of social support was examined among TGNC participants differentiated by gender identity, ethnicity, and living environment. As part of the Internet-based Trans Health Survey, standardized measures of depression, generalized anxiety, and social support were administered to 865 TGNC adults. For both trans male spectrum (TMS) and trans female spectrum (TFS) participants, general social support was significantly negatively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the negative correlation between trans community connectedness and mental health symptoms was significant only for TFS participants. Variations in perceived TCC among ethnicity and living environment groups— distinguished by gender identity—are also explored. Finally, targets for future minority stress and social support research with the TGNC population are discussed. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","","Anxiety; Depression; Social support; Transgender","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Psychol.

Yet research in this area and on whether gender modifies this association is limited for Latina/os. Purpose: The purpose of the present study is to examine whether different sources of discrimination (everyday and racial/ethnic) are associated with substance use (alcohol use disorder, smoking), if racial/ethnic identity buffers this association, and the potential moderating role of gender among these variables. Methods: We present cross-sectional, US population-based data from the Latina/o adult sample (1427 females and 1127 males) of the National Latino and Asian American Study. Respondents completed self-reported measures of everyday and racial/ethnic discrimination, racial/ethnic identity, smoking status, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) lifetime alcohol use disorder. Results: Weighted logistic regression analyses showed that before inclusion of three-way interactions and adjusting for covariates, everyday discrimination predicted increased risk for any DSM-IV lifetime alcohol use disorders. Moderation analyses revealed that the effect of everyday discrimination on the risk of being a current smoker was strongest for Latino men with high levels of racial/ethnic identity compared to those with low racial/ethnic identity. No differences were noted among Latino women. There were no main or interaction effects of racial/ethnic discrimination for any substance use outcome. Conclusions: Findings suggest differential associations for type of discrimination and outcome and that the role of racial/ethnic identity is gender-specific for smoking, appearing particularly detrimental for Latino men reporting high levels of racial/ethnic identity. © 2015, The Society of Behavioral Medicine.","Adult; Alcoholism; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Male; Racism; Risk Factors; Sex Characteristics; Smoking; Social Identification; United States; Young Adult; adult; alcoholism; cross-sectional study; female; health survey; Hispanic; human; male; psychology; racism; risk factor; sexual development; smoking; social behavior; United States; young adult","Alcohol disorders; Cigarette smoking; Gender; Health behaviors; Hispanics; Intersectionality","","","Smith College's Lazarus Center for Career Development; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K12HD055892)","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Ann.

However, few studies have examined the relationship between OPN expression and gastric precancerous diseases, and the potential role of OPN in the formation and development of GC. We investigated the relationships between serum OPN levels and the risks of gastric cancer (GC) and its precancerous disease, to explore the diagnostic efficacy of serum OPN level for GC and atrophic gastritis and its influencing factors. Methods: A total of 1,452 patients were enrolled, including 609 with mild superficial gastritis (SG), 594 with atrophic gastritis (AG) and 249 with GC. The levels of serum OPN and serum Helicobacter pylori IgG antibody were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Serum OPN levels increased from mild SG (1.99±1.91 ng/ml) to AG (2.3±2.27 ng/ml) to GC (5.94±4.52 ng/ml) (P≤0.002), along with increasing severity of gastric disease. OPN levels were significantly higher in patients with GC compared with the non-cancer population (2.17±2.10, P<0.0001). Serum OPN level was positively correlated with age and was higher in men than women, but was not correlated with H. pylori infection status. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.805, the optimal cutoff was 2.56 ng/ml and the sensitivity and specificity were 74.3% and 71.8%, respectively, for the ability of serum OPN to discriminate GC. Conclusions: Serum OPN expression was closely related to the risks of GC and AG, and it might be a useful marker for the discrimination of GC. OPN level was positively correlated with age and male sex, but was not affected by H. pylori infection, and it was promoted by smoking and drinking, in patients with mild SG.

Objective: We aimed to assess the predictive validity of the MBT for incident aMCI. Methods: In a longitudinal, community-based study of adults aged 70, we administered the MBT to 246 cognitively normal elderly adults at baseline and followed them annually. Based on previous work, a subtle reduction in memory binding at baseline was defined by a Total Items in the Paired (TIP) condition score of ≤22 on the MBT. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the predictive validity of the MBT for incident aMCI accounting for the effects of covariates. The hazard ratio of incident aMCI was also assessed for different prediction time windows ranging from 4 to 7 years of follow-up, separately. Results: Among 246 controls who were cognitively normal at baseline, 48 developed incident aMCI during follow-up. A baseline MBT reduction was associated with an increased risk for developing incident aMCI (hazard ratio (HR)=2.44, 95 confidence interval: 1.304.56, p=0.005). When varying the prediction window from 47 years, the MBT reduction remained significant for predicting incident aMCI (HR range: 2.333.12, p: 0.00070.04). Conclusion: Persons with poor performance on the MBT are at significantly greater risk for developing incident aMCI.

This study developed a simple tool for a 5-year CVD risk prediction for primary care Chinese patients with T2DM. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 137,935 primary care Chinese T2DM patients aged 18-79 years without history of CVD between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010. New events of CVD of the cohort over a median follow up of 5 years were extracted from the medical records. A classification rule of 5-year CVD risk was obtained from the derivation cohort and validated in the validation cohort. Significant risk factors included in decision tree were age, gender, smoking status, diagnosis duration, obesity, unsatisfactory control on haemoglobin A1c and cholesterol, albuminuria and stage of chronic kidney disease, which categorized patients into five 5-year CVD risk groups(<5%; 5-9%; 10-14%; 15-19% and ≥20%). Taking the group with the lowest CVD risk, the hazard ratios varied from 1.92(1.77,2.08) to 8.46(7.75,9.24). The present prediction model performed comparable discrimination and better calibration from the plot compared to other current existing models. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cardiovascular Diseases; China; Cohort Studies; Decision Trees; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; adolescent; adult; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; cardiovascular disease; China; classification; clinical trial; cohort analysis; decision tree; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; primary health care; proportional hazards model; risk factor","","","","Food and Health Bureau, FHB, (EPC-HKU-2)","Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","English","Sci.

However, there is increasing recognition that social categorization is often complex, both because category membership can be ambiguous (e.g., multiracial or transgender identities) and because different categorical identities (e.g., race and gender) may interact to determine the meaning of category membership. These complex identities simultaneously impact social perceivers' impressions and social targets' own experiences of identity, thereby shaping perceptions, experiences, and interactions in fundamental ways. This review examines recent research on the perception and experience of the complex, multifaceted identities that both complicate and enrich our lives. Although research has historically tended to focus more on difficulties and challenges associated with multiple identities, increasing attention is being paid to opportunities that emerge from the possession of identities that include multiple distinct or overlapping groups. We consider how these opportunities might benefit both perceivers and targets. © 2015 by Annual Reviews.

A decade later, multiple-race identifiers have become one of the fastest-growing groups in the nation. Such broadening multiracial identification poses important political ramifications and raises questions about the future of minority group political solidarity. Yet we know little about the opinions of multiple-race identifiers and from where those opinions emerge. Bridging literatures in racial politics and political socialization, and drawing upon a multimethod approach, this article provides insight into the consequences of the U.S.'s increasingly blurred racial boundaries by examining the attitudes of Americans of White-Black parentage, a population whose identification was traditionally constrained by the one-drop rule. Findings show that on racial issues such as discrimination and affirmative action, biracials who identify as both White and Black generally hold views akin to Blacks. But on nonracial political issues including abortion and gender/marriage equality, biracials who identify as White-Black or as Black express more liberal views than their peers of monoracial parentage. Being biracial and labeling oneself a racial minority is thus associated with a more progressive outlook on matters that affect socially marginalized groups. Two explanations are examined for these findings: the transmission of political outlook from parents to children, and biracials' experiences straddling a long-standing racial divide. © American Political Science Association 2016.","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","English","Am.

Being based on the Russian sociological and criminological sources, materials of the carried-out questioning, the author comes to a conclusion that the gender stereotypic attitudes in public consciousness of Russians supported by traditions of gender discrimination are one of the factors producing deviant sexual behavior, criminal violence, and having independent victimologic properties. The list of the specified factors in modern society is formulated: introduction in public consciousness by mass media of attitudes to normalization of prostitution; voluntariness of women's prostitution and «guilt» of the female victim of sexual exploitation; public opinion and influence of social moods; influence of the mass media cultivating traditional female roles in the Russian society; gender stereotypes in mass consciousness with accurate identification of participants of the sphere of commercial sex on the basis of sex; viability of stereotypic ideas of a high men's sexual potentiality as standard of courage and sexual hyper-requirements. On the basis of application of qualitative methodology their substantial characteristic is offered. The conclusion is drawn that the traditional gender stereotypes connected to gender as a factor of formation of social roles, need assessment to decrease indicators of mass distribution about prostitution as the social phenomenon, risk of involvement in deviant sexual practices and sexual abuses. © Ruslania 2018.

In Experiment 2, the Portuguese version of Sniffin' Sticks test was administered to 203 healthy participants. Older age, male gender and active smoking status were confirmed as confounding factors. The third experiment showed the validity of the Portuguese version of Sniffin'Sticks test in discriminating healthy controls from patients with olfactory dysfunction. In Experiment 4, the test-retest reliability for both the composite score (r71 = 0.86) and the identification test (r71 = 0.62) was established (p<0.001). Normative data for the Portuguese version of Sniffin'Sticks test is provided, showing good validity and reliability and effectively distinguishing patients from healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity.

Sociocultural identity development is especially relevant during emerging adulthood. Studies examining exacerbating or buffering impacts of ethnic identity have yielded mixed results. The current study examines conditions under which one aspect of ethnic identity, affirmation/belonging, moderates the impact of perceived ethnic discrimination stress on depressive symptoms. This was expected to vary by other-group orientation and gender, in accordance with rejection sensitivity theory. Method: A multicultural sample of 290 non-White immigrant-origin emerging adults (aged 18-25) from mixed cultural backgrounds and generational statuses attending a college in the Southeastern United States completed electronic self-report questionnaires. Results: More robust support was provided for social identity theory rather than rejection sensitivity theory: stronger affirmation/belonging was inversely associated with depressive symptoms across the sample, with a notable buffering impact for women. Trend-level results indicated a protective effect for those endorsing stronger affirmation/ belonging paired with greater other-group orientation. Additionally, women with weaker affirmation/ belonging demonstrated greater increased depressive symptoms compared to men with weaker affirmation/ belonging. Conclusions: For this sample, social identity theory was relevant to the impact of affirmation/belonging on the relation between ethnic discrimination and depressive symptoms contingent on other-group orientation and gender. This finding underscores the importance of examining ethnic identity in a nuanced manner. Implications for these results extend to college counseling centers, where inclusion of sociocultural identity in case conceptualization would be useful. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Depressive Disorder; Emigrants and Immigrants; Ethnic Groups; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Perception; Racism; Self Concept; Social Identification; Southeastern United States; Students; Young Adult; adult; Article; college student; controlled study; depression; ethnicity; female; gender; human; identity; immigrant; male; orientation; other group orientation; questionnaire; racism; rejection sensitivity theory; risk assessment; self report; sensitivity analysis; social identity theory; social status; sociological theory; trend study; United States; young adult; adolescent; coping behavior; depression; ethnic group; gender identity; migrant; perception; psychology; racism; self concept; social behavior; statistics and numerical data; student","Depression; Discrimination; Ethnic identity; Immigrant","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Cult.

However, brain mechanisms underlying these speech processing abnormalities, and to what extent they are related to poor language abilities in this population remain unknown. In the current study, we utilized a novel paired repetition paradigm in order to investigate ERP responses associated with the detection and discrimination of speech and non-speech sounds in 4- to 6 - year old children with ASD, compared with gender and verbal age matched controls. ERPs were recorded while children passively listened to pairs of stimuli that were either both speech sounds, both non-speech sounds, speech followed by non-speech, or non-speech followed by speech. Control participants exhibited N330 match/mismatch responses measured from temporal electrodes, reflecting speech versus non-speech detection, bilaterally, whereas children with ASD exhibited this effect only over temporal electrodes in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, while the control groups exhibited match/mismatch effects at approximately 600 ms (central N600, temporal P600) when a non-speech sound was followed by a speech sound, these effects were absent in the ASD group. These findings suggest that children with ASD fail to activate right hemisphere mechanisms, likely associated with social or emotional aspects of speech detection, when distinguishing non-speech from speech stimuli. Together, these results demonstrate the presence of atypical speech versus non-speech processing in children with ASD when compared with typically developing children matched on verbal age. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

There are several reasons noted for women choosing to identify: (1) exposure to feminist beliefs through education, (2) personal influences such as strong feminist role models, and (3) awareness of gender discrimination. The current research literature on feminism has largely omitted the dynamic and contextual factors that may influence this decision. This study sought to fill this gap by utilizing qualitative methodology to evaluate reasons why contemporary women choose to self-identify as feminist. Overall, the data indicate that a general desire for equality, empowerment, and the freedom to make choices are instrumental in the decision-making process. Further, exposure to feminism, both through education and personal role models, has also led to their self-identification. The implications of these findings, as well as suggestions for the continuation of the feminist movement are discussed. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","feminism; gender roles; qualitative data; self-identification","","","","Routledge","","","","","","English","J.

Research into the motor difficulties in early adulthood and health outcomes has been impeded because there is no agreed gold standard motor test for this group. The purposes of this study were to compare the discrimination accuracy, classification agreement, and predictive values, and gender distribution and prevalence of each test in identifying motor impairment (MI) in relation to DSM-V diagnostic criteria for DCD. Ninety-one young, healthy adults (M = 21.4 years, SD = 3.3) were recruited. Those classified as MI by each test scored at one standard deviation or more below the overall mean standard score. Small, statistically significant correlations were found between the MAND and BOT-2 SF tests for score rank (r = 0.370, p = 0.01) and standard score values (r = 0.404; p = 0.01). The overall decision agreement for non-MI cases was relatively high at 85% but very low for MI cases (4.4%). Unexpectedly, gender was balanced in MI cases. BOT-2 SF identified twice as many MI cases than MAND (13.2% vs 6.6%), yet overall comparative test specificity was high (89%). Predictive values for MAND, compared against BOT-2 SF as the standard, indicated broad independence between these tests and overall, the decision statistics indicated that the two tests identified different adult cohorts with MI. Objective classification of adult motor proficiency using a gold standard assessment tool including complex and ecologically valid tasks is still elusive. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adult; Child; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Motor Skills; Motor Skills Disorders; Sensitivity and Specificity; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; Article; Australian; Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; developmental coordination disorder; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; discriminant validity; DSM-5; female; gold standard; human; male; McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development; motor dysfunction; motor dysfunction assessment; motor function test; motor performance; normal human; predictive value; prevalence; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; young adult; child; comparative study; disability; learning; motor performance; pathophysiology; physiology; psychomotor disorder; questionnaire","Discrimination statistics; Motor assessment; Test validity; Young adults","","","School of Psychology & Speech Pathology; Curtin University of Technology","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","English","Hum.

For one group of participants, the gender shown on the video matched the gender of the voice heard, and for the other group they were mismatched.

The chapter analyzes, what kind of meanings are given to gender identification, sexual orientation and gender. The analysis is based on the responses and stories of non-heterosexual and trans youth in a survey produced in 2013 by the Finnish gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans and intersexual (GLBTI) human rights organization Seta and the Finnish Youth Research Network. The survey data used for this chapter consists of 1861 responses, of which 994 were written by non-heterosexual women, 380 by non-heterosexual men, 404 by transmasculine respondents, and 83 by transfeminine respondents. Differences and similarities between these groups of respondents in relation to their experiences of work and career choice are described. The survey and stories reveal that trans youth experience their situation at work as more challenging than non-heterosexual youth. There are also gendered differences between non-heterosexual women and men, as well as between transfeminine and transmasculine respondents. Young people still have to face many challenges in heteronormative workplaces, and heteronormative expectations affect their career choices. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Discrimination; Gay; Homosexuality; Lesbian; Sexual orientation; Transgender; Workplace","","","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","English","Sex.

In conventional LBP, the problem of sensitivity to intensity change usually constrains its practicality due to its pixel-based comparison in the encoding mechanism. Different from LBP, the proposed LBDP describes the local texture information by extending the encoding mechanism from pixel-based comparison to blockbased comparison so as to extracting more detailed information. The discrimination capability of LBDP is thus enhanced because the difference of local structures and the similarity of neighboring blocks are both considered in the proposed encoding mechanism. Moreover, the proposed LBDP can decrease the influence resulting from intensity change because of the expanding of encoding range. The validity and excel performance of the proposed LBDP is demonstrated in the application of gait-based gender classification. In the experiments, CASIA dataset B is adopted for performance evaluation and the results demonstrate that the proposed LBDP outperforms the other local texture descriptors.","Encoding (symbols); Pixels; Textures; Difference patterns; Encoding mechanism; Gait sequences; Gender classification; Intensity change; LBDP; Local structure; Local Texture; Signal encoding","Gait sequence; Gender classification; LBDP; LBP; Local texture descriptor","","","","Institute of Information Science","","","","","","English","J.

The approach aims to detect changes in the initial accuracy of the model after training and when the model is deployed for recognizing new unseen activities without access to the ground truth. The changes between the two sessions may occur because of differences in sensor placement, orientation and user characteristics such as age and gender. However, many of the existing approaches for model adaptation in activity recognition are blind methods because they continuously adapt the recognition model without explicit detection of changes in the model performance. Design/methodology/approach: The approach determines the variation between reference activity data belonging to different classes and newly classified unseen data. If there is coherency between the data, it means the model is correctly classifying the instances; otherwise, a significant variation indicates wrong instances are being classified to different classes. Thus, the approach is formulated as a two-level architectural framework comprising of the off-line phase and the online phase. The off-line phase extracts of Shewart Chart change parameters from the training data set. The online phase performs classification of new samples and the detection of the changes in each class of activity present in the data set by using the change parameters computed earlier. Findings: The approach is evaluated using a real activity-recognition data set. The results show that there are consistent detections that correlate with the error rate of the model. Originality/value: The developed approach does not use ground truth to detect classifier performance degradation. Rather, it uses a data discrimination method and a base classifier to detect the changes by using the parameters computed from the reference data of each class to discriminate outliers in the new data being classified to the same class. The approach is the first, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, that addresses the problem of detecting within-user and cross-user variations that lead to concept drift in activity recognition. The approach is also the first to use statistical process control method for change detection in activity recognition, with a robust integrated framework that seamlessly detects variations in the underlying model performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Activity recognition; Change detection; Concept drift; Machine learning; Model adaptation","","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","English","Int.

In certain situations, the presence of related covariate, continuous or categorical, to the diagnostic variable can increase the discriminating power of the ROC curve [3]. The Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) scale, appeared in 1993 to predict the mortality of babies with very low birthweight (VLBW) and/or less than 32 weeks of gestation [2]. Braga and Oliveira [1] concluded that this index performs well in computing the risk of death for VLBW infants (< 1500 g). In previous works, the authors studied the effect of the baby’s sex [17] and the mother’s age [18] on CRIB scale, using results of an intensive care unit of a Portuguese hospital. In the present work, we propose to analyze the discriminative power of CRIB scale, using ROC regression analysis with GLM (Generalized Linear Models), in the classification of babies with and without the presence of covariates (newborn gender and mothers age). This study is carried out using a random sample obtained from data collected during the period from 2010 − 2012.

The base corpus includes over 20 K recordings (approx. 30 h), collected from 120 children. Audio recordings are carried out in three controlled settings by creating different emotional states for children: playing with a standard set of toys; repetition of words from a toy-parrot in a game store setting; watching a cartoon and retelling of the story, respectively. This corpus is designed to study the reflection of the emotional state in the characteristics of voice and speech and for studies of the formation of emotional states in ontogenesis. A portion of the corpus is annotated for three emotional states (comfort, discomfort, neutral). Additional data include the results of the adult listeners’ analysis of child speech, questionnaires, as well as annotation for gender and age in months. We also provide several baselines, comparing human and machine estimation on this corpus for prediction of age, gender and comfort state. While in age estimation, the acoustics-based automatic systems show higher performance, they do not reach human perception levels in comfort state and gender classification.

These are still reflected on present reformulations of gender dysphoria in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and the International Classification of Diseases, and in more or less subtle micro-aggressions experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans patients in mental health care. The present paper critically reviews this history and current controversies. It reveals that this deeply complex field contributes (i) to the reflection on the very concept of mental illness; (ii) to the focus on subjective distress and person-centered experience of psychopathology; and (iii) to the recognition of stigma and discrimination as significant intervening variables. Finally, it argues that sexual orientation and gender identity have been viewed, in the history of the field of psychopathology, between two poles: gender transgression and gender variance/fluidity. Numerous controversies and debates have taken place throughout the history of psychopathology and mental health care with regards to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.

This study examined a range of anthropometric variables and their relationships with cardiometabolic features and type 2 diabetes in order to ascertain whether measurement site influences discriminatory accuracy. In particular, we compared waist circumference (WC) measured at two sites: (1) immediately below the lowest rib (WC rib) and (2) between the lowest rib and iliac crest (WC midway), which has been recommended by the World Health Organisation and International Diabetes Federation. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving a random sample of 2,002 men and women aged 46-73 years. Metabolic profiles and WC, hip circumference, pelvic width and body mass index (BMI) were determined. Correlation, logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to evaluate obesity measurement relationships with metabolic risk phenotypes and type 2 diabetes. Results: WC rib measures displayed the strongest associations with non-optimal lipid and lipoprotein levels, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose, a clustering of metabolic risk features and type 2 diabetes, in both genders. Rib-derived indices improved discrimination of type 2 diabetes by 3-7% compared to BMI and 2-6% compared to WC midway (in men) and 5-7% compared to BMI and 4-6% compared to WC midway (in women). A prediction model including BMI and central obesity displayed a significantly higher area under the curve for WC rib (0.78, P=0.003), Rib/height ratio (0.80, P<0.001), Rib/pelvis ratio (0.79, P<0.001), but not for WC midway (0.75, P=0.127), when compared to one with BMI alone (0.74). Conclusions: WC rib is easier to assess and our data suggest that it is a better method for determining obesity-related cardiometabolic risk than WC midway. The clinical utility of rib-derived indices, or alternative WC measurements, deserves further investigation. © 2015 Millar et al.

While this contributes to our understanding of the nature of work in the digital economy and the extent to which current labour law is problematic for some platform workers, the gender dimension and implications, especially the growing concern about discrimination between men and women in the digital economy, appear to have received little attention so far. A recent study showed that some female platform workers receive lower pay than their male counterparts. As some online platforms use algorithms to determine pay levels, the key question addressed here is to the extent to which current EU gender equality law, and the principle of equal pay for women and men in particular, is adequate for protecting platform workers in a situation where work-related decisions are not taken by a human being but by an algorithm that is the potential source of discrimination. To understand how regulation should be 'calibrated' in cases where algorithms result in discrimination, the theory of classification bias can be helpful. It is assumed that the reason for providing protection based on the equal pay principle to a specific group of employees is not compelling enough to exclude platform workers who are classified as self-employed. This article starts with a brief examination of the challenges of working in the digital economy and then goes on to analyse the role of algorithms and their potential to discriminate based on gender. It is argued that the theory of classification bias could be used to address discriminatory algorithmic decision-making. The theory is then applied to the EU's principle of equal pay for women and men, suggesting some improvements in relation to platform work. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.","","","","","","Wolters Kluwer (UK) Ltd.","","","","","","English","Int.

This study aimed to validate K-T in a memory clinic setting by examining its capacity to discriminate older adults with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Method: K-T was administered to 120 NC subjects, 146 patients with MCI, and 93 patients with AD. A one-way analysis of covariance was used to compare the correct cancellations of K-T between the groups. Linear regressions were run to identify significant demographic predictors of K-T for NC subjects and to determine the equation to calculate z scores for all subjects. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were assessed to compare the diagnostic performance between K-T and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for discrimination between NC subjects and patients with cognitive impairment. Results: After adjusting for age, education, and gender, the groups were significantly different from each other regarding the number of correct cancellations of K-T, F(2, 353) = 116.6, p <.001, η2                             p =.40. Compared to the NC group (Z = 0, SD = 1), the mean z score was –1.52 for the MCI group and –2.53 for the AD group, suggesting impaired performance for the patient groups. K-T showed a better diagnostic performance for discrimination between the NC subjects and the patients with MCI (AUC =.83; 95% CI [.79,.88]; Se =.79; Sp =.74; PPV =.79; NPV =.74), compared to that of MMSE (AUC =.74, 95% CI [.68,.80]; Se =.68; Sp =.73; PPV =.79; NPV =.64). Conclusion: The K-T cancellation test showed a good diagnostic performance in discriminating cognitively normal older adults from cognitively impaired patients. Our findings support the clinical utility of K-T in geriatric neuropsychological assessment for detection of early cognitive impairment. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition Disorders; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Memory Disorders; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; aged; Alzheimer disease; cognitive defect; executive function; female; human; male; memory; memory disorder; middle aged; neuropsychological test; physiology; psychology; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly","Alzheimer’s disease; Executive function; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuropsychological test; Psychometrics","","","","Routledge","","","","","","English","J.

The DRLSE level set method is used for identifying the face location, in which we propose to use a reinitialization step to accelerate the speed of finding the face contours. Gabor wavelet transformation is also used to extract the eye and eyebrow regions of a face, from which a set of triplet parameters are created as ratio values in term of the eye and eyebrow features. A three dimensional linear discrimination algorithm is applied to this set of triplet parameters. This gender identification method takes advantage of the invariant ratio of feature distances to build a criterion that is robust and avoids potential problems caused by the change of the field of view (FOV). The criterion is further applied to a set of testing face images to identify the gender of each individual human face, and improved accuracy rate is achieved. © International Conference on Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Pattern Recognition, IPCV 2015.All right reserved.","Computer vision; Image enhancement; Linear transformations; Numerical methods; Wavelet transforms; Gabor wavelet transformation; Gender identification; Human face recognition; Level set functions; Linear discriminants; Face recognition","3D linear discriminant method; Gabor wavelet transformation; Gender identification; Human face recognition; Level set function","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Illinois State Academy of Science, ISAS, (1036257)","CSREA Press","2015 International Conference on Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Pattern Recognition, IPCV 2015, at  WORLDCOMP 2015","150203","Las Vegas","27 July 2015 through 30 July 2015","","English","Proc.

In a nutshell, it talks about the massive quantity of public funds for procurement (In Spain it is around 20% of the GDP) and fulfilling the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy. This strategy establishes three main priorities: a) intelligent growth through more efficient investments in education, investigation and innovation; b) sustainable growth driving a low carbon economy and fighting against global warming; and inclusive growth, highlighting job creation and poverty reduction. In relation to this strategy, the European Commission has issued ""50 proposals for improving our work, business and exchanges with one another"" and ""Twelve levers to booost growth and strengthen confidence"". One of these twelve priorities is a revised and modernised regulatory framework for public contracts to achieve, among other aims, environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and innovative procurement. However, the procurement potential has encountered some difficulties with certain elements of the procurement requirements and especially with the interpretation of the contractual principles. These are central, but most are skewed towards the purely economic aspect of procurement. As a result, social and environmental aspects are placed at different levels, but properly linked to the main subject matter of each contract. In this view, ""the most advantageous economic proposal"" barely serves the general interests attached to the contract and creates a clash between the main subject matter and the main goal of the general interest. These difficulties are reflected in the high number of consultations and conflicts resolved in the courts: the social clauses have a place in several areas of the contract but in practice, all of them present almost insoluble problems in their ""link to the subject matter of the contract"" and as regards the procurement principles (free competition, equality and non-discrimination). This is what happens when their inclusion has been demanded as a criterion for adjudication of the contract and even, to a lesser extent, as a special condition for execution. At this moment, the present study has found many resolutions of consultative agencies in matters of procurement as well as court rulings that show the difficulties: in a word, the ""ubiquity"" of social clauses has become a problem of ""location"". The Public Administrations that are more sensitive towards incorporating social elements in their contractual activity have ended up testing different legal formulas, through imaginative definitions of the contract, for instance, or, the riskiest, passing legislation they require their procurement staff to stand by. All the possibilities devised pose legal validity problems, as shown in several judicial proceedings. Our proposal calls for taking advantage of the moment of regulatory reform obliged by the 2014 Directives to advance the role of procurement in achieving objectives of general interest and social character. Moreover, we consider that both the Europe 2020 strategy and the Directives require that changes be projected in the following areas: 1. From a negative point of view (i.e. determining consequences for everyone who violates social (or other) postulates), the warranty of the State, in the execution of public contracts, is required to ensure that economic operators comply with their legal obligations in environmental, social or labour matters. 2. The active or positive level is more complex because we do not see many differences between current and previous directives. The recitals of Directive 2014/24 / EU show a wish to advance the inclusion of social criteria, but there are problems in their mandatory use and their generalization to all public contracting activity. In Spain the draft bill incorporates some interesting innovations: the list of tiebreakers include insertion companies, non-profit entities, companies that incorporate measures favouring the extension of gender equality. They have also introduced new options in the special conditions of implementation of a social nature and are firmly committed to supporting small and medium enterprises. In any case, the most important obstacle is the requirement of linkage to the subject matter of the contract, although there is a certain flexibility in the new rules to the extent that it seems not to be required to be ""direct"". We believe that the solution to the problem is to accept that social clauses and public contracts serve different purposes, in a natural process, and are not called unfailingly to interbreed. That is why, in line with some doctrines, we advocate proposals that have already been made for a comprehensive vision that understands that recruiting is not an objective in itself, but an instrument at the service of public needs of a very different character. The principle of efficiency requires linking the use of public funds (obviously also intended procurement) to the satisfaction of the general interest, a generic goal which materializes in multiple purposes (social, ecological, innovation and research, ...). From the foregoing we put forward some concrete proposals: a) clear identification of the area where social clauses should be included in the contract; b) removing the rigidity of the direct link with the subject matter of the contract and interpreting this linkage in a broader and more flexible way; c) requiring the objectives to include evaluation of the impact on recruitment. The latter proposal is also linked to the impact analysis, an essential ingredient of the so-called smart regulation which is also part of the Europe 2020 Strategy. © 2016 CIRIEC-España.","","Accounting reform; Governmental accounting; Local authorities; Setting of accounting standards process in the public sector","","","","CIRIEC","","","","","","Spanish","CIRIEC Esp.

There is a need to create such facilitated pedagogical spaces where participants can share their ways of knowing and doing. The aim of this exploratory study was to introduce pedagogical space for sociocultural interaction using 'Identity Text'. Methods: Identity Texts are sociocultural artifacts produced by participants, which can be written, spoken, visual, musical, or multimodal. In 2013, participants of an international medical education fellowship program were asked to create their own Identity Texts to promote discussion about participants' cultural backgrounds. Thematic analysis was used to make the analysis relevant to studying the pedagogical utility of the intervention. Result: The Identity Text intervention created two spaces: a 'reflective space', which helped participants reflect on sensitive topics such as institutional environments, roles in interdisciplinary teams, and gender discrimination, and a 'narrative space', which allowed participants to tell powerful stories that provided cultural insights and challenged cultural hegemony; they described the conscious and subconscious transformation in identity that evolved secondary to struggles with local power dynamics and social demands involving the impact of family, peers, and country of origin. Conclusion: While the impact of providing pedagogical space using Identity Text on cognitive engagement and enhanced learning requires further research, the findings of this study suggest that it is a useful pedagogical strategy to support cross-cultural education. © 2016 Zareen Zaidi et al.","Culture; Education, Medical; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Learning; Politics; Sexism; Social Identification; Social Support; Teaching; artifact; discourse analysis; exploratory research; family; female; human; human experiment; identity; learning; male; medical education; narrative; sexism; thematic analysis; cultural anthropology; human relation; medical education; organization and management; politics; social behavior; social support; teaching","Cross-cultural education; Discourse analysis; Educational cultural hegemony; Pedagogical space; Sociocultural theory","","","","Co-Action Publishing","","","","","","English","Med.

As Liben correctly points out, many single-sex education programs are animated by claims regarding “hard wired” biological sex difference, and proponents tend to value personal experience and anecdote over scientific approaches to data. This commentary recognizes the contribution Liben makes in situating supporters of single-sex education within a particular historical tradition and illuminating their values. However, it argues that while gender essentialism and resulting claims regarding typical male and female tendencies may be established intellectual philosophies, they are of limited value from a practical legal perspective. Similarly, while anecdotes and personal experience have real power, they are legally insufficient to support sex-based classifications enshrined by public schools. The commentary builds on the link Liben has drawn between historical gender essentialist views surrounding women’s education and contemporary proponents of single-sex education by providing examples of how these views are currently being applied in classrooms across the U.S. It then provides a discussion of the development of sex-discrimination law, demonstrating how historical examples of gender essentialism in law were ultimately rejected by the courts. Through a discussion of the legal requirements governing single-sex education, the commentary attempts to illustrate the relevance of both evidence and gender-essentialism in legal determinations about the permissibility of single-sex education programs in the United States. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","","Civil rights; Discrimination; Educational policy; Evidence; Gender constructivism; Gender differences; Gender essentialism; Single-sex education; Stereotypes; Title IX","","","","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Deportees are often returned to unfamiliar communities where they may experience emotional and socioeconomic stressors that may raise their risk for engaging in unsafe behaviors. Objective This exploratory study describes adaptation to the post-deportation environment among Mexican-born injection drug-using women. Method In 2008, we conducted qualitative interviews in Tijuana with 12 women reporting U.S. deportation. Our analytic framework focused on acculturation stress, adaptation and social capital in relation to HIV risk, considering a gender perspective. Results We found that the stress caused by the deportation experience and acclimating to the post-deportation community may have contributed to the women's participation in high-risk HIV behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, sex work). Female deportees reported limited access to post-deportation social capital resources (e.g., social support, healthy social networks). Social factors (e.g., discrimination, lack of a government identification) challenged women's resettlement and likely contributed to economic and health vulnerabilities. Discussion and conclusion These preliminary findings suggest that deportees may benefit from organized services at repatriation, including mental health screening. Macro-level interventions that address stigma and facilitate deportees' economic integration may help stem engagement in risk behaviors.","","Acculturation; Deportation; Females IDUs; Hispanic women; HIV; Mental health; Mexico","","","","Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente","","","","","","English","Salud Ment.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods We searched the MEDLINE and Web of Science electronic databases (until January 2016). Studies were eligible if they derived a model to predict mortality of AKI patients or externally validated at least one of the prediction models, and presented area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUROC) to assess model discrimination. Studies were excluded if they described only results of logistic regression without reporting a scoring system, or if a prediction model was generated from a specific cohort. Results A total of 2204 potentially relevant articles were found and screened, of which 12 articles reporting original prediction models for hospital mortality in AKI patients and nine articles assessing external validation were selected. Among the 21 studies for AKI prediction models and their external validation, 12 were single-center (57%), and only three included more than 1,000 patients (14%). The definition of AKI was not uniform and none used recently published consensus criteria for AKI. Although good performance was reported in their internal validation, most of the prediction models had poor discrimination with an AUROC below 0.7 in the external validation studies. There were 10 common non-renal variables that were reported in more than three prediction models: mechanical ventilation, age, gender, hypotension, liver failure, oliguria, sepsis/septic shock, low albumin, consciousness and low platelet count. Conclusions Information in this systematic review should be useful for future prediction model derivation by providing potential candidate predictors, and for future external validation by listing up the published prediction models. © 2017 Ohnuma, Uchino.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Acute Kidney Injury; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Prognosis; Risk Factors; acute kidney failure; age distribution; albumin blood level; Article; artificial ventilation; consciousness level; hospital mortality; human; hypotension; liver failure; mortality rate; oliguria; prediction; renal replacement therapy; sepsis; septic shock; sex difference; systematic review; thrombocyte count; validation study; acute kidney failure; female; male; mortality; prognosis; risk factor; theoretical model","","","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This persistent disparity contributes to increased influenza-related morbidity and mortality in the African American population. Most scholarship on vaccine disparities has compared Whites and Blacks. Employing Public Health Critical Race Praxis, this study seeks to shift the focus to explore differences within the Black population. Utilizing a nationally-representative 2015 survey of US Black adults (n = 806), we explore differences by gender, age, income, and education across vaccine-related measures (e.g., perceived risk, knowledge, attitudes) and racial factors (e.g. racial salience, racial fairness, perceived discrimination). We also explore differences by vaccine behavior in the past five years among those who vaccinate every year, most years but not all, once or twice, and never. Greater frequency of flu vaccine uptake was associated with better self-reported vaccine knowledge, more positive vaccine attitudes, more trust in the flu vaccine and the vaccine process, higher perceived disease risk, lower perceived risk of vaccine side effects, stronger subjective and moral norms, lower general vaccine hesitancy, higher confidence in the flu vaccine, and lower perceived barriers. Logistic regression results highlighted other significant differences among the groups, emphasizing areas to target for improved vaccination rates. We find great diversity within the Black community related to influenza immunization decisions, highlighting the need to “break down the monolith” in future research. © 2017","influenza vaccine; adult; African American; age distribution; Article; attitude; Black person; decision making; educational status; female; health hazard; health survey; household income; human; knowledge; male; middle aged; morality; prediction; priority journal; racial consciousness; racial fairness; racial salience; racism; risk assessment; self report; sex difference; trust; unspecified side effect; vaccination; young adult","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","SSM Popul.

This paper investigates how to build discrimination-aware models even when the available training set is intrinsically discriminating based on some sensitive attributes, such as race, gender or personal status. We propose a new classification method called Discrimination-Aware Association Rule classifier (DAAR), which integrates a new discriminationaware measure and an association rule mining algorithm. We evaluate the performance of DAAR on three real datasets from different domains and compare it with two non-discrimination-aware classifiers (a standard association rule classification algorithm and the state-of-the-art association rule algorithm SPARCCC), and also with a recently proposed discrimination-aware decision tree method. The results show that DAAR is able to effectively filter out the discriminatory rules and decrease the discrimination on all datasets with insignificant impact on the predictive accuracy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Algorithms; Association rules; Big data; Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision trees; Filtration; Trees (mathematics); Association rule algorithm; Biased decision makings; Classification algorithm; Classification methods; Decision tree method; Predictive accuracy; Rule mining algorithms; Sensitive attribute; Data mining","Association rule classification; Discrimination-aware data mining; Unbiased decision making","","","","Springer Verlag","17th International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery, DaWaK 2015","139449","Valencia","1 September 2015 through 4 September 2015","","English","Lect.

While this may indicate that the primary impairment is perceptual, it is conceivable that some cases of DP are instead caused by a memory impairment, with any perceptual complaint merely allied rather than causal. To investigate this possibility, we administered a battery of face perception tasks to 11 individuals who reported that their face recognition difficulties disrupt daily activity and who also performed poorly on two formal tests of face recognition. Group statistics identified, relative to age- and gender-matched controls, difficulties in apprehending global–local relations and the holistic properties of faces, and in matching across viewpoints, but these were mild in nature and were not consistently evident at the level of individual participants. Six of the 11 individuals failed to show any evidence of perceptual impairment. In the remaining five individuals, no single perceptual deficit, or combination of deficits, was necessary or sufficient for poor recognition performance. These data suggest that some cases of DP are better explained by a memorial rather than perceptual deficit, and highlight the relevance of the apperceptive/associative distinction more commonly applied to the allied syndrome of acquired prosopagnosia. © 2016 The Experimental Psychology Society.","Adult; Analysis of Variance; Association; Face; Facial Expression; Famous Persons; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Prosopagnosia; Recognition (Psychology); Signal Detection, Psychological; adult; analysis of variance; association; decision making; face; facial expression; female; human; male; middle aged; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; pattern recognition; perceptive discrimination; physiology; prosopagnosia; public figure; recognition","Face blindness; Individual differences; Memory; Perception","","","British Academy, (97414)","Psychology Press Ltd","","","","","","English","Q.

They purchase aggregate gender statistics on groups of requests from a third party. This project explores creating groups of requests in which at least 80% of the advertisement requests have the same gender using: 1) traditional clustering algorithms, 2) iterative linear regression algorithm-ITRA-and 3) qualitative clustering algorithm (ROCK). In all cases, the data used was either browsing history data or synthetic attributes created by dimensionality reduction to more simply describe that history. These three approaches were unable to consistently create the desired gender discrimination. None of these three approaches proved to be the preferred alternative as the performance of each varied drastically as the test data set, and even subsets of that test data set changed. However, amongst the data sets used, these methods were able in some instances to create small buckets (less than 3,000 requests) with the desired gender distribution. The success or failure of these algorithms was dependent upon how similar individual requests were to one another (i.e. how many attributes were on average shared between requests). The approaches performed better in those instances in which more attributes were shared between requests, i.e., the requests contained information that allowed for the classification of the requests. © 2016 IEEE.","Algorithms; Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Iterative methods; Marketing; Population statistics; Social sciences; Statistical tests; Clustering; Demographic Analysis; Dimensionality reduction; Iterative regression; Linear regression algorithms; Online advertisements; Online video advertising; Traditional clustering; Clustering algorithms","Advertising; Clustering; Demographic Analysis; Iterative-Regression","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2016","122290","Charlottesville","29 April 2016","","English","IEEE Syst.

Disease-related reductions in speed and step length can be improved by providing rhythmical auditory cues via a metronome or music. However, effects on cognitive aspects of motor control have yet to be thoroughly investigated. If synchronization of movement to an auditory cue relies on a supramodal timing system involved in perceptual, motor, and sensorimotor integration, auditory cueing can be expected to affect both motor and perceptual timing. Here, we tested this hypothesis by assessing perceptual and motor timing in 15 IPD patients before and after a 4-week music training program with rhythmic auditory cueing. Long-term effects were assessed 1 month after the end of the training. Perceptual and motor timing was evaluated with a battery for the assessment of auditory sensorimotor and timing abilities and compared to that of age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls. Prior to training, IPD patients exhibited impaired perceptual and motor timing. Training improved patients' performance in tasks requiring synchronization with isochronous sequences, and enhanced their ability to adapt to durational changes in a sequence in hand tapping tasks. Benefits of cueing extended to time perception (duration discrimination and detection of misaligned beats in musical excerpts). The current results demonstrate that auditory cueing leads to benefits beyond gait and support the idea that coupling gait to rhythmic auditory cues in IPD patients relies on a neuronal network engaged in both perceptual and motor timing. © 2014 Benoit, Dalla Bella, Farrugia, Obrig, Mainka and Kotz.","adult; aged; article; association; auditory discrimination; auditory feedback; auditory stimulation; clinical article; controlled study; female; gait; human; male; motor control; motor performance; music therapy; Parkinson disease; perception; sensorimotor function","Auditory cueing; Motor behavior; Parkinson disease; Perception; Timing","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (238157)","Frontiers Media S.

A large number of empirical studies have been done upon first and second languages from different language families. However, few studies were carried out on the perception-production relation of Chinese English learners. Therefore, in the current study, under the theoretical framework of PAM-L1, 40 subjects with even numbers in two genders, who differ in language proficiency, are invited to participate in the perception experiment and the production experiment, in which discrimination, identification and pronunciation of /I/-/ϵ/, /ϵ/-/æ/, //-/Λ/ and /Λ/-// contrasts are observed. Results reveal that vowel perception of Chinese English learners is neither statistically correlated nor spectrally related to vowel production. Centroid spectral distances of production is not correlated to the correctness of discrimination, and the L2 perception range proves to manifest no significant relation to the L2 production range for Chinese EFL learners. PAM fails to explain the relation between vowel perception and production because the relation is of great complexity.

All the patients were aged 40 years or above, having left ventricular systolic dysfunction, belonging to NYHA class III and IV. Cox regression was used to model mortality considering age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium, anemia, platelets, creatinine phosphokinase, blood pressure, gender, diabetes and smoking status as potentially contributing for mortality. Kaplan Meier plot was used to study the general pattern of survival which showed high intensity of mortality in the initial days and then a gradual increase up to the end of study. Martingale residuals were used to assess functional form of variables. Results were validated computing calibration slope and discrimination ability of model via bootstrapping. For graphical prediction of survival probability, a nomogram was constructed. Age, renal dysfunction, blood pressure, ejection fraction and anemia were found as significant risk factors for mortality among heart failure patients. © 2017 Ahmad et al.

But while the Court famously invalidated several sex-based laws at the end of the twentieth century, it also issued many other, less-celebrated decisions that sanctioned sex-specific classifications in some circumstances. Examining these long-ignored cases that approved of sex discrimination, this Article explains how the Court’s rulings in this area have often rejected the principle of formal equality in favor of broader antisubordination concerns. Outlining a new model of equal protection that authorizes certain forms of sex discrimination, (Un)Equal Protection advocates for one particular discriminatory policy that could dramatically promote gender equality in the decades to come. Fatherhood bonuses— laws that give families additional parental leave when fathers stay at home with their newborns—have the potential to drastically reorder gendered divisions of labor and expand women’s workplace opportunities. Countries that have experimented with fatherhood bonuses have seen women with children spend more time in paid work, advance in their careers, and earn higher wages. Applying these international models to the American context, this Article explains why fatherhood bonuses would fit comfortably within our constitutional framework, which authorizes discriminatory policies when such policies support women’s public participation. (Un)Equal Protection concludes by proposing a model for fatherhood bonuses in the United States that would encourage more men to perform care work, thereby advancing the goal of gender equality for both sexes. © 2015 by Keith Cunningham-Parmeter.","","","","","","Northwestern University School of Law","","","","","","English","Northwest.

For encoding the gray level difference (GLD) between a reference pixel and its neighbors, local binary pattern employs a binary quantization which retains the sign of GLD but discards the magnitude information. To improve the discrimination capability, the proposed method utilizes both the sign and magnitude components by performing multi-level vector quantization of GLD. Each quantized level is then separately encoded to generate multiple local binary patterns. The proposed method is evaluated on four publicly available datasets (FERET, PAL, CASIA and FEI) through extensive experiments. Comparison of performance with various existing methods clearly demonstrated that the proposed method has advantages such as higher discrimination power, improved noise robustness and better generalization capability. © 2015","Feature extraction; Pattern recognition; Vector quantization; Binary quantization; Comparison of performance; Gender classification; Generalization capability; Gray Level Difference (GLD); Local binary patterns; Magnitude information; Reference pixels; Content based retrieval","Feature extraction; Gender classification; Local binary patterns; Pattern classification","","","Patel Institute of Technology, New Vallabh Vidyanagar, All India Council for Technical Education; Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, IITR, (784-20-79-428)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Comput Electr Eng","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It also explores whether gender comparison and perceived gender bias against women act as mediators in the above relationships. It aims to advance the understanding of the processes leading to individual's perception of gender discrimination in the Chinese workplace. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 362 workers via an employee survey in three large companies in China. The human resource staff helped us to distribute a self-administered questionnaire to the employees, and the authors assured them of confidentiality and protected their anonymity. To test the hypotheses, the authors employed structural equation modeling. The authors first conducted confirmatory factor analysis on the measurement model, and then the authors estimated three nested structural models to test the mediating hypotheses. Findings: The results reveal that gender and strength of gender identification are related to perceived gender discrimination. The authors further found that gender comparison and perceived gender bias against women partially mediated the relationship between gender and perceived gender discrimination, while gender comparison fully mediated the relationship between strength of gender identification and perceived gender discrimination. Practical implications: The study helps managers understand why and how their subordinates form perceptions of gender discrimination. Given the findings, they should be aware of the importance of gender identity, gender comparison, and gender bias in organizational practices in affecting such perceptions. Originality/value: This study is the first exploration of the complex relationships among gender, gender identification, gender comparison, perceived gender bias against women, and perceived gender discrimination. It shows the salient role of gender comparison and gender bias against women in shaping employees' perceptions of gender discrimination, apart from the direct effects of gender and strength of gender identification. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","","Chinese employees; Gender bias; Gender comparison; Gender identification; Perceived gender discrimination","","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","English","Equal.

This chapter explores why the United States passed only one of the conventions. It reviews the power, misinterpretation, and compliance theories that explain why only one of the treaties was ratified. In addition, it offers a fourth explanation of the nation's behavior - that of relative cost. Findings: This chapter shows that CEDAW's mandates, which are specific in nature, are costlier with respect to public services, educational resources, and programs to alleviate cultural prejudices, than are the more broadly framed ICERD mandates. This chapter finds this difference as a driving factor for the nation to enter into the race convention and not the women's rights pact. Methodologies: Methodologies used in this publication include feminist and legal analyses and the examination of US policies as well as statements made by political figures. Originality: This chapter makes contributions to legal and feminist scholarship by providing insight into the nation's adoption of ICERD, and its failure to ratify CEDAW despite its stance that it is a supporter of women's rights. The implications of this study are that while the power, misinterpretation, and compliance theories are useful to understand the apparent discrepant response to the two treaties, relative cost as defined by the different ways in which the treaties are framed is also useful in explaining the United States' failure to ratify the gender equality treaty. Though CEDAW is more specific in its identification of equality issues and is costlier than ICERD, the advancement of both gender and racial equality in the United States falls short of international standards.

This was a landmark step in adapting the 1955 Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners to women offenders and prisoners, and was an important precursor for the revision of the 1955 rules themselves. As ‘soft law’, they are human rights principles that recognize that female prisoners have different needs from male prisoners. They take into account, among others, the presence of high levels of victimization among women prisoners and their greater propensity for self-harm and suicide; the special status of some women prisoners as mothers of children; the particular health and hygiene concerns of women; the stigma and discrimination facing women prisoners; the need for gender-responsive programs and activities for women in prison; and the particular needs of indigenous women prisoners and those from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds. They call for gender-responsive and gender-sensitive policies and programs in prison in a wide variety of areas: intake, classification, mental and physical healthcare, mothering in prison, searches, and the development of pre-and post-release programs that take into account the stigmatization and discrimination that women face upon release from prison, among others. We will explore the history and background of these rules, offer a critique, and discuss their implications for feminist criminological interventions related to women in prison around the world. © 2017, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to observe whether visually impaired subjects develop superior abilities in olfactory perception to compensate for their lack of vision. We investigated the odor perception of visually impaired individuals aged 7 to 89 (n = 99; 52 women, 47 men) and compared them with subjects of a control group aged 8 to 82 years (n = 100; 45 women, 55 men) without any visual impairment. The participants were evaluated by Sniffin’ Sticks odor identification and discrimination test. Identification ability was assessed for 16 common odors presented in felt-tip pens. In the odor discrimination task, subjects had to determine which of three pens in 16 triplets had a different odor. The median number of correctly identified odorant pens in both groups was the same, 13 of the offered 16. In the discrimination test, there was also no significant difference observed. Gender did not influence results. Age-related changes were observed in both groups with olfactory perception decreasing after the age of 51.

It was expected that racial discrimination would predict poorer perceptions of the EVE among Latina/o adolescents. Ethnic identity was hypothesized to buffer the negative effect of racial discrimination on Latina/o students’ EVE. The participants in this study were 396 urban, low-income Latina/o high school students from a large, Midwestern city who completed surveys in both 9th- and 10th-grade. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships among racial discrimination, ethnic identity, and EVE. Results supported a protective model of resilience. Specifically, ethnic identity served as a protective factor by buffering the negative effect of perceived racial discrimination on EVE for male participants. The present study is the first to examine ethnic identity as a buffer of racial discrimination on EVE among Latina/o high school students.

However, it is challenging to capture the nuances of sexual identity with traditional survey research methods. Using a mixed-methods approach, we gathered data on the sexual identities of 80 behaviorally bisexual women in the Midwestern United States through an online survey. When provided different types of measures (e.g., open ended and fixed response) and different contexts in which to identify (e.g., private and public), participants varied in how they reported their sexual identities. Qualitative analysis of participant narratives around identity change finds partitioning and ranking of attraction is a key component in understanding behaviorally bisexual women’s identities. We further identify a division regarding the desired outcomes of identity development processes. Given the multiple ways in which participants identified depending upon the type of measure and the context specified, and the variation in identification over time, results support reconsidering the capability of typical measures and methods used in survey research to capture sexual identity information. Additionally, findings highlight the utility of including multiple, context-specific measures of sexual identities in future research. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adult; Bisexuality; Female; Humans; Midwestern United States; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior; Social Identification; Surveys and Questionnaires; bisexual female; female; gender identity; human; major clinical study; narrative; qualitative analysis; United States; women who have sex with women; adult; bisexuality; psychology; questionnaire; sexual and gender minority; sexual behavior; social behavior; United States","Bisexual women; Bisexuality; Identities; Sexual identity; Sexual orientation; Women who have sex with women","","","American Sexually Transmitted Disease Association","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Arch.

Markers for the development of psychosis have been studied, to optimize the detection of people at risk of psychosis. One possible marker for the transition to psychosis is social cognition. To estimate effect sizes for social cognition based on a quantitative integration of the published evidence, we conducted a meta-analysis of social cognitive performance in people at ultra high risk (UHR). Methods A literature search (1970-July 2015) was performed in PubMed, PsychINFO, Medline, Embase, and ISI Web of Science, using the search terms 'social cognition', 'theory of mind', 'emotion recognition', 'attributional style', 'social knowledge', 'social perception', 'empathy', 'at risk mental state', 'clinical high risk', 'psychosis prodrome', and 'ultra high risk'. The pooled effect size (Cohen's D) and the effect sizes for each domain of social cognition were calculated. A random effects model with 95% confidence intervals was used. Results Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. The overall significant effect was of medium magnitude (d = 0.52, 95% Cl = 0.38-0.65). No moderator effects were found for age, gender and sample size. Sub-analyses demonstrated that individuals in the UHR phase show significant moderate deficits in affect recognition and affect discrimination in faces as well as in voices and in verbal Theory of Mind (TOM). Due to an insufficient amount of studies, we did not calculate an effect size for attributional bias and social perception/ knowledge. A majority of studies did not find a correlation between social cognition deficits and transition to psychosis, which may suggest that social cognition in general is not a useful marker for the development of psychosis. However some studies suggest the possible predictive value of verbal TOM and the recognition of specific emotions in faces for the transition into psychosis. More research is needed on these subjects. Conclusion The published literature indicates consistent general impairments in social cognition in people in the UHR phase, but only very specific impairments seem to predict transition to psychosis.  © 2015 van Donkersgoed et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Cognition; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychotic Disorders; Social Behavior; Theory of Mind; age; anger; Article; attributional bias; empathy; facial expression; fear; gender; high risk population; human; intelligence quotient; perceptive discrimination; predictive value; psychosis; recognition; social cognition; theory of mind; cognition; meta analysis; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; psychology; psychosis; social behavior","","","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Early detection of depression requires a patient-friendly inexpensive method based on easily measurable objective indicators. This study aims to compare various single-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) measures in application for detection of depression. Methods The EEG recordings were performed on a group of 13 medication-free depressive outpatients and 13 gender and age matched controls. The recorded 30-channel EEG signal was analysed using linear methods spectral asymmetry index, alpha power variability and relative gamma power and nonlinear methods Higuchi's fractal dimension, detrended fluctuation analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity. Classification accuracy between depressive and control subjects was calculated using logistic regression analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation. Calculations were performed separately for each EEG channel. Results All calculated measures indicated increase with depression. Maximal testing accuracy using a single measure was 81% for linear and 77% for nonlinear measures. Combination of two linear measures provides the accuracy of 88% and two nonlinear measures of 85%. Maximal classification accuracy of 92% was indicated using mixed combination of three linear and three nonlinear measures. Conclusions The results of this preliminary study confirm that single-channel EEG analysis, employing the combination of measures, can provide discrimination of depression at the level of multichannel EEG analysis. The performed study shows that there is no single superior measure for detection of depression. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Depression; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nonlinear Dynamics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Electroencephalography; Fractal dimension; Nonlinear analysis; Regression analysis; Signal analysis; Depression; Non-linear signal processing; Power variability; Relative gamma power; Spectral asymmetry index; adult; aged; algorithm; alpha rhythm; Article; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; depression; detrended fluctuation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; female; gamma rhythm; Higuchi fractal diemnsion; human; Lempel Ziv complexity; linear system; logistic regression analysis; male; nonlinear system; outpatient; classification; comparative study; depression; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; Biomedical signal processing","Alpha power variability; Depression; EEG; Nonlinear signal processing; Relative gamma power; Spectral asymmetry index","","","European Commission, EC; Haridus- ja Teadusministeerium, HM, (IUT 19 - 2); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","English","Comput.

Different faces, even of the same gender, convey different magnitude of sexual dimorphism. However, in gender classification, gender has been interpreted discretely as either male or female. The exact magnitude of the sexual dimorphism in each gender is ignored. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the SD magnitude, using the ratio of votes from the Random Forest algorithm performed on 3D geometric features related to the face morphology. Then, faces are separated into a Low-SD group and a High-SD group. In the Intra-group experiments, when the training is performed with scans of similar SD magnitude than the testing scan, the classification accuracy improves. In Inter-group experiments, the scans with low magnitude of SD demonstrate higher gender discrimination power than the ones with high SD magnitude. With a decision-level fusion method, our method achieves 97.46% gender classification rate on the 466 earliest 3D scans of FRGCv2 (mainly neutral), and 97.18% on the whole FRGCv2 dataset (with expressions). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Classification (of information); Computer vision; Decision trees; Distributed computer systems; 3D faces; Classification accuracy; Decision level fusion; Gender classification; Gender discrimination; Random fores; Random forest algorithm; Sexual dimorphism; Social sciences","3D face; Gender classification; Random fores; Sexual dimorphism","","","","Springer Verlag","13th European Conference on Computer Vision, ECCV 2014","115869","Zurich","6 September 2014 through 12 September 2014","Adobe; amazon; Ascending Technologies; BOSCH; Disney Research; facebook; Google; IJAC; iniLabs; Leica; M Tec; Microsoft Research; MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC; mOBILEYE; NICTA; nVIDIA; OmROn; Pelican imaging; QUALCOMM; SIEMENS; SUPERFISH; technicolor; The University of Adelaide; The University of North Carolina; TOSHIBA; Toyota; VIZrt","English","Lect.

This article demonstrates that conventional decompositions, no matter whether linear or nonparametric, are equivalent to assuming a (probably too) simple model of mediation (aimed at assessing causal mechanisms) and may therefore lack causal interpretability. The reason is that decompositions typically control for post-birth variables that lie on the causal pathway from gender/ethnicity (which are determined at or even before birth) to wage but neglect potential endogeneity that may arise from this approach. Based on the newer literature on mediation analysis, we therefore provide more attractive identifying assumptions and discuss nonparametric identification based on reweighting. © 2015, American Statistical Association.","","Causal mechanisms; Mediation; Wage decomposition","","","","American Statistical Association","","","","","","English","J.

The aim of this study was to identify students' perceptions of factors that affect the dental school environment and to test differences in their experiences in terms of gender and year. This picture of the existing environment was meant to serve as a first step toward creating and supporting a more humanistic academic environment. A mixed-methods approach was used for data collection during the 2009-10 and 2010- 11 academic years at one U.S. dental school. Four focus groups were first conducted to explore challenges and conflicts faced by students during their dental education. A written survey informed by the focus group results was then used to obtain quantitative data. The survey response rate was 47 percent (N=188). Faculty inconsistency, cheating, and belittlement/disrespect were experienced by many of the responding dental students during their education, similar to what has been documented in medicine. These students also reported experiencing both constructive communication (90 percent) and destructive communication (up to 32 percent). The female students reported more gender discrimination and sexual harassment than their male peers, and the clinical students reported more experience with belittlement and destructive communication than the preclinical students. The results suggest that greater effort should be directed toward creating a more humanistic environment in dental schools.

Extending research on those targeted by sexism, the current study explored the collateral damage of ambient sexism on bystanders observing sexism directed at others. An experiment with 218 U.S. undergraduates at a large West-coast public university assessed how ambient sexism directed at a female job applicant impacted male and female bystanders’ self-esteem and career aspirations. Results generally supported theoretical predictions regarding the moderating impact of bystander gender on the relationship between ambient sexism and bystander well-being. As hypothesized, ambient hostile sexism more negatively impacted female bystanders than male bystanders with regard to performance-based state self-esteem. Performance-based self-esteem in turn predicted career aspirations such that lower performance-based state self-esteem predicted lower career aspirations: gender moderated this mediated relationship such that the indirect effect was more negative for female bystanders than male bystanders. Gender also moderated the relationship between ambient benevolent sexism and appearance-based state self-esteem. Women observing benevolent sexism tended to report enhanced appearance-based esteem relative to women in the hostile sexism and control conditions, whereas men observing benevolent sexism reported significantly lower appearance esteem than men in the hostile sexism and control conditions. In sum, the current study suggests that women and men bystanders are impacted differently by ambient benevolent and hostile sexism. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","","Ambient sexism; Ambivalent sexism; Benevolent sexism; Bystander effects; Gender discrimination; Well-being","","","","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this study, 2 trauma proliferation pathways were identified that utilize a developmentally based trauma framework (DBTF). Data previously collected from 6 different cultural groups (N = 2279; 2 mental health clinics in Egypt and the United States, Native Americans, Palestinian adults in Gaza, and college students in Poland and Egypt) were reanalyzed. The 6 studies utilized DBTF-based measures of cumulative trauma and trauma types. Path analysis was used to test the trauma proliferation model and PROCESS software was used to identify mediators and their effect sizes. Results of the analyses indicated that attachment trauma and collective identity trauma independently predicted (directly and through mediators) personal identity trauma, role identity trauma, secondary trauma, and survival trauma.

The current study sought to examine the multiplicities of femme identity by exploring who identifies as femme and whether femme-identified individuals experience in-group discrimination as a function of their femme identity (i.e., femme-negativity). Femme-identified individuals in the study were diverse with respect to both gender and sexual identity, and queer identification was highlighted as an important element of femme identity. Many of the femme-identified individuals reported experiences of femme-negativity and femme-related stigma consciousness.

It has turned away people of color who protest systems such as racialized mass incarceration because their oppression does not take the form of a “racial classification.” It has diluted the protections of intermediate scrutiny in gender discrimination and abortion cases. And it has turned its back on groups who once benefitted from “animus” review, including people with disabilities and poor people. Meanwhile, the only site of vitality in equal protection jurisprudence is the claims of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. Yet the Court, writing opinions that are rarely in conversation with one another, has made no effort to justify this growing divide. I call attention to this reordered equal protection landscape, which contrasts sharply with the conventional understanding of equal protection tiers of scrutiny. Specifically, I identify three manifestations of LGBT exceptionalism, advantages that LGBT people (especially gays and lesbians) enjoy compared to virtually every other civil rights constituency: (1) the Court has rigidly used the concept of a “classification” as a gatekeeping device, but it has ignored this requirement in sexual orientation cases; (2) LGBT people can invoke animus, a standard that emerged from cases brought by people of color, poor people, and people with disabilities but that the Court no longer recognizes in such cases; and (3) sexual orientation cases leave open important questions, including the legal standard that would apply to remedial policies based on sexual orientation—quite unlike the Court’s adverse resolution of these questions in race cases. The Supreme Court’s recent Obergefell decision unveiled a uniquely capacious conception of animus, which indicates that sexual orientation is moving even further away from race and gender. These findings suggest that law professors and legal scholars reconsider how they teach and write about equal protection. © 2016, Stanford Law School.

Their role in forensics as a legally admissible tool of identification is well recognized and is based on their stability following full development, individualistic characteristics, easy classification of their patterns, and uniqueness. Nevertheless, fingerprint ridge density and its variability have not been previously studied in the Sudanese population. Hence, this study was conducted to analyze the topological variability in epidermal ridge density and to assess the possibility of its application in determining sex of Sudanese Arabs. The data used for this study were prints of all 10 fingers of 200 Sudanese Arab individuals (100 men and 100 women) aged between 18 and 28 years. Fingerprint ridge density was assessed for three different areas (radial, ulnar and proximal) for all 10 fingers of each subject. Significant variability was found between the areas (p < 0.01). Women showed significantly higher ridge density in the three areas for all and each fingers. Men and women showed similar patterns of densities with distal areas being denser than proximal ones. Side asymmetry was more evident in distal areas. Ridge density thresholds for discrimination of sexes were developed. Hence, fingerprints found in forensic examinations/crime scenes can be useful to determine sex of Sudanese individuals based on fingerprint ridge density; furthermore, ridge density can be considered a morphological trait for individual variation in forensic anthropology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Despite this, health disparities research in Latin America tends to focus on gender, class and regional health differences while downplaying ethnoracial differences. Few scholars have conducted studies of ethnoracial identification and health disparities in Latin America. Research that examines multiple measures of ethnoracial identification is rarer still. Official data on race/ethnicity in Latin America are based on self-identification which can differ from interviewer-ascribed or phenotypic classification based on skin color. We use data from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru to examine associations of interviewer-ascribed skin color, interviewer-ascribed race/ethnicity, and self-reported race/ethnicity with self-rated health among Latin American adults (ages 18-65). We also examine associations of observer-ascribed skin color with three additional correlates of health - skin color discrimination, class discrimination, and socio-economic status. We find a significant gradient in self-rated health by skin color. Those with darker skin colors report poorer health. Darker skin color influences self-rated health primarily by increasing exposure to class discrimination and low socio-economic status. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Racism; Self Report; Skin; Socioeconomic Factors; South America; Young Adult; Latin America; Brazil; Colombia; Mexico [North America]; Peru; color; ethnicity; health geography; health status; phenotype; racial identity; self assessment; skin; socioeconomic status; class; gender relations; Latino people; race; adult; aged; article; Brazil; Colombia; data analysis; ethnic group; ethnicity; female; human; information processing; Latin American; male; Mexico; Peru; race difference; racism; self concept; self report; skin color; social adaptation; social behavior; social status; South and Central America; adolescent; health care delivery; health disparity; middle aged; psychology; racism; self report; skin; socioeconomics; South America; young adult; age distribution; Article; controlled study; educational status; ethnic difference; health care access; health care quality; health care utilization; health service; health status; race difference; sex difference; skin color; South and Central America","Discrimination; Latin America; Latino; Race/ethnicity; Self-rated health; Skin color; Socio-economic status (SES)","","","Ford Foundation; Princeton University, Princeton; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2CHD047879, R24HD050924)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","English","Soc.

In our study, faculty members received e-mails from fictional prospective doctoral students seeking to schedule a meeting either that day or in 1 week; students' names signaled their race (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Indian, or Chinese) and gender. When the requests were to meet in 1 week, Caucasian males were granted access to faculty members 26% more often than were women and minorities; also, compared with women and minorities, Caucasian males received more and faster responses. However, these patterns were essentially eliminated when prospective students requested a meeting that same day. Our identification of a temporal discrimination effect is consistent with the predictions of construal-level theory and implies that subtle contextual shifts can alter patterns of race- and gender-based discrimination. © The Author(s) 2012.","","decision making; discrimination; minority groups; prejudice; racial and ethnic attitudes and relations","","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","English","Psychol.

Methods: Discriminatory experiences in eight social situations were assessed using the 7 th wave of Korean Labor and Income Panel Study. After restricting the study population to waged workers, a logistic regression model was constructed to predict the probability that an individual has experienced discrimination based on the observed covariates for each of eight situations, using the data of participants who answered either Yes or No. With the model fit, the predicted logit score of discrimination (PLSD) was obtained for participants who answered Not Applicable (NA), as well as for those who answered Yes or No. The mean PLSD of the NA group was compared with those of the Yes group and the No group after stratification by gender and education level using an ANOVA model. Results: On the questions of discrimination in getting hired and receiving income, the PLSD of the NA group was significantly higher than that of the No group and was not different from that of Yes group for female and junior high or less educated workers, suggesting that their NA responses were more likely to mean that they have experienced discrimination. For male and college or more educated workers, the NA group had a PLSD similar to that for the No group and had a significantly higher PLSD than the Yes group, implying that their NA responses would mean they that they have not experienced discrimination. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the responses of NA on the discrimination questionnaire may need different interpretation based on the respondents' gender and education level in South Korea. © 2012 Kim et al.","Analysis of Variance; Educational Status; Employment; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Prejudice; Questionnaires; Republic of Korea; Self Disclosure; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; adolescent; adult; aged; analysis of variance; article; educational status; employment status; female; female worker; human; logistic regression analysis; male; personal experience; population research; predicted logit score of discrimination; prediction; prevalence; probability; questionnaire; social discrimination; social interaction; South Korea; statistical model; stratified sample; educational status; employment; self disclosure; sex difference; social psychology; socioeconomics; South Korea","","","","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

It aims to use home health aide work as an example of how US labor laws and court decisions create and support disadvantages for workers who are largely economically-disadvantaged and often women of color. Design/methodology/approach - The article considers processes of inequality based on demographic characteristics and the resulting stereotyping, discrimination, and gender, race, and class inequalities. Findings - The article finds that multiple intersecting processes of inequality exist in organizations, manifested in practices of stereotyping and discrimination for some job applicants and workers and advantageous positioning for certain others. Research limitations/implications - Future research should more specifically consider the effects of multiple processes of inequality on individuals' organizational experiences and the intersections of gender, race, and class (as well as other markers such as ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability) in organizational practices. Practical implications - Managers and human resources practitioners should be aware of the effects of processes related to the intersectionality of gender, race, and class and work to eliminate resulting stereotyping and other discriminatory organizational practices linked to these processes in their organizations. Social implications - Identification of processes of inequality resulting in stereotyping and discrimination may help reduce them, thus increasing opportunities for work, wages, and benefits, and reducing poverty for members of the most devalued groups.

Gender recognition provides a further opportunity to more fully examine this issue as this ability may be intact in DPs and it has been shown to depend on processing configural information and holistic processing in neurotypical individuals. In the present study we first determined that, indeed, gender discrimination performance was similar in DPs and controls. Second, we found that inversion and scrambling (which we propose measures holistic processing and sensitivity to configural information, respectively) produced comparable deficits in DPs and controls, suggesting that both groups use holistic processing and configural information to recognize gender. This indicates that holistic processing and using configural face information are not general impairments in DP and may be more specific to face identity. © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press Ltd.","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; developmental prosopagnosia; face; female; gender; human; male; priority journal; prosopagnosia; recognition","Developmental prosopagnosia; Face inversion; Gender recognition; Holistic processing","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 EY13602)","","","","","","","English","Vis.

Study 2 found that responses to male names depicted in larger font were faster than male names depicted in smaller font, whereas opposite response patterns were given for female names.

However, the brain basis of accent processing and the effects of neurodegenerative disease on this processing are not well understood. Here we undertook a detailed neuropsychological study of a patient, AA with progressive nonfluent aphasia, in whom agnosia for accents was a prominent clinical feature. We designed a battery to assess AA's ability to process accents in relation to other complex auditory signals. AA's performance was compared with a cohort of 12 healthy age and gender matched control participants and with a second patient, PA, who had semantic dementia with phonagnosia and prosopagnosia but no reported difficulties with accent processing. Relative to healthy controls, the patients showed distinct profiles of accent agnosia. AA showed markedly impaired ability to distinguish change in an individual's accent despite being able to discriminate phonemes and voices (apperceptive accent agnosia); and in addition, a severe deficit of accent identification. In contrast, PA was able to perceive changes in accents, phonemes and voices normally, but showed a relatively mild deficit of accent identification (associative accent agnosia). Both patients showed deficits of voice and environmental sound identification, however PA showed an additional deficit of face identification whereas AA was able to identify (though not name) faces normally. These profiles suggest that AA has conjoint (or interacting) deficits involving both apperceptive and semantic processing of accents, while PA has a primary semantic (associative) deficit affecting accents along with other kinds of auditory objects and extending beyond the auditory modality. Brain MRI revealed left peri-Sylvian atrophy in case AA and relatively focal asymmetric (predominantly right sided) temporal lobe atrophy in case PA. These cases provide further evidence for the fractionation of brain mechanisms for complex sound analysis, and for the stratification of progressive aphasia syndromes according to the signature of nonverbal auditory deficits they produce. © 2013 The Authors.","Agnosia; Aphasia; Auditory Perception; Female; Frontotemporal Dementia; Humans; Middle Aged; Recognition (Psychology); Semantics; Speech; Accent processing; Dementia; Phonagnosia; Primary progressive aphasia; Prosopagnosia; accent processing; adult; aged; agnosia; apperceptive accent agnosia; article; associative accent agnosia; auditory discrimination; brain atrophy; brain function; case report; clinical feature; controlled study; disease severity; face profile; human; language processing; male; mental performance; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phonagnosia; phoneme; primary progressive aphasia; progressive nonfluent aphasia; prosopagnosia; semantic dementia; sound analysis; sound detection; speech discrimination; suprasylvian gyrus; temporal lobe; visual discrimination","Accent processing; Dementia; Phonagnosia; Primary progressive aphasia; Prosopagnosia","","","Department of Health's NIHR Biomedical Research Centres; UK Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust, WT; Medical Research Council, MRC, (G0801306); Mauritius Research Council, MRC, (091673/Z/10/Z)","","","","","","","English","Neuropsychologia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The use of microRNAs (miRNAs) as minimally-invasive biomarkers has opened new opportunities for the diagnosis of cancer, primarily because they exhibit tumor-specific expression profiles and have been commonly observed in blood of both cancer patients and healthy controls. The aim of this pilot study was to identify miRNAs in the cellular fraction of human peripheral blood as potential novel biomarkers for the detection of malignant mesothelioma. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using oligonucleotide microarrays for biomarker identification the miRNA levels in the cellular fraction of human peripheral blood of mesothelioma patients and asbestos-exposed controls were analyzed. Using a threefold expression change in combination with a significance level of p&0.05, miR-103 was identified as a potential biomarker for malignant mesothelioma. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used for validation of miR-103 in 23 malignant mesothelioma patients, 17 asbestos-exposed controls, and 25 controls from the general population. For discrimination of mesothelioma patients from asbestos-exposed controls a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 71% were calculated, and for discrimination of mesothelioma patients from the general population a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 76%. Conclusions/Significance: The results of this pilot study show that miR-103 is characterized by a promising sensitivity and specificity and might be a potential minimally-invasive biomarker for the diagnosis of mesothelioma. In addition, our results support the concept of using the cellular fraction of human blood for biomarker discovery. However, for early detection of malignant mesothelioma the feasibility of miR-103 alone or in combination with other biomarkers needs to be analyzed in a prospective study. © 2012 Weber et al.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asbestos; Blood Cells; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mesothelioma; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; ROC Curve; Tumor Markers, Biological; asbestos; microRNA; microRNA 103; microRNA 20a; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIRN103 microRNA, human; MIRN20 microRNA, human; tumor marker; adult; age; aged; article; asbestos exposure; biphasic mesothelioma; blood analysis; cancer classification; cell fractionation; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; epithelioid mesothelioma; exposure; female; gender; human; human cell; male; malignant mesothelioma; microarray analysis; minimally invasive procedure; oligonucleotide microarray; pilot study; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; smoking; blood; blood cell; case control study; gene expression regulation; genetics; mesothelioma; metabolism; middle aged","","","asbestos, 1332-21-4; Asbestos, 1332-21-4; MIRN103 microRNA, human, ; MIRN20 microRNA, human, ; MicroRNAs, ; Tumor Markers, Biological, ","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Fewer studies, however, have focused specifically on abnormal processing of neutral faces despite evidence that depressed patients are slow and less accurate at recognizing neutral expressions in comparison with healthy controls. The current study aimed to investigate whether this misclassification described behaviourally for neutral faces also occurred when classifying patterns of brain activation to neutral faces for these patients. Methods: Two independent depressed samples: (1) Nineteen medication-free patients with depression and 19 healthy volunteers and (2) Eighteen depressed individuals and 18 age and gender-ratio-matched healthy volunteers viewed emotional faces (sad/neutral; happy/neutral) during an fMRI experiment. We used a new pattern recognition framework: first, we trained the classifier to discriminate between two brain states (e.g. viewing happy faces vs. viewing neutral faces) using data only from healthy controls (HC). Second, we tested the classifier using patterns of brain activation of a patient and a healthy control for the same stimuli. Finally, we tested if the classifier's predictions (predictive probabilities) for emotional and neutral face classification were different for healthy controls and depressed patients. Results: Predictive probabilities to patterns of brain activation to neutral faces in both groups of patients were significantly lower in comparison to the healthy controls. This difference was specific to neutral faces. There were no significant differences in predictive probabilities to patterns of brain activation to sad faces (sample 1) and happy faces (samples 2) between depressed patients and healthy controls. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the pattern of brain activation to neutral faces in depressed patients is not consistent with the pattern observed in healthy controls subject to the same stimuli. This difference in brain activation might underlie the behavioural misinterpretation of the neutral faces content by the depressed patients. © 2013 Oliveira et al.","Adolescent; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Face; Facial Expression; Female; Grief; Happiness; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Psychotropic Drugs; accuracy; adult; article; brain function; classifier; clinical article; controlled study; evidence based medicine; face profile; facial expression; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Gaussian process classifier; human; major depression; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; pattern recognition; predictive value; task performance; visual discrimination","","","Psychotropic Drugs, ","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K01MH083001, R01MH073801, R01MH073953, R01MH076971)","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. The goal of fairness-aware classifiers is to classify data while taking into account the potential issues of fairness, discrimination, neutrality, and/or independence. In this paper, after reviewing fairness-aware classification methods, we focus on one such method, Calders and Verwer's two-naive-Bayes method. This method has been shown superior to the other classifiers in terms of fairness, which is formalized as the statistical independence between a class and a sensitive feature. However, the cause of the superiority is unclear, because it utilizes a somewhat heuristic post-processing technique rather than an explicitly formalized model. We clarify the cause by comparing this method with an alternative naive Bayes classifier, which is modified by a modeling technique called 'hypothetical fair-factorization.' This investigation reveals the theoretical background of the two-naive-Bayes method and its connections with other methods. Based on these findings, we develop another naive Bayes method with an 'actual fair-factorization technique' and empirically show that this new method can achieve an equal level of fairness as that of the two-naive-Bayes classifier. © 2013 IEEE.","Classifiers; Data privacy; Factorization; Classification methods; Data mining technology; Modeling technique; Naive bayes; Naive Bayes classifiers; Post-processing techniques; Statistical independence; Statistical prediction; Data mining","Discrimination-aware data mining; Fairness-aware data mining; Naive Bayes; Privacy","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (23240043, 24500194)","IEEE Computer Society","2013 13th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2013","104247","Dallas, TX","7 December 2013 through 10 December 2013","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Twenty-one MtF transgender veterans and 9 cis-gender females were enrolled. The interaction of speaking fundamental frequency (SFo) and formant (resonatory) frequencies in gender discrimination was investigated. The results indicated that an average SFo above 180 Hz and maintaining a speaking pitch range of approximately 140 to 300 Hz appear to be the most powerful acoustic features or markers in the perception of a female voice in a biological male (M. L. Brown & Rounsley, 1996). An SFo of approximately 170 Hz appears to be the lower limit that would result in a biological male being perceived as having a female voice by most listeners. A slight elevation in the second (F2) and third (F3) formants was noted but does not appear to have a significant influence in the perception of a female voice in biological males. Female voices appear to be perceived as male by most listeners if average SFo is at or below 165 Hz, the low SFo is below 130 Hz, and a low F3 is exhibited. No evidence was found that jitter (frequency perturbation) and shimmer (amplitude perturbation) affect the perception of a female or male voice in a biological male. The results support previous research that elevated pitch is the strongest acoustic marker in the perception of a female voice in biological males. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","formant; frequency; intonation; resonance; Transgender","","","","","","","","","","English","Int.

In previous studies, the usefulness of these genetic markers for prediction of diabetes was found to be limited. However, differences may exist between substrata of the population according to the presence of major diabetes risk factors. This study aimed to investigate the added predictive value of genetic information (42 single nucleotide polymorphisms) in subgroups of sex, age, family history of diabetes, and obesity.Methods:A case-cohort study (random subcohort N = 1,968; incident cases: N = 578) within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Potsdam study was used. Prediction models without and with genetic information were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the integrated discrimination improvement. Stratified analyses included subgroups of sex, age (<50 or ≥50 years), family history (positive if either father or mother or a sibling has/had diabetes), and obesity (BMI< or ≥30 kg/m2).Results:A genetic risk score did not improve prediction above classic and metabolic markers, but - compared to a non-invasive prediction model - genetic information slightly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (difference [95%-CI]: 0.007 [0.002-0.011]). Stratified analyses showed stronger improvement in the older age group (0.010 [0.002-0.018]), the group with a positive family history (0.012 [0.000-0.023]) and among obese participants (0.015 [-0.005-0.034]) compared to the younger participants (0.005 [-0.004-0.014]), participants with a negative family history (0.003 [-0.001-0.008]) and non-obese (0.007 [0.000-0.014]), respectively. No difference was found between men and women.Conclusion:There was no incremental value of genetic information compared to standard non-invasive and metabolic markers. Our study suggests that inclusion of genetic variants in diabetes risk prediction might be useful for subgroups with already manifest risk factors such as older age, a positive family history and obesity. © 2013 Mühlenbruch et al.","Adult; Age Factors; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Sex Factors; adult; age; article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; family history; female; gender; genetic risk; genetics; human; major clinical study; male; obesity; prediction; predictive value; risk assessment; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism","","","Genetic Markers, ","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

It remains unclear whether and how CHD risk prediction might be improved among older adults. We aimed to compare the prognostic performance of the Framingham risk score (FRS), directly and after recalibration, with refit functions derived from the present cohort, as well as to assess the utility of adding other routinely available risk parameters to FRS. Methods: Among 2193 black and white older adults (mean age, 73.5 years) without pre-existing cardiovascular disease from the Health ABC cohort, we examined adjudicated CHD events, defined as incident myocardial infarction, CHD death, and hospitalization for angina or coronary revascularization. Results: During 8-year follow-up, 351 participants experienced CHD events. The FRS poorly discriminated between persons who experienced CHD events vs. not (C-index: 0.577 in women; 0.583 in men) and underestimated absolute risk prediction by 51% in women and 8% in men. Recalibration of the FRS improved absolute risk prediction, particulary for women. For both genders, refitting these functions substantially improved absolute risk prediction, with similar discrimination to the FRS. Results did not differ between whites and blacks. The addition of lifestyle variables, waist circumference and creatinine did not improve risk prediction beyond risk factors of the FRS. Conclusions: The FRS underestimates CHD risk in older adults, particularly in women, although traditional risk factors remain the best predictors of CHD. Re-estimated risk functions using these factors improve accurate estimation of absolute risk. © 2012 Rodondi et al.","African Americans; Aged; Blood Pressure; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, HDL; Cohort Studies; Coronary Disease; Diabetes Complications; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Smoking; Angina; creatinine; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; age distribution; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery recanalization; female; follow up; Framingham risk score; heart death; heart infarction; human; human experiment; incidence; ischemic heart disease; lifestyle; male; prediction; prognosis; risk assessment; sex difference; waist circumference; African American; blood; blood pressure; Caucasian; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; predictive value; risk factor; smoking","","","creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, HDL, ","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (ZIAAG000015); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (K24AR051895)","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

It is unclear, however, whether these groups can be differentiated at single-subject level, for instance using the machine learning analysis support vector machine (SVM). Here, we used a multimodal approach to examine the ability of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor neuroimaging (DTI), genetic and cognitive data to differentiate between UHR, FEP and HC subjects at the single-subject level using SVM. Method Three age- and gender-matched SVM paired comparison groups were created comprising 19, 19 and 15 subject pairs for FEP versus HC, UHR versus HC and FEP versus UHR, respectively. Genetic, sMRI, DTI, fMRI and cognitive data were obtained for each participant and the ability of each to discriminate subjects at the individual level in conjunction with SVM was tested. Results Successful classification accuracies (p < 0.05) comprised FEP versus HC (genotype, 67.86%; DTI, 65.79%; fMRI, 65.79% and 68.42%; cognitive data, 73.69%), UHR versus HC (sMRI, 68.42%; DTI, 65.79%), and FEP versus UHR (sMRI, 76.67%; fMRI, 73.33%; cognitive data, 66.67%). Conclusions The results suggest that FEP subjects are identifiable at the individual level using a range of biological and cognitive measures. Comparatively, only sMRI and DTI allowed discrimination of UHR from HC subjects. For the first time FEP and UHR subjects have been shown to be directly differentiable at the single-subject level using cognitive, sMRI and fMRI data. Preliminarily, the results support clinical development of SVM to help inform identification of FEP and UHR subjects, though future work is needed to provide enhanced levels of accuracy. © Cambridge University Press 2013.","Adult; Brain; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Genotype; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Multimodal Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychotic Disorders; Risk; Sensitivity and Specificity; Support Vector Machines; Time Factors; Young Adult; adult; article; brain; comparative study; diffusion tensor imaging; equipment; female; functional neuroimaging; genetics; genotype; human; male; methodology; multimodal imaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; psychosis; risk; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; time; young adult","Cognitive measures; first-episode psychosis; genetic information; magnetic resonance imaging; support vector machines; ultra-high-risk psychosis","","","","","","","","","","English","Psychol.

The article concentrates on levels of resistance as a part of Afghan female's lifestyle against the gender oppression that are enforced on them through their lifestyle and culture, the objectives of their community and its standards. The novel is selected for the discussion of this problem as it shows the conflicts experienced by Afghan females in regards to their positions and roles in their community and to find a unique identification as an individual. Findings on the conflicts of females and the level of resistance factors are seen in the novel though the analysis of the two primary characters in the novel Maryam and Laila, as the reflection of the truth of Afghan female's lifestyle. The framework for the article is designed by using Stephen Selmon’s, Edward Said’s and Benita Parry’s theories of level of resistance in the perspective of post-colonial and feminist literary discussion.

I was struck by the juxtaposition: was there a relationship between the leaky pipeline and this constant push to greater levels of distinction? Penn is by no means the only university to suffer the leaky pipeline: it is a national, even international problem.2 I will take Penn as an example, however, of how this plays out in the Ivy League. The university’s “Progress Report on Gender Equity” found that women made up 28 per cent of all faculty.3 How this plays out across rank is striking: women made up 42 per cent of assistant professors, 30 per cent of associate professors, and only 18 per cent of full professors. This is not a case of more women coming up through the ranks, because the proportion of standing women faculty had increased by only 4 per cent since 1999. The leaky pipe for racial minorities is as dramatic. The “Progress Report on Minority Equity” found that minorities made up 17 per cent of Penn’s faculty.4 People of color made up 27 per cent of assistant professors, 17 per cent of associate professors, and only 9 per cent of full professors. We may take heart that the proportion of minority faculty has almost doubled since 1999, but of the current 17 per cent of faculty who are minorities, 11 per cent are Asian, meaning that the proportions of African American and Latino per faculty are very small indeed (3 per cent of all faculty for both groups). Penn has no career track information on gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) faculty, but my sense is that the tenure and promotion process isn’t especially kind to this group either. In a campus climate study at California Polytechnic State University Pomona, 67 per cent of faculty who identified themselves as GLB in the survey said they did not feel comfortable disclosing their sexual identification to colleagues.5 Thirty per cent of Cal Poly GLB faculty reported having been discriminated against “occasionally” or “frequently” because of their sexual identification. A campus climate study at Duke suggested that “it is less common to find openly gay faculty members in the social sciences than in the arts and humanities, less common still in the hard sciences and the medical school.”6 However, the Duke study couldn’t draw conclusive evidence on GLBT faculty experience because so few respondents answered the GLBT-related questions. Data on transgender faculty experiences are even harder to locate, but campus conflicts over non-discrimination policies for transgender faculty suggest an even less welcoming climate for this group (happily, Penn has such a policy). If faculty are concerned about simply being openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual, then expressly queer faculty - politically irascible, non-heteronormative and even non-homonormative academics - are likely to have an especially hard time. I use here Penn’s figures as an example, but Penn isn’t especially bad - or good - compared with its peers. I also know that some people are leaving academic careers for good, self-chosen, life-affirming reasons. But it is worrisome that these departures are differentially distributed across gender, race, and probably sexuality. The pipeline isn’t leaking, it’s pouring. At a recent Gender Studies conference here at Penn, the leaky pipeline was addressed as a family issue: the tenure clock is hostile to women who want to have children. Indeed, according to Goulden et al., “Women in the sciences who are married with children are 35 per cent less likely to enter a tenure track position after receiving a Ph.D. than married men with children.”7 In another study, Mason and Goulden looked at the National Science Foundation’s longitudinal data from their Survey of Doctorate Recipients, and found that men with children were almost twice as likely to be tenured as women with children (70 per cent of tenured men versus 44 per cent of tenured women had children).8 But this is only part of the problem. If it were only a fertility and childcare issue, minority men would be doing just fine. The tenure and promotion process isn’t only inhuman for women who want and have children; it is inhuman for everyone. Jerry Jacobs found in 2004 that both women and men faculty work on average more than 50 hours per week, irrespective of rank, and about a third of them work more than 60 hours per week.9 The expectation of increased working hours is only likely to grow. The Modern Language Association reported in 2006 that not only research universities, but all academic institutions have greatly increased their expectations of tenure-track faculty to publish articles and books towards their tenure case without reducing their teaching hours.10. © 2011 Barbie Zelizer, editorial and selection matter; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","Mak. the University Matter","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

The results showed a facilitative effect when fearful faces were presented in the blind field, both when the emotional content of the stimuli was relevant (Experiment 2) and irrelevant (Experiment 3) to the task. These findings are in contrast with performances of healthy subjects and patients tested in classical blindsight investigations, who showed response facilitation for congruent pairs of emotional stimuli. The observed implicit visual processing for unseen fearful stimuli might represent an adaptive mechanism for the implementation of efficient defensive responses, probably mediated by a spared sub-cortical and short-latency pathway. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","adult; aged; article; clinical article; emotion; eye movement; fear; female; gender; hemianopia; human; male; reaction time; task performance; visual field; visual field defect; visual stimulation","Blindsight; Fear processing; Hemianopia; Visual residual functions","","","Ministero Istruzione Università e Ricerca","Masson SpA","","","","","","English","Cortex","Article","Final","","Scopus"

A national survey of 1000 randomly selected NIRSA members in North America was completed by means of an on-line questionnaire to determine the perceptions of NIRSA members as to the possible existence of sexual harassment [discrimination] within their own college campus recreation departments, in terms of a) existence of sexual harassment in the work environment, b) frequency of occurrences against males and females, c) examples of sexual harassment, d) frequency of sexual harassment acts, e) reaction to sexual harassment, f) issuance of complaints, g) existence of policies/procedures dealing with sexual harassment, and h) separation between males and females (exclusion, avoidance, distancing). An examination of the data was completed in terms of the respondents' gender, marital status, and gender of one's supervisor. Findings revealed that the vast majority of the respondents felt that their work place was safe, one of respect, one of tolerance, not intimidating and that sexual harassment was not a major factor in their workplace.

The present study investigated the distribution of these navigation strategies as a function of gender, video gaming experience, and self-estimates of spatial navigation abilities in a population of 300 subjects. Participants watched videos of virtual passages through a star-field with one turn in either the horizontal (yaw) or the vertical (pitch) axis. At the end of a passage they selected one out of four homing arrows to indicate the initial starting location. To solve the task, participants could employ two discrete strategies, navigating within either an egocentric or an allocentric reference frame. The majority of valid subjects (232/260) consistently used the same strategy in more than 75% of all trials. With that approach 33.1% of all participants were classified as Turners (using an egocentric reference frame on both axes) and 46.5% as Nonturners (using an allocentric reference frame on both axes). 9.2% of all participants consistently used an egocentric reference frame in the yaw plane but an allocentric reference frame in the pitch plane (Switcher). Investigating the influence of gender on navigation strategies revealed that females predominantly used the Nonturner strategy while males used both the Turner and the Nonturner strategy with comparable probabilities. Other than expected, video gaming experience did not influence strategy use. Based on a strong quantitative basis with the sample size about an order of magnitude larger than in typical psychophysical studies these results demonstrate that most people reliably use one out of three possible navigation strategies (Turners, Nonturners, Switchers) for spatial updating and provides a sound estimate of how those strategies are distributed within the general population. © 2013 Goeke, König and Gramann.","adult; analytical parameters; article; auditory discrimination; controlled study; depth perception; female; human; human experiment; male; mental performance; neuronavigation; normal human; perceptive discrimination; probability; psychophysics; quantitative analysis; recreation; sample size; sex difference; sound detection; spatial discrimination; virtual reality","Gender differences; Navigational strategies; Path integration; Reference frames; Spatial navigation","","","","","","","","","","English","Front.

Employing Dyadic wavelet Transform (DyWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP), we propose a new feature descriptor DyWT-LBP for gender recognition. DyWT is a multi-scale image transformation technique that decomposes an image into a number of sub-bands which separate the features at different scales. DyWT is a kind of translation invariant wavelet transform that has a better potential for detection than Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). On the other hand, LBP is a texture descriptor and is known to be the best for representing texture micro-patterns, which play a key role in the discrimination of different objects in an image. For DyWT, we used spline dyadic wavelets (SDW). There exist many types of SDW; we investigated a number of SDWs for finding the best SDW for gender recognition. The dimension of the feature space generated by DyWT-LBP descriptor becomes excessively high. To tackle this problem, we apply a feature subset selection (FSS) technique that not only reduces the number of features significantly but also improves the recognition accuracy. Through a large number of experiments performed on FERET and Multi-PIE databases, we report for DyWT-LBP descriptor the parameter settings, which result in the best accuracy. The proposed system outperforms the stat of the art gender recognition approaches; it achieved a recognition rate of 99.25% and 99.09% on FERET and Multi-PIE databases, respectively. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Biometrics; Discrete wavelet transforms; Face recognition; Social sciences; Biometric applications; Dyadic wavelet transform; Feature subset selection; FERET; Gender recognition; Image transformations; multi-PIE; Translation invariant wavelet transform; Feature extraction","feature extraction; feature subset selection; FERET; Gender recognition; multi-PIE","","","National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation, NPST, (10-INF1044-02)","World Scientific Publishing Co.

Adverse health effects are thought to occur via social processes including discrimination and structural inequalities (i.e., reduced opportunities for education and income). Although intersectionality has been well-described conceptually, approaches to modeling it in quantitative studies of health outcomes are still emerging. Strategies to date have focused on modeling demographic characteristics as proxies for structural inequality. Our objective was to extend these methodological efforts by modeling intersectionality across three levels: structural, contextual, and interpersonal, consistent with a social-ecological framework. We conducted a secondary analysis of a database that included two components of a widely used survey instrument, the Everyday Discrimination Scale. We operationalized a meso- or interpersonal-level of intersectionality using two variables, the frequency score of discrimination experiences and the sum of characteristics listed as reasons for these (i.e., the person's race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, disability or pregnancy status, or physical appearance). We controlled for two structural inequality factors (low education, poverty) and three contextual factors (high crime neighborhood, racial minority status, and trauma exposures). The outcome variables we modeled were posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and a quality of life index score. We used data from 619 women who completed the Everyday Discrimination Scale for a perinatal study in the U.S. state of Michigan. Statistical results indicated that the two interpersonal-level variables (i.e., number of marginalized identities, frequency of discrimination) explained 15% of variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms and 13% of variance in quality of life scores, improving the predictive value of the models over those using structural inequality and contextual factors alone. This study's results point to instrument development ideas to improve the statistical modeling of intersectionality in health and social science research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Empirical Research; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Michigan; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Quality of Life; Regression Analysis; Social Class; Social Discrimination; Social Identification; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; United States; Michigan; United States; health care; health impact; mental health; public health; quality of life; adult; article; Asian; Caucasian; cross-sectional study; disability; educational status; ethnicity; Everyday Discrimination Scale; female; health disparity; health survey; human; human relation; injury; intersectionality; medical research; mental health; minority group; Negro; outcome assessment; posttraumatic stress disorder; poverty; predictive value; quality of life index; race difference; rating scale; religion; sex difference; sexual orientation; social aspects and related phenomena; social change; social discrimination","Discrimination; Health disparities; Intersectionality; Mental health; Methods; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Quality of life; United States","","","National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Nursing Research, (R01NR008767)","","","","","","","English","Soc.

Utilizing an online survey that recruited via numerous online lesbian communities and snowball sampling, 456 lesbians over the age of 50 responded to closed, Likert scale, and open-ended questions that provided a preliminary understanding of older lesbian sexuality. The results indicated that older lesbians have experienced fluidity in past romantic and sexual relationships, as well as in erotic fantasies, despite strong identification with being lesbian. The findings also indicate a decreased focus on sexuality in the context of relationships, with more focus on stability and continuity. Future research is needed that provides greater specificity and detail about older lesbian conceptions of sexual behavior and sexual identity labels, as well as specific sexual behaviors.

This is the first study that explored the organizational stressors experienced by Indian elite female athletes and the impact on their psychological well-being. Ten participants were interviewed on their experiences with sport organizations in preparation for international tournaments. Drawing on Arnold and Fletcher's (2012) taxonomic classification of organizational stressors in sport performers, a range of first- and second-order themes were identified and categorized. The emergent themes were aligned with the dimensions of psychological well-being (Ryff, 1989a). The study added to the existing literature on organizational stressors by considering them in a different cultural context as well as their link with psychological well-being. Perceived bias and lack of support from the sport organizations, limited access to support staff, and lack of basic training necessities were identified as the most commonly cited stressors. Data analysis led to the emergence of new themes specific to the Indian sports climate, such as, perceived gender discrimination and limited scope for a career in sports for female athletes. Consequently, the stressors resulted in feelings of low environmental mastery and personal growth. Recommendations are made for future research and practical implications for sport organizations and sport psychologists are identified.","","Elite athletes; Flourish; India; Psychological well-being; Stress","","","","","","","","","","English","Int.

Attention is given to how the timing of “transitioning” for transgender parents influences individual and family development. Given the diversity of transgender identifications (e.g., male to female; female to male), the current chapter examines how different gender identifications of transgender parents may shape family formation.

Therefore, it is important to examine the correlates of different forms of activism, such as feminist collective action, among all youth. However, previous research has not investigated young sexual-minority women's engagement with feminist collective action. This study examined predictors of college-aged heterosexual and sexual-minority women's commitment to and participation in feminist activism. Sexual orientation, number of years in college, social support, experiences with discrimination, and gender identity were tested as predictors of commitment to and participation in feminist activism with a sample of 280 college-aged women (173 heterosexuals and 107 sexual minorities). Similar predictors were related to both commitment to and participation in feminist activism. However, for sexual-minority women, but not heterosexual women, the number of years in college was correlated with participation in feminist activism.

Onés own anxiety sweat odor influences the attentional focus, and discrimination of threat or non-threat. Since olfactory projection areas overlap with neuronal areas of a panic-specific fear network, the present study investigated the neuronal processing of odors in general and of stress-related sweat odors in particular in patients with PD.Methods:A sample of 13 patients with PD with/ without agoraphobia and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent an fMRI investigation during olfactory stimulation with their stress-related sweat odors (TSST, ergometry) as well as artificial odors (peach, artificial sweat) as non-fearful non-body odors.Principal Findings:The two groups did not differ with respect to their olfactory identification ability. Independent of the kind of odor, the patients with PD showed activations in fronto-cortical areas in contrast to the healthy controls who showed activations in olfaction-related areas such as the amygdalae and the hippocampus. For artificial odors, the patients with PD showed a decreased neuronal activation of the thalamus, the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Under the presentation of sweat odor caused by ergometric exercise, the patients with PD showed an increased activation in the superior temporal gyrus, the supramarginal gyrus, and the cingulate cortex which was positively correlated with the severity of the psychopathology. For the sweat odor from the anxiety condition, the patients with PD showed an increased activation in the gyrus frontalis inferior, which was positively correlated with the severity of the psychopathology.Conclusions:The results suggest altered neuronal processing of olfactory stimuli in PD. Both artificial odors and stress-related body odors activate specific parts of a fear-network which is associated with an increased severity of the psychopathology. © 2013 Wintermann et al.","Adult; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Ergometry; Female; Humans; Male; Odors; Olfactory Pathways; Panic Disorder; Philosophy; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult; adult; agoraphobia; amygdaloid nucleus; anterior cingulate; article; brain mapping; clinical article; controlled study; ergometry; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; hippocampus; human; male; odor; olfactory system; panic; posterior cingulate; smelling; superior temporal gyrus; supramarginal gyrus; sweating; thalamus","","","","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Guided by ecosocial theory and intersectionality, we used data from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth, a national probability sample, to investigate how one dimension of sexual orientation, sex of sexual partners, and race/ethnicity jointly influence Pap test use among black, Latina and white U.S. women aged 21-44 years (N=8840). We tested for an interaction between sex of sexual partners and race/ethnicity (p=0.015) and estimated multivariable logistic regression models for each racial/ethnic group, adjusting for socio-demographic factors. The adjusted odds of Pap test use for women with only female sexual partners in the past year were significantly lower than for women with only male sexual partners in the past year among white women (odds ratio [OR]=0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12,0.52) and may be lower among black women (OR=0.32, 95% CI: 0.07,1.52); no difference was apparent among Latina women (OR=1.54, 95% CI: 0.31,7.73). Further, the adjusted odds of Pap test use for women with no sexual partners in the past year were significantly lower than for women with only male sexual partners in the past year among white (OR=0.30, 95% CI: 0.22,0.41) and black (OR=0.23, 95% CI: 0.15,0.37) women and marginally lower among Latina women (OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.38,1.03). Adding health care indicators to the models completely explained Pap test use disparities for women with only female vs. only male sexual partners among white women and for women with no vs. only male sexual partners among Latina women.

The prediction that conservatives would show an anti-female candidate bias and liberals would show a pro-female bias when the traditional female gender role is salient was tested across three experimental studies. In Study 1, 126 participants evaluated a male or a female job applicant with thoughts of the traditional female gender role activated or not. Results showed that when the gender role is salient, political ideology moderates evaluations of the female candidates such that conservatives evaluate her negatively and liberals evaluate her positively. Study 2 (89 participants) replicated this effect and showed that this political ideology-based bias does not occur when the non-traditional female gender role is made salient. Study 2 also demonstrated that the observed effects are not driven by liberals' and conservatives' differing perceptions regarding the female applicant's qualifications for the job. Finally, Study 3 (159 participants) both replicated the political ideology-based evaluation bias for female candidates and demonstrated that this bias is mediated by conservatives' and liberals' attitudes toward the roles of women in society. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","","Caregiving; Employment discrimination; Gender bias; Political ideology; Role incongruity; Traditional gender role","","","","","","","","","","English","J.

Chinese lesbian sexualities vary in different historical, social and cultural contexts. One can imagine the differences between the everyday life experiences of Chinese lesbians living in Hong Kong, Taipei, Beijing, Singapore or in diasporic Chinese communities in Vancouver or San Francisco. What does it mean for a global city such as Hong Kong to have lesbian spaces? Conversely, how do lesbian spaces contribute to our common understanding of the city’s cosmopolitan nature? In this chapter, I locate lesbian culture in Hong Kong within a theoretical framework of spaces. In reporting on my ethnography of Hong Kong women with same-sex desires, I first begin to map out the different spaces inhabited by Hong Kong women in order to understand their everyday lives. These spaces include living spaces, sites of consumption, regulatory spaces such as schools, workplaces and churches, and political and cultural spaces. Thirty respondents discussed their experiences of inhabiting, crossing and using these spaces in their daily lives as they live, work, play and engage in different kinds of social relationships that might have been affected by their lesbian sexualities. The interview subjects came from different class backgrounds with an age range of fifteen to fifty-one years old. Interview subjects include women from all walks of life, including students, corporate executives, the unemployed and community activists. I came to know them through personal contacts and referrals from community leaders, as well as by attending social events, political demonstrations, talks, workshops and hanging out at lesbian spaces. My involvement with the Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, first as the Festival Director in 2004 and 2005, then continuing as a curatorial committee member has allowed me to remain part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. In this chapter, I define lesbian desires as erotic and romantic relations that exist among women who may or may not take up sexual identities based on those desires (identities implied in the terms ‘lesbian’ or ‘bisexual’). I use the term lesbian or the local Cantonese term, neoitungzi, to refer to women who have same-sex erotic desires regardless of their sexual identification. Tungzi is a term that can be used to refer to a variety of persons who experience same-sex desires. Tungzi is the local Hong Kong Cantonese pronunciation of the Mandarin term tongzhi (transliterated according to the Hanyu pinyin system). Tongzhi means ‘comrade’ and was first deployed to refer to members of sexual minority groups by Hong Kong cultural icon, film critic and playwright Edward Lam. He first used the term in reference to a gay and lesbian film program he curated for the 1992 Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival (Kong 2010: 14). Hong Kong women with lesbian desires often use culturally specific taxonomies to identify themselves and to express their gender identities. TB or tomboy commonly refers to an androgynous or masculine woman. TBG or tomboy’s girl refers to a woman who is attracted to a TB. However, it is worth noting that not all TBs end up in relationships with TBGs; rather there are multiple forms of relationships that have become more prevalent as gay and lesbian visibility increases. The term pure refers to a woman who prefers to adopt a gender identity that is neither TB nor TBG so as to locate herself outside the TB and TBG coupled relationships. Les and bi are also used to express a woman’s sexual desires as a lesbian or a bisexual. Despite the availability of a range of terms for describing lesbian identities, during my earlier ethnographic fieldwork from 2003 to 2008, it was apparent that many same-sex desiring women in Hong Kong did not readily take up these sexual identities for fear of stigmatisation and discrimination (Tang 2011). The fear of labeling has propelled some women to distance themselves from political movements which advocate sexual rights and human rights for sexual minorities. However, upon returning to Hong Kong in 2011, it appears that the tide has turned as we now see increasing numbers of participants in Pride Parades, anti-homophobia marches and pro-democracy protests. Participants in these marches also include non-Chinese lesbians including Filipino and Indonesian lesbians who are migrant workers in the city. Recent years have seen lesbian and trans activists bridging divides across race and ethnicities to mobilise for issues concerning workers’ rights, human rights, social justice, sex discrimination and sexual rights. Hong Kong is a former British colony which became a Special Administrative Region of Mainland China in 1997. The decriminalisation of homosexuality in Hong Kong in 1991 can be regarded as a final departure from British colonial legislation on homosexuality. Yet as fears of a possible crackdown on freedom of speech by the Beijing government and concerns over the lack of universal suffrage in Hong Kong have increased, LGBT communities have begun to fight for issues beyond sexual rights so as to demonstrate solidarity with other activist groups on a wide range of political issues affecting Hong Kong society (see Kong et al. in this volume). For a city that has been known for its status as an international finance centre and a democratic voice in Chinese territory, LGBT individuals have inherited a historical legacy of being able to voice their discontent despite the lack of formal legal protection, while at the same time exercising their rights as consumer-citizens by going to gay bars, lesbian cafes and attending the annual queer film festival (Kong 2010; Tang 2011). © 2015 selection and editorial material, Mark McLelland and Vera Mackie.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","Routledge Handb. of Sexuality Studies in East Asia","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

Subliminal articles either had a morphosyntactically congruent or incongruent gender with the targets. In a gender-classification task of the target nouns, subliminal articles primed the responses: responses were faster in congruent than incongruent conditions (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we tested whether this congruence effect depended on gender relevance. In line with a relevance-dependence, the congruence effect only occurred in a gender-classification task but was absent in another categorical discrimination of the target nouns (Experiment 2). The congruence effect also depended on correct word order. It was diminished when nouns preceded articles (Experiment 3). Finally, the congruence effect was replicated with a larger set of targets but only for masculine targets (Experiment 4).

In this study, vowel classification of children was investigated for sustained Malay vowels which were produced by Malay children between 7 to 12 years of age, all of whom were categorized into 12 different age and gender groups. Each of the subjects was asked to pronounce all 6 sustained Malay vowels. After a thorough discrimination test, fundamental and formant frequencies (F0- F3) were extracted. Different combinations of fundamental and formant frequencies were examined to find the best combination by applying the Euclidean minimum distance formula on normalized and non-normalized data. Our results showed around 17% improvement when using normalized data. Moreover, different combinations of fundamental and formant frequencies were examined on vowel classification by applying MLP. Based on the results, the best rate of correct classification was 87.50% when using the Euclidean method and 85.79% when using the MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) method with combinations of fundamental and first three formants frequencies (F0, F1, F2 &amp; F3) in both methods.

In different blocks, participants performed age and gender classifications for old or young unfamiliar faces (50% female respectively). Both tasks elicited activations in the bilateral fusiform gyri (fusiform face area, FFA) and bilateral inferior occipital gyri (occipital face area, OFA). Importantly, the same stimuli elicited enhanced activation during gender as compared to age categorization.

Therefore in this study, we tested the ability of 167 participants (54 women and 113 men, aged between 20 and 59. years old) to correctly identify 36 common odours, and we verified whether such ability could be related to their level of neophobia toward food and to demographic parameters (i.e., age, gender, and smoking habits). In the analyses, an advantage in odour identification abilities for non-neophobic people over more-neophobic participants was observed. As for participants' demographic information, a smaller reluctance to try new food in older than younger people was highlighted. The results of the present study suggest a connection between the attitude toward the exploration of the chemosensory environment and the ability to identify odours. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adult; Age Distribution; Analysis of Variance; Choice Behavior; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Preferences; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odors; Phobic Disorders; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Distribution; Smell; Young Adult; adult; age; article; female; food neophobia; food preference; gender; human; human experiment; male; neophobia; normal human; odor; olfactory discrimination; perceptive threshold; questionnaire; rating scale; reliability; smelling; smoking habit","Demographic parameters; Food exposure; Neophobia; Odour identification","","","Provincia Autonoma di Trento, (AP 2009/2011)","","","","","","","English","Appetite","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Data for this study was derived from the children's record of the 2007 India National Family Health Survey, which is a nationally representative cross-sectional household survey. Data is segregated according to birth order 1 to 5 to assess mother's occupation, Mother's education, child's gender, Mother's age, place of residence, wealth index, mother's anaemia level, prenatal care, assistance at delivery, antenatal care, place of delivery and other maternal factors contributing to under-five mortality. Out of total 51555 births, analysis is restricted to 16567 children of first birth order, 14409 of second birth order, 8318 of third birth order, 5021 of fourth birth order and 3034 of fifth birth order covering 92% of the total births taken place 0-59 months prior to survey. Mother's average age in years for birth orders 1 to 5 are 23.7, 25.8, 27.4, 29 and 31 years, respectively. Most mothers whose children died are Hindu, with no formal education, severely anaemic and working in the agricultural sector. In multivariate logistic models, maternal education, wealth index and breastfeeding are protective factors across all birth orders. In birth order model 1 and 2, mother's occupation is a significant risk factor. In birth order models 2 to 5, previous birth interval of lesser than 24 months is a risk factor. Child's gender is a risk factor in birth order 1 and 5. Information regarding complications in pregnancy and prenatal care act as protective factors in birth order 1, place of delivery and immunization in birth order 2, and child size at birth in birth order 4. Prediction models demonstrate high discrimination that indicates that our models fit the data. The study has policy implications such as enhancing the Information, Education and Communication network for mothers, especially at higher birth orders, in order to reduce under-five mortality. The study emphasises the need of developing interventions to address the issues of anaemia, mothers working in the agricultural sector and improving relevant literacy among mothers. © 2013 Singh and Tripathi; licensee Springer.","","Birth order; Demographic and health survey (DHS); India; Under-five mortality","","","","SpringerOpen","","","","","","English","SpringerPlus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair regarding sensitive features such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to develop fairness-aware or discrimination-aware data mining techniques that take into account issues of social fairness, discrimination, and neutrality. In this paper, after demonstrating the applications of these techniques, we explore the formal concepts of fairness and techniques for handling fairness in data mining. We then provide an integrated view of these concepts based on statistical independence. Finally, we discuss the relations between fairness-aware data mining and other research topics, such as privacy-preserving data mining or causal inference. © 2012 IEEE.","Data privacy; Credit data; Credit scoring; Data mining techniques; Data mining technology; Discrimination; Fairness; Formal concepts; Privacy preserving data mining; Research topics; Sensitive features; Statistical independence; Statistical prediction; Data mining","Discrimination; Fairness; Privacy","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (22500142, 23240043)","","12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2012","95285","Brussels","10 December 2012 through 10 December 2012","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

It was applied to 155 students between 7 and 12 years of age (9,3 +1,24), in a public institution of the municipality of Murcia (Spain), in the months of September 2008 and June 2009. The duration of the intervention was conducted in eight sessions that were distributed in a month. The results show, first, that children revealed more sexist attitudes about girls before and after the intervention. On the other hand, the effectiveness of intervention for the development of attitudes of equality, influenced in the same way in both genders and ages, and it did reduce these behaviors throughout the school year.

We introduce a kernel-based representation approach to support MRI discrimination. In this sense, inherent Inter-Slice Kernel relationship is employed to highlight brain structure distributions. Then, a generalized Euclidean metric is estimated by using a kernel-based centered alignment algorithm to code the correlation between MRI dependencies and prior demographic patient information. The proposed approach is tested on MRI data classification by considering patient gender and age categories. Attained results show that proposed methodology improves data interpretability and separability in comparison to state of the art algorithms based on MRI Voxel-wise features.

An examination of 112 films released between 1971 and 2011 found that only 15 films portrayed female municipal police officers in either the leading or joint leading role. Findings revealed that key barriers regularly faced by female police officers, such as sexual harassment, gender harassment, and gender discrimination, were not addressed in the films. Female municipal police officers were, however, repeatedly depicted as having had intimate relationships with senior male police officers and/or portrayed as becoming officers because of being scarred emotionally or mentally by past traumatic events. According to cultivation theory, such depictions would cultivate a perceived social reality in which females only become police officers if they are emotionally scarred and intimacy with male colleagues is the norm. This study provides insight into the potential impact the lack and quality of existing portrayals have on the recruitment, hiring, and retention of female municipal police officers. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","criminological cultivation; cultivation; female; film; law enforcement; perception; police; recruitment; retention; unified film population identification methodology","","","","Routledge","","","","","","English","Women Crim.

Female undergraduate participants were asked to recall past experiences and observations of sexism, as well as their confronting behaviors. Path modeling in Study 1 (N = 148) demonstrated that women were more likely to report confronting if they believed that the confrontation would make a difference (perceived benefits), or they were less concerned about social sanctions (perceived costs), and the prediction patterns were similar for both experienced and observed sexism. Study 2 (N = 166) replicated the results of Study 1, as well as tested the moderating influence of gender identification. In situations of higher perceived social costs, women who were less strongly identified with their gender group were more responsive to the perceived benefits of the confrontation when deciding whether to confront on behalf of the self. The results of the two studies suggest that researchers should investigate methods for enhancing perceived social benefits and reducing perceived social costs when designing intervention programs aimed at increasing confrontation and decreasing the prevalence of discrimination. © The Author(s) 2012.","","confrontation; decision making; feminism; sex discrimination; sexism; social change; social identity; social interaction","","","","","","","","","","English","Psychol.

Critical consciousness comprises several dimensions, including social group identification, discontent with distribution of social power, rejection of social system legitimacy, and a collective action orientation. The current study investigated self-reported critical consciousness as a moderator of perceived gender and racial discrimination on HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count in 67 African American HIV-infected women. Higher critical consciousness was found to be related to higher likelihood of having CD4+ counts over 350 and lower likelihood of detectable viral load when perceived racial discrimination was high, as revealed by multiple logistic regressions that controlled for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Multiple linear regressions showed that at higher levels of perceived gender and racial discrimination, women endorsing high critical consciousness had a larger positive difference between nadir CD4+ (lowest pre-HAART) and current CD4+ count than women endorsing low critical consciousness. These findings suggest that raising awareness of social oppression to promote joining with others to enact social change may be an important intervention strategy to improve HIV outcomes in African American HIV-infected women who report experiencing high levels of gender and racial discrimination. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","African Americans; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Chicago; Disease Progression; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Medication Adherence; Patient Outcome Assessment; Questionnaires; Racism; Resilience, Psychological; Sexism; United States; Viral Load; African American; CD4 lymphocyte count; clinical trial; coping behavior; disease course; ethnology; female; HIV Infections; human; longitudinal study; medication compliance; multicenter study; outcome assessment; psychology; questionnaire; racism; sexism; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; United States; virus load","African American women; Critical consciousness; HIV; Perceived gender discrimination; Perceived racial discrimination; Protective factor","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (F31MH095510); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA; National Cancer Institute, NCI; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (5U01A1034993, P30AI082151, U01AI034993)","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","AIDS Behav.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Feature extraction used a collection of concentric cylinders to define volumes for counting 3D points. The histogram features are characterized by a rotational axis and a selected set of volumes derived from the concentric cylinders. The point cloud images are drawn from the CAESAR anthropometric database provided by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Human Effectiveness Directorate and SAE International. This database contains approximately 4400 high resolution LIDAR whole body scans of carefully posed human subjects. Success from our previous investigation was based on extracting features from full body coverage which required integration of multiple camera images. With the full body coverage, the central vertical body axis and orientation are readily obtainable; however, this is not the case with a one camera view providing less than one half body coverage. Assuming that the subjects are upright, we need to determine or estimate the position of the vertical axis and the orientation of the body about this axis relative to the camera. In past experiments the vertical axis was located through the center of mass of torso points projected on the ground plane and the body orientation derived using principle component analysis. In a natural extension of our previous work to partial body views, the absence of rotational invariance about the cylindrical axis greatly increases the difficulty for gender classification. Even the problem of estimating the axis is no longer simple. We describe some simple feasibility experiments that use partial image histograms. Here, the cylindrical axis is assumed to be known. We also discuss experiments with full body images that explore the sensitivity of classification accuracy relative to displacements of the cylindrical axis. Our initial results provide the basis for further investigation of more complex partial body viewing problems and new methods for estimating the two position coordinates for the axis location and the unknown body orientation angle. © 2012 SPIE.","Cameras; Computation theory; Cylinders (shapes); Estimation; Experiments; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Graphic methods; Optical radar; Principal component analysis; Social sciences; Three dimensional computer graphics; Air Force Research Laboratory; Classification accuracy; Feasibility experiments; Gender classification; Gender recognition; Multiple camera images; Principle component analysis; Rotational invariances; Image processing","gender recognition; genetic algorithms; LIDAR images","","","","","Evolutionary and Bio-Inspired Computation: Theory and Applications VI","95992","Baltimore, MD","25 April 2012 through 26 April 2012","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Information theory; Logistics; Regression analysis; Analysis techniques; Credit data; Credit scoring; Data mining technology; discrimination; Discriminative models; fairness; Logistic regressions; Prediction algorithms; Regularization approach; Regularizer; Sensitive features; Sensitive informations; Social responsibilities; Statistical prediction; Learning systems","classification; discrimination; fairness; information theory; logistic regression; social responsibility","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (24500194)","","2012 European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML-PKDD 2012","93009","Bristol","24 September 2012 through 28 September 2012","University of Bristol; Departments of Computer Science and Engineering Mathematics; Faculty of Engineering; PASCAL2 Network of Excellence; EternalS FP7 Coordination Action","English","Lect.

In addition to being one of the only simultaneous examinations of RBD and GBD in multiple comparison groups, the current study includes both self-report and objective behavioral data to examine the independent and interactive effects of both forms of discrimination. This study is also the first of its kind to examine these constructs in these ways and to explore their impact in a unique sample of ethnically diverse male and female Marine recruits (N = 1,516). As anticipated, both RBD and GBD had a strong and consistent negative impact on mental health symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), independent of the contributions of gender and race. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that people of color are able to maintain resiliency (as measured by physical fitness testing) in the face of low levels of RBD, but are less able to overcome the negative effects of discrimination at high levels. It is interesting to note that the interaction between race, gender, and levels of discrimination was only found with objective physical fitness test scores but not with self-report measures. These findings underscore the importance of including objective measures when assessing the impact of discrimination in order to understand these complex interrelationships.","Adult; Anxiety; Continental Population Groups; Depression; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Models, Theoretical; Racism; Regression Analysis; Sex Factors; Sexism; United States; Young Adult; adult; anxiety; article; depression; female; fitness; human; longitudinal study; male; mental health; normal human; prediction; racism; sailor; self report; sexism; social support","Double jeopardy; Gender-based discrimination; Marines; Race-based discrimination","","","","","","","","","","English","Cult.

Compared to the Gaussian mixture model(GMM) based conventional methods, the proposed method benefits from two main advantages: first, DNNs are discriminative models which can provide better discrimination on confusion regions of different accents; second, they have the hierarchical nonlinear feature extraction capability which can learn discriminative high-level features for the specified task. In detail, the speech data of all accents is used to train DNNs, and in the testing stage, we first identify the accent label of each frame, then determine the sentence label by the majority voting conducted on the frame labels. The experiments on accented English and Mandarin corpus demonstrate that, compared to the GMM based methods, our proposed method can significantly improve the frame accuracy as well as sentence accuracy on the test set. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method can be further improved by using context information.

We propose a method for the prediction of normal, overweight, and obese classes based only on the combination of voice features that are associated with BMI status, independently of weight and height measurements. Materials and methods: A total of 1568 subjects were divided into 4 groups according to age and gender differences. We performed statistical analyses by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe test to find significant features in each group. We predicted BMI status (normal, overweight, and obese) by a logistic regression algorithm and two ensemble classification algorithms (bagging and random forests) based on statistically significant features. Results: In the Female-2030 group (females aged 20-40 years), classification experiments using an imbalanced (original) data set gave area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.569-0.731 by logistic regression, whereas experiments using a balanced data set gave AUC values of 0.893-0.994 by random forests. AUC values in Female-4050 (females aged 41-60 years), Male-2030 (males aged 20-40 years), and Male-4050 (males aged 41-60 years) groups by logistic regression in imbalanced data were 0.585-0.654, 0.581-0.614, and 0.557-0.653, respectively. AUC values in Female-4050, Male-2030, and Male-4050 groups in balanced data were 0.629-0.893 by bagging, 0.707-0.916 by random forests, and 0.695-0.854 by bagging, respectively. In each group, we found discriminatory features showing statistical differences among normal, overweight, and obese classes. The results showed that the classification models built by logistic regression in imbalanced data were better than those built by the other two algorithms, and significant features differed according to age and gender groups. Conclusion: Our results could support the development of BMI diagnosis tools for real-time monitoring; such tools are considered helpful in improving automated BMI status diagnosis in remote healthcare or telemedicine and are expected to have applications in forensic and medical science. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Adult; Age Factors; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Body Mass Index; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Republic of Korea; Sex Factors; Voice; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Diseases; Experiments; Forecasting; Health; Health care; Learning algorithms; Logistics; Medical applications; Regression analysis; Body mass index; Cardio-vascular disease; Classification models; Ensemble classification; Logistic regression algorithms; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Statistical differences; Voice signals; adult; article; body height; body mass; body weight; clinical assessment; controlled study; emergency health service; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical information; priority journal; random forest; sex difference; speech discrimination; telemedicine; Diagnosis","Body mass index; Multi-class prediction; Obesity diagnosis; Voice signals","","","Development of Measurement Devices of Qi and Blood, (K13260); Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, KIOM; Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, KOSEF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST, (2006-2005173, 20120009001)","","","","","","","English","Artif.

However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions.

More than 30% of the patients remain drug resistant to CBZ mono-therapy. CBZ is transported by the P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The P-gp encoded by the ABCB1 and ABCC2 genes are expressed in drug resistant patients with epilepsy. A few studies have shown significant association between CBZ resistant epilepsy and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) with adjacent polymorphisms of these genes. Our study is aimed at determining the correlation between patients' response to CBZ mono-therapy to Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms G2677T and C3435T of the ABCB1 gene as well as G1249A and -24C>T of the ABCC2 gene.Method:314 patients with CPS were recruited from the Neurology Department of the KLH based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, of whom 152 were responders and the other 162 were non-responders. DNA was extracted from their blood samples and Taqman technology for allelic discrimination was performed. Results were described as genotype frequencies. The SHEsis analysis platform was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium index and infer haplotype frequencies. Haploview was used to do permutation test to obtain a corrected p-value.Results:Resistance to treatment with CBZ mono-therapy was significantly associated with the 2677TT and the 3435TT genotypes while it was not significantly associated with the G1249A and -24C>T polymorphisms. The GCGC haplotype combination of the 2677G>T, 3435C>T, 1249G>A and -24C>T respectively was found to be extremely significant (p = 1.10e-20) with good drug response to CBZ mono-therapy.Conclusion:Linkage disequilibrium between the 2677G>T, 3435C>T, 1249G>A and -24C>T SNPs may be used as a reliable screening marker to determine the treatment outcome of CBZ mono-therapy with CPS irrespective of race or gender. © 2013 Subenthiran et al.","Adult; Anticonvulsants; Carbamazepine; Epilepsies, Partial; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Haplotypes; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins; P-Glycoprotein; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Treatment Outcome; carbamazepine; multidrug resistance protein 1; ABCB1 gene; abcc2 gene; adult; allele; article; blood sampling; complex partial seizure; controlled study; DNA extraction; drug blood level; female; gene; gene frequency; gene identification; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic variability; haplotype; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; monotherapy; single nucleotide polymorphism; treatment outcome","","","carbamazepine, 298-46-4, 8047-84-5; ABCB1 protein, human, ; Anticonvulsants, ; Carbamazepine, 33CM23913M; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins, ; P-Glycoprotein, ; multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, ","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, some women do attain top leadership positions, leading scholars to probe under what conditions women are promoted despite seemingly intractable and well-documented barriers. Previous scholarship tends to posit individual-level explanations, suggesting either that women who attain top leadership positions are exceptional or that potential women leaders lack key qualities, such as assertiveness. Much less scholarship has explored institutional-level mechanisms that may increase women's ascension to top positions. This analysis seeks to fill this gap by testing three institutional-level theories that may shape women's access to and tenure in top positions: the glass cliff, decision-maker diversity, and the saviour effect. To test these theories we rely on a dataset that includes all CEO transitions in Fortune 500 companies over a 20-year period. Contrary to the predictions of the glass cliff, we find that diversity among decision makers - not firm performance - significantly increases women's likelihood of being promoted to top leadership positions. We also find, contrary to the predictions of the saviour effect, that diversity among decision makers increases women leaders' tenure as CEOs regardless of firm performance. By identifying contextual factors that increase women's mobility, the paper makes an important contribution to the processes that shape and reproduce gender inequality in work organizations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","gender relations; institutional framework; leadership; organizational framework; womens employment; womens status","Discrimination; Diversity; Gender; Glass cliffs; Leadership","","","","","","","","","","English","Gender Work Organ.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

To address this issue, we systematically explored men and women's performance for rotated patterns by assessing recognition, confidence rating and response time, thought to be fundamental to spatial processing, with classical methods, and with signal detection theory (SDT) parameters (d-prime and c-bias). Among our findings, we highlight d-prime as the most robust parameter to assess gender differences and predict group membership. Furthermore, we conclude that better performance by men is due to their strategy of transforming a mental rotation task into a simpler task comparing the alignment of test stimuli to the surrounding experimental environment.","","Clockwise and counterclockwise rotations; Discrimination; Mental rotation; Sex differences; Visual sensitivity; Visuo-spatial cognition","","","","","","","","","","English","Europ.

The human face and body are rich sources of socio-emotional cues. Accurate recognition of these cues is central to adaptive social functioning. Past studies indicate that individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits in the perception of emotion from facial cues but the contribution of bodily cues to social perception in schizophrenia is undetermined. The present study examined the detection of social cues from human gait patterns presented by computer-generated volumetric walking figures. Method. A total of 22 SZ and 20 age-matched healthy control participants (CO) viewed 1 s movies of a 'digital' walker's gait and subsequently made a forced-choice decision on the emotional state (angry or happy) or the gender of the walker presented at three intensity levels. Overall sensitivity to the social cues and bias were computed. For SZ, symptom severity was assessed. Results. SZ were less sensitive than CO on both emotion and gender discrimination, regardless of intensity. While impaired overall, greater signal intensity did improve performance of SZ. Neither group differed in their response bias in either condition. The discrimination sensitivity of SZ was unrelated to their social functioning or symptoms but a bias toward perceiving gait as happy was associated with better social functioning. Conclusions. These results suggest that SZ are impaired in extracting social information from gait but SZ benefited from increased signal intensity of social cues. Inaccurate perception of social cues in others may hinder adequate preparation for social interactions.

These changes radically influenced the psychological day-to-day reality of lesbian and gay military members. Yet, given the military culture, lesbian and gay members only began to come out in significant numbers at the turn of the century.

In much of the early research, the experiences of sexual minority women and men were considered together (or women's experiences were inferred from men's), obscuring important differences. There is empirical and theoretical justification to consider the experiences of women and men separately and to develop and evaluate comprehensive models of sexual minority stress for women. Existing conceptualizations of sexual minority stress that include assessment of discrimination, victimization, harassment, concealment, internalized homonegativity may be applied, and perhaps adapted, to facilitate understanding of the unique stressors associated with women's sexual minority status. Future research must include mediators of the relationship between stressors and outcomes such as individual (e.g., coping and resilience) and group (e.g., social support, identification with a sexual minority community) resources. It is also essential to understand what factors may buffer the deleterious effects of these stressors. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation, Psychological; Bisexuality; Female; Gender Identity; Homosexuality, Female; Humans; Internal-External Control; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Minority Groups; Prejudice; Self Concept; Self Disclosure; Social Conformity; Social Identification; Social Perception; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; adaptive behavior; bisexuality; control; female; gender identity; human; human relation; lesbian; male; mental stress; minority group; perception; psychological aspect; review; self concept; self disclosure; social behavior; social psychology; social support","lesbian; minority stress; sexual minority stress; sexual minority women; sexual orientation; stigma","","","","","","","","","","English","J.

In this article, I recognize that actuarial risk logic offers managerial and organizational benefits, but I also demonstrate that the application of actuarial risk when sentencing offenders is not without important consequences. First, I provide a brief outline of the emergence, logic, and entrenchment of probabilistic reasoning within criminal justice decision-making, and the more recent extension and application of actuarial risk logic to sentencing. Then, I use the following themes to define the limits of using risk sciences in sentencing: (1) the logical structure of risk; (2) the slippage between risk prediction and individual causation; (3) current methodological limits of risk science; (4) the potential for gender and race discrimination; (5) the legal relevance and transparency of risk-based sentencing; and (6) the jurisprudential and organizational impact of various risk technologies. Importantly, the nature and severity of these complications will vary by, and within, the jurisdiction (or sentencing regime) because current sentencing practices are influenced by local jurisdictional needs and sentencing laws. © 2013 Copyright Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.","","actuarial justice; disparity; gender; punishment; race; risk; sentencing; theory","","","","","","","","","","English","Justice Q.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It calls for the repeal of the existing law (title 10, United States Code, sec. 654) barring open homosexuality in the military by prescribing a series of steps that must take place before repeal occurs. One step was fulfilled on July 22, 2011, when the President signed the certification of the process ending the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy which will be repealed on September 20, 2011. However, in repealing the law and the so-called 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, a number of issues have been raised, but were not addressed by P.L. 111-321. This report considers issues that Congress may wish to consider as the repeal process proceeds. Under the Constitution, Congress has the authority for making ""rules for the government and regulation"" of the military services. Legislation has been proposed in the 112th Congress that could affect the repeal process by requiring the certification of the repeal by all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and not just the Chairman as is currently the case. It has also been suggested that Congress could hold hearings before or after the final repeal occurs concerning such matters as the repeal process and anticipated changes in other laws regarding military benefits, for example. Issues for consideration include, but are not limited to, congressional oversight of the repeal process, differences in benefits and privileges some individuals may experience (especially differences created under the Defense of Marriage Act), changes involving sodomy prohibitions, and efforts by some to expand the repeal to include transgender individuals. Certain military benefits and privileges are extended to spouses as defined by law. Under the Defense of Marriage Act, the Federal government recognizes marriage as the union of one man and one woman. However, certain states recognize same-sexmarriages. Thus, it is possible for a same-sex couple to be legally married but not eligible for certain military benefits and privileges. Laws prohibiting sodomy (defined as 'unnatural carnal copulation') in the military context have varied over time. Currently, there exists proposed language in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act in the 112th Congress that would remove sodomy from the Uniformed Code of Military Justice; effectively decriminalizing sodomy. Similar language does not exist in the House version. The repeal of the ban on homosexual behavior has encouraged some to expand efforts to end discrimination against so-called 'transgender' individuals. Based on military fitness policies, individuals who have a history of mental disorders that, in the opinion of the medical examiner, would interfere with or prevent satisfactory performance of military duties are not allowed to serve. Among the disorders sited are ""sexual and gender identity disorders."" (These disorders are listed in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification or ICD-9- CM, 302.) At one time, homosexuality was listed as a psychiatric disorder, but this was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1973. Some have argued that other ""gender disorders"" should also be removed. Along these lines, advocates believe it is unfair for the military to continue to discriminate against these individuals. Others, however, believe that until the DSM and ICD-9-CM are changed, such individuals should continue to be barred from serving. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The human face is one of the most important human biometric characteristics, which contains a lot of important information, such as identity, gender, age, expression, race and so on. Human age is a significant reference for identity discrimination, and age estimation can be potentially applied in human-computer interaction, computer vision and business intelligence. This paper addresses the problem of accurate estimation of human age. An age estimation system is generally composed of aging feature extraction and feature classification. In the feature extraction part, well-known texture descriptors like the Gabor wavelets and the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) have been utilized for the feature extraction. In our method, we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract facial features. We gain the convolution activation features through building a multilevel CNN model based-on abundant training data. In the feature classification part, we divide different ages into 13 groups and use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to perform the classification. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the previous methods when using our aging database. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Convolution; Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Human computer interaction; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Textures; Accurate estimation; Age estimation; Convolutional neural network; Face recognition technologies; Feature classification; Gabor wavelets; Local binary patterns; Texture descriptors; Classification (of information)","Age estimation; Classification; Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction; SVM","","","","Springer Verlag","15th Pacific-Rim Conference on Multimedia, PCM 2014","110039","Kuching","1 December 2014 through 4 December 2014","","English","Lect.

We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a continuous recognition paradigm in which participants indicated on each trial whether the spoken word was ""new"" or ""old."" Old items were presented at 2, 8 or 16 words following the first presentation. Context congruency was manipulated by having the same word repeated by either the same speaker or a different speaker. The different speaker could share the gender, accent or neither feature with the word presented the first time. Participants' accuracy was greatest when the old word was spoken by the same speaker than by a different speaker. In addition, accuracy decreased with increasing lag. The correct identification of old words was accompanied by an enhanced late positivity over parietal sites, with no difference found between voice congruency conditions. In contrast, an earlier voice reinstatement effect was observed over frontal sites, an index of priming that preceded recollection in this task. Our results provide further evidence that acoustic and semantic information are integrated into a unified trace and that acoustic information facilitates spoken word recollection. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Brain; Brain Mapping; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Psycholinguistics; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Verbal Learning; Vocabulary; Young Adult; accuracy; adult; article; auditory discrimination; auditory memory; auditory stimulation; event related potential; facilitation; female; frontal cortex; human; human experiment; linguistics; male; memory consolidation; normal human; parietal cortex; response time; semantics; sex difference; speech articulation; speech discrimination; word list recall; word recognition; young adult; analysis of variance; brain; brain mapping; electroencephalography; evoked response; learning; linguistics; physiology; reaction time; recognition","Auditory memory; ERP; Recognition memory; Source memory; Voice","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (MOP 106619); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","","","","","","","English","Neuropsychologia","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This paper presents group classification tasks using kinetic and kinematic data from a prospective running injury study. Groups composed of gender, of shod/barefoot running and of runners who developed patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) during the study, and asymptotic runners were classified. The features computed from the biomechanical data were deliberately chosen to be generic. Therefore, they were suited for different biomechanical measurements and classification tasks without adaptation to the input signals. Feature ranking was applied to reveal the relevance of each feature to the classification task. Data from 80 runners were analysed for gender and shod/barefoot classification, while 12 runners were investigated in the injury classification task. Gender groups could be differentiated with 84.7%, shod/barefoot running with 98.3%, and PFPS with 100% classification rate. For the latter group, one single variable could be identified that alone allowed discrimination. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Adult; Athletic Injuries; Biomechanics; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prospective Studies; Running; Sex Characteristics; Shoes; Young Adult; Adaptive boosting; Biomechanics; Diseases; Kinematics; Pattern recognition; Biomechanical data; Biomechanical measurement; Classification rates; Classification tasks; Feature ranking; Generic features; Group classification; Input signal; Kinematic data; Patellofemoral pain syndromes; Running injuries; Single variable; adult; article; automated pattern recognition; biomechanics; classification; comparative study; evaluation; female; human; longitudinal study; male; methodology; middle aged; patellofemoral pain syndrome; pathophysiology; physiology; prospective study; running; sexual development; shoe; sport injury; statistics; validation study; Social sciences","AdaBoost; Biomechanical group classification; Feature ranking; Generic features; Patellofemoral pain syndrome; Pattern classification","","","","","","","","","","English","Comput.

They justify their use of actuarial statistics due to its accuracy as a predictor of risk. South African motor-vehicle insurers use gender, inter alia, as a rating variable to classify risks into certain classes and to determine insurance premiums. Depending upon whether the insured is male or female, it could have a significant impact on the cost of his or her premium. Women drivers pay less for motor-vehicle insurance because actuarial statistics indicate that women are more careful drivers and are involved in 20 per cent fewer accidents than men. Men pay higher premiums because the statistics indicate that they are less responsible drivers than women. Should a South African court decide that the use of gender as a motor-vehicle insurance rating variable is unfair discrimination, this would benefit male drivers, as it would lower their premium. Women, on the other hand, would be disadvantaged as they would be required to pay higher premiums to subsidise men. The article examines the impact that the removal of gender as a rating variable in motor-vehicle insurance would have on women, and asks if the effects thereof would influence a South African Court’s decision in determining if the use of gender as a rating variable amounts to unfair discrimination. The article first considers the findings of American and Canadian Courts in determining this same issue and then considers South African equality legislation, particularly the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000 (“the Equality Act”). Thereafter, the article provides recommendations for a South African Court. As the Equality Act indicates that the discriminatory insurance practice of placing a disadvantage or advantage on persons based inter alia on their gender may possibly be unfair, it is suggested that South African insurers would have to consider alternative methods of risk assessment. In the light of the American and the Canadian case law, the article suggests that there should be a change of approach to insurance risk assessment. Rather than using gender as a rating variable the insurer could assess the risk of the individual insured, using appropriate, neutral rating variables suited to the particular circumstances of the insured. This would require a much more intensive and individualised risk evaluation and would require the insurer to “tailor-make” insurance for each individual. It is submitted that such an approach would give effect to the right to equality by disallowing the use of gender as a rating variable without producing the undesirable consequence that women drivers would have to subsidise men. © 2017, North-West Unversity.

This study examined the relationship between perceived discrimination by adults and peers in the school setting and depressive symptoms in a sample (N 95) of racial minority immigrant-origin adolescents (13 to 19 years of age) attending an urban high school. We examined the relation between perceived discrimination and depressive symptomology across gender and nativity status (foreign born vs. U.S. born), and the potential moderating role of ethnic identity and social support. Consistent with previous research, girls reported higher levels of depressive symptomology than boys, although the relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms was significant for both boys and girls. Perceived discrimination by adults and by peers at school was positively related to depressive symptoms for U.S.-born adolescents. For U.S.-born adolescents, ethnic identity mitigated the negative effects of perceived adult discrimination on depressive symptoms. However, ethnic identity did not moderate the relationship between perceived peer discrimination and depressive symptoms. Social support did not moderate the relationship between adult and peer discrimination and depressive symptoms for either foreign-born or U.S.-born adolescents. The findings supportprevious research concerning the immigrant paradox and highlight the importance of context in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health.

Use of such discriminatory historical decision making as training data can perpetuate discrimination, even if the protected attributes are not directly present in the data. This work focuses on discovering discrimination in instances and preventing discrimination in classification. First, we propose a discrimination discovery method based on modeling the probability distribution of a class using Bayesian networks. This measures the effect of a protected attribute (e.g., gender) in a subset of the dataset using the estimated probability distribution (via a Bayesian network). Second, we propose a classification method that corrects for the discovered discrimination without using protected attributes in the decision process. We evaluate the discrimination discovery and discrimination prevention approaches on two different datasets. The empirical results show that a substantial amount of discrimination identified in instances is prevented in future decisions. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Data mining; Data processing; Decision making; Probability distributions; Classification methods; Decision process; Discrimination discovery; Discrimination prevention; Training data; Bayesian networks","Bayesian network; Data mining; Discrimination discovery; Discrimination prevention","","","","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","English","Artif Intell Law","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The vast majority of sex-classification policies are not rationally related to legitimate policy goals because there is no objective, socially agreed upon test for determining who is male and who is female, and legitimate policy goals such as fraud prevention, safety, security, and privacy can almost always be met more effectively by alternative means that do not subject people to gender inspection. I make a legal-normative argument for using gender-identity antidiscrimination laws to abolish sex-classification policies. I ground this radical proposal in a modified liberalism that treats sexual self-definition as an integral feature of liberal self-definition. Gender and intersectionality theorists rightly point out the deep structure of race-sex-class perception and oppression, but many of these theorists are too quick to dismiss the radical potential of gender-identity discrimination laws to eliminate, rather than modify, longstanding sex-classification policies. Racial, class and gender perception intersect to generate the possibility, rather than the inevitability, of invidious sex administration. And that is more than enough reason to abandon sex-classification policies. © 2014 American Political Science Association.","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","English","Perspect.

Discrimination significantly related to aspects of racial identity, including immersion-emersion, public regard, encounter, Afrocentricity/racial centrality/private regard, and internalization. Distress significantly correlated with preencounter/assimilation, encounter, public regard, immersion-emersion, and Afrocentricity/racial centrality/private regard.

There are, however, negative social perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy invasion and potential discrimination. The latter consists of unfairly treating people on the basis of their belonging to a specific group. Automated data collection and data mining techniques such as classification rule mining have paved the way to making automated decisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation, etc. If the training data sets are biased in what regards discriminatory (sensitive) attributes like gender, race, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions may ensue. For this reason, antidiscrimination techniques including discrimination discovery and prevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on nonsensitive attributes which are strongly correlated with biased sensitive ones. In this paper, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose new techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention individually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training data sets and outsourced data sets in such a way that direct and/or indirect discriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (nondiscriminatory) classification rules. We also propose new metrics to evaluate the utility of the proposed approaches and we compare these approaches. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective at removing direct and/or indirect discrimination biases in the original data set while preserving data quality. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Data privacy; Insurance; Antidiscrimination; Automated data collection; Classification rules; direct and indirect discrimination prevention; Experimental evaluation; rule generalization; rule protection; Sensitive attribute; Data mining","Antidiscrimination; data mining; direct and indirect discrimination prevention; privacy; rule generalization; rule protection","","","","","","","","","","English","IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng","Article","Final","","Scopus"

A nonprobability sample of LGBT patients from a community health center (N = 1457) ranged in age from 19-70 years.

Nuanced gender differences revealed that substance use problems did not significantly mediate the relationship between victimization and suicide attempts for sexual minority men.

G-Money's arms, buff from prison-yard workouts, are marked with tattoos signifying his affiliation with one of LA's many Crip sets as well as his identification as a Tongan. Outside his rented house on the outskirts of the capital city, boys dressed in wraparound skirts and finely woven waist mats are beginning to return home from school. As they chase a robust pig digging for food in the middle of the muddy dirt road in front of the house, the disparity between G-Money's experiences as a Tongan youth in Los Angeles and the lives of the young men passing are intriguingly apparent. In his XXXL royal-blue T-shirt, khaki Dickies shorts, and matching Chuck Taylor shoes, G-Money embodies an LA gangsta, specifically, a Tonga Crip Gangsta (TCG). Unlike the lives of the bucolic youths in the street, G-Money's adolescence was one of excessive violence and ethnic loyalty: To be from a gang that you have so much pride. . . . Especially a gang that's supposed to represent your creed, your ethnicity. I'm a Tonga Crip. If someone says fuck Tonga Crips, they are like saying fuck my race and they are saying fuck the Crips. It gives you even more endurance, more motivation. It's like, man . . . I'm a patriot. Do I have pride or not? You have people with so much dedication and loyalty, you know. You throw ""Tongan"" up into it, and that's one more motivation to be like, man? That's like sayin' ""Fuck my momma."" As a result of his involvement in gangs ,G-Money spent extended time in juvenile hall, leading to incarceration shortly aft er his eighteenth birthday, eventually resulting in G-Money's deportation back to Tonga and the people he had so actively sought to represent in the hood. His affiliation with TCG ran deeper than the bonds and security he found in the gang alongside other Tongan youth whose families had also migrated to the same violent landscape in inner-city South Los Angeles. Th e gang off ered a platform through which G-Money and his peers were able to give voice and meaning to their experiences in the multiple cultural worlds they traversed. As immigrant youth like G-Money experience racism, cultural marginalization, poverty, and urban decay, they articulate their shared experiences and negotiate culture and ethnicity through gangs and violent, hypermasculine identities. Th e proliferation of gangs, John Hagedorn states, ""is clearly related to familiar economic and social changes now associated with globalization-urbanization, immigration and social marginalization"" (2007, xxv). Th rough what Manuel Castells refers to as ""resistance identities"" (1997, 8), displaced, marginalized youth make powerful statements about gender, modernity, and globalization through enacting hypermasculine and racialized identities through gangs. One must, however, avoid essentializing such experiences and identities, since clearly gang members like G-Money inhabit multiple social worlds and multiple identities. G-Money holds both LA Crip and Tongan nationalist identities through the gang and is involved in the dynamic process of redefining each. ""It is not just that collective identities and ways of life are created, but that they are internally contested, that their boundaries are porous and overlapping, and that people live in more than one at the same time"" (Calhoun 1995, 47). The cross-cultural popularity of gangsta culture rests in its ability to articulate shared experiences and to confront cultural and social marginalization (see Alonso 2004; Hagedorn 2007; and Quinn 2005). Eithne Quinn explains that while gangsta is a kind of dissident, everyday political culture, it is also a hypervisible commercial form, making it a powerful and compelling image in the lives of youth. ""It both contains common subversions of authority predicated on a history of discrimination and off ers a highly commodifiable brand of youth and race rebellion"" (2005, 23). It is ""a simplified code-young males' obsession with power and prowess,"" Ward Keeler further adds, that makes gangs, gang imagery, and gangsta music so appealing and transportable across cultural boundaries (2008). Gang culture is the embodiment of a violent masculinity, and owing to the bloodshed associated with gangs, it operates as both an extremely meaningful medium and, simultaneously, a destructive force in the lives of many youth. My research examines the early and formative experiences and narratives of those migrant youths who ""do not make it"" in the United States: those youths who find themselves involved in gangs and in and out of the juvenile court system, serve time in jail and prison, and ultimately are forcefully removed from the United States through deportation to Tonga. In examining the construction of gang identities, masculinity, and youth culture among Tongan male adolescents, I seek to address how young people's positions in socially, racially, and economically marginalized communities in the United States are generative of certain discourses of masculine identity that make gang membership meaningful.

Based on the results of three searches, 386 studies were retrieved and coded. Comparisons were made across all LGB individuals (138 studies), between LGB and heterosexual individuals (65 studies), and between LGB females and males (53 studies), with over 500,000 participants. Multiple types of victimization were coded, including discrimination, physical assault, and school victimization. Findings revealed that for LGB individuals, reports of victimization experiences were substantial (e.g., 55% experienced verbal harassment, and 41% experienced discrimination) and some types have increased since a 1992 review, while others have decreased. LGB individuals experienced greater rates of victimization than heterosexual individuals (range: d=.04-.58). LGB males experienced some types of victimization more than LGB females (e.g., weapon assault and being robbed) but, overall, the gender differences were small. It can be concluded that LGB individuals still experience a substantial amount of victimization. Implications for research methods are discussed, including recommendations for sampling and measurement of victimization. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

Here, we examined the role of the hippocampus in memory for target and context. Thirty-five patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 35 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and education participated in the study. Participants completed visual letter detection and auditory tone discrimination target tasks, while also viewing a series of briefly presented urban and natural scenes. For the measurement of hippocampal and cerebral cortical volume, we utilized the FreeSurfer protocol using a Siemens Trio 3T scanner. Before the quantification of brain volumes, hippocampal atrophy was confirmed by visual inspection in each patient. Results revealed intact letter recall and tone discrimination performances in aMCI patients, whereas they showed severe impairments in the recognition of scenes presented together with the targets. Patients with aMCI showed bilaterally reduced hippocampal volumes, but intact cortical volume, as compared with the controls. In controls and in the whole sample, hippocampal volume was positively associated with scene recognition when a target task was present. This relationship was observed in both visual and auditory conditions. Scene recognition and target tasks were not associated with executive functions. These results suggest that the hippocampus plays an essential role in the formation of memory traces of the visual environment when people concurrently perform a target task at behaviorally relevant points in time. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","adult; amnesia; article; auditory discrimination; brain atrophy; brain cortex; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; executive function; female; hippocampus; human; male; mental performance; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; recognition; task performance; visual stimulation","Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; Hippocampus; Memory; Rapid serial visual presentation; Visual scene","","","","Masson SpA","","","","","","English","Cortex","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Peter Fry et al.'s Dangerous Divisions: Racial Politics in Contemporary Brazil (2007) includes a number of opinion pieces by both scholars and activists against university affirmative action. On the other hand, sociologists such as Antonio Guimarães (2001) and Sales Augusto dos Santos (2006) support the programs. North American scholar Seth Racusen (2010) proposes a novel approach with a schema that would consider both class and race in university affirmative action. Much of the debate focuses on Brazilian racial identity and why the policy is inappropriate. There is also a focus on class, and the fact that Brazil's primary and secondary public schools are inadequate, and most of those attending these schools are Afro-Brazilian. For this reason, opponents of affirmative action believe resources should be allocated to improving public schools rather than supporting university affirmative action. What is lost in most scholarship concerned with affirmative action is an examination of political opinions of those who would potentially benefit from such policies. This chapter examines determinants of Afro-Brazilian support of affirmative action. I focus on respondents in Salvador and São Paulo. My hypothesis is that Afro-Brazilians who believe blacks (negros) face difficulties in society due to racism and discrimination claim a black identification, and the highly educated are more likely to support affirmative-action policy than those who do not acknowledge racism as a major problem for blacks, who claim nonblack identifications, and are less educated. Previous research has shown that Afro-Brazilians who claim a black identification are more likely to vote for black candidates (G. Mitchell 2010a), and that those who identify as a black racial group tend to vote for black candidates (G. Mitchell 2009). Because Black Movement activists tend to be middle-class (Hanchard 1994; Burdick 1998), I believe those with higher education will support the policy more than those with lower education. The alternative hypothesis is that Afro-Brazilians with higher levels of education are more likely not to support affirmative-action policies than those with lower levels of education. Perhaps people with higher education believe they were successful based on merit, and that merit only should be considered for university admission rather than one's racial background. In fact, Stanley R. Bailey and Edward E. Telles (2006) find that among negros (pretos and pardos) and brancos there is less support for quotas in employment and in universities as education increases. Those with higher education are less likely to support affirmative action than those with lower education. Bailey and Telles use large-scale survey data collected in 2000 in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Gislene Aparecida dos Santos's (2008) interviews reveal that Afro-Brazilian high school students are less supportive of affirmative-action programs for Afro-Brazilians, and most prefer that the policy be class-based. However, she also finds that Afro-Brazilian university students, through outreach, encourage Afro-Brazilian high school students to consider university admission under affirmative-action programs because it is a right granted to them as citizens. These students oftentimes begin to claim a black identification after attending university. Andrew Francis and Turrini-Pinto (2009) find that at the University of Brasilia, candidates for admission misrepresent their color to be considered for university affirmative action. However, using a survey, Bailey (2008) finds that nearly half of racially mixed Brazilians would choose white over black racial classifications if forced to choose one. He also finds that using photographs where respondents can determine if an individual is eligible for quotas for blacks (negros), most respondents do not believe those of lighter and medium skin tones deserve inclusion in the quotas. In fact, for the photographs of individuals with medium skin tone, 60 percent of mulattos do not find them deserving of quota inclusion. Nonetheless, Bailey also finds that in an experiment, simply mentioning a racial policy for negros increases the percentage of those identifying as such. These findings appear counterintuitive, but I believe that as in the University of Brasília case, when faced with the real-life choice of benefiting from affirmative action, some candidates for university admission will in fact change or misrepresent their identification to benefit from the program. I do not intend to contribute to the literature on changing racial identification to benefit from affirmative action. Rather, I am interested in the determinants of support for affirmative action among Afro-Brazilians, and hope to contribute to social-science literature on political opinion and behavior of Afro-Brazilians. This chapter focuses on Afro-Brazilians in Salvador and São Paulo, Brazil, exclusively. I examine whether support of affirmative-action policy is related to sociodemographic factors such as Afro-Brazilians' educational level, age, gender, income, color identification, and opinions about the major problems blacks (negros) face in Brazil. Presumably, respondents attributing blacks' problems to racism and discrimination might support racial policies aimed at reducing discrimination. Juliet Hooker, in Race and the Politics of Solidarit (2009), notes that political solidarity is racialized and shaped by race despite the fact that scholars of multicultural theories often do not discuss racialized solidarity. In the case of the United States, there are huge disparities between whites' and blacks' political opinions regarding racial injustice and racial inequality, Hooker posits that there are also differences in support for racial policies because of differential sympathy. She states, ""As a result of racialization, the pain and suffering of nonwhites are either rendered invisible or, when visible, are seen as less deserving of empathy and redress than those of whites (2009, 40). While Hooker's work is largely theoretical and focuses on Afro-descended and indigenous communities in Nicaragua, her point regarding empathy and solidarity is well taken. This chapter only focuses on Afro-descendants and does not presume solidarity. On the contrary, I assume differences exist among Afro-Brazilians in terms of racial identification and political opinion. Examining responses about the major problem of blacks allows me to analyze differential sympathy, especially when noted by acknowledging difficulties blacks face because of race rather than simply class. More importantly, I will examine how a respondent's opinion about the major problem of blacks and sociodemographic factors impact their support for affirmative action. Throughout this chapter Afro-Brazilians are synonymous with Afro-descendants.

Historical data used for supervised learning may contain discrimination, for instance, with respect to gender. The question addressed by discrimination-aware techniques is, given sensitive attribute, how to train discrimination-free classifiers on such historical data that are discriminative, with respect to the given sensitive attribute. Existing techniques that deal with this problem aim at removing all discrimination and do not take into account that part of the discrimination may be explainable by other attributes. For example, in a job application, the education level of a job candidate could be such an explainable attribute. If the data contain many highly educated male candidates and only few highly educated women, a difference in acceptance rates between woman and man does not necessarily reflect gender discrimination, as it could be explained by the different levels of education. Even though selecting on education level would result in more males being accepted, a difference with respect to such a criterion would not be considered to be undesirable, nor illegal. Current state-of-the-art techniques, however, do not take such gender-neutral explanations into account and tend to overreact and actually start reverse discriminating, as we will show in this paper. Therefore, we introduce and analyze the refined notion of conditional non-discrimination in classifier design. We show that some of the differences in decisions across the sensitive groups can be explainable and are hence tolerable. Therefore, we develop methodology for quantifying the explainable discrimination and algorithmic techniques for removing the illegal discrimination when one or more attributes are considered as explanatory. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world classification datasets demonstrates that the new techniques are superior to the old ones in this new context, as they succeed in removing almost exclusively the undesirable discrimination, while leaving the explainable differences unchanged, allowing for differences in decisions as long as they are explainable. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.","Crime; Data mining; Decision making; Algorithmic techniques; Automated decision making; Classification datasets; Experimental evaluation; Gender discrimination; Independence; Sensitive attribute; State-of-the-art techniques; Classification (of information)","Classification; Discrimination-aware data mining; Independence","","","","Springer London","","","","","","English","Knowl.

Results: Vowel intelligibility within each speaking style and the size of the clear speech benefit varied widely among talkers. The clear speech benefit was equivalent to that enjoyed by young listeners with normal hearing in an earlier study. Most talkers who had produced a clear speech benefit for young listeners with normal hearing also did so for the older listeners with hearing loss in the present study. However, effects of talker gender differed between listeners with normal hearing and listeners with hearing loss.

Results show a significantly higher detection rate for speakers who produce a higher fundamental frequency when being intoxicated, and a higher success rate for listeners who show a general preference for choosing the stimulus with higher fundamental frequency. However, human listeners do not consistently exploit this acoustic cue, since a simple algorithm which always classifies the stimulus with higher fundamental frequency as intoxicated would lead to a better performance of 82% discrimination rate.

This tension underlies contention around different approaches to clinical practice and gender variance. In medicine generally, relationships between clinicians and their clients have changed dramatically over the last 50 years in Western societies, as have sociological conceptions of those relationships. In the 1950s, the dominant model was Parsons’ ‘sick role’ - the patient passively accepting medical authority. Now the emphasis is on autonomous clients or ‘consumers’ who actively organise their health, and the medical clinician is only one source of information, albeit with regulated powers to prescribe medical interventions (Rogers and Pilgrim 2005). There is much at stake for psychiatric professionals whose work concerns gender variance. They defend psychiatry’s professional dominance over treatment of gender variance from incursions by other professions and by trans clients. Their defence necessarily centres on maintaining the mental illness diagnosis. In knowledge production about aetiology, psychiatry is defending its approach against neurology and the claims of trans clients. Psychiatry deploys diagnostic categories to control and contain its clients, creating order out of a chaotic, multi-dimensional field of behaviour. However, this way of managing difference is increasingly resisted by clients. This is not unique to gender variance - there is similar resistance as psychiatry seeks to extend psycho-pathologisation to many previously ŉormal’ emotional states such as sadness (Horwitz and Wakefield 2007). These general changes in power relations between health professionals and their clients contribute to an ongoing paradigm shift in treatment of trans people from the gate-keeping or mainstream model to the collaborative or gender variance model (Lev 2004). In gate-keeping, the clinician’s role is to restrict access to the package of surgical and hormonal treatment known as Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS)2 only to those people who meet the diagnostic criteria for pathology. In collaboration, the clinician and client together determine the most appropriate gender outcome.3 These models rely on conceptions of trans that arise from different knowledge bases. While psychiatry sees psycho-pathology that can sometimes be ameliorated by SRS, social disciplines see an atypical variation in lived experience and subjection to social exclusion and discrimination. Knowledge construction about aetiology and treatment is based on the interaction of trans people’s narratives and activism, clinician-researchers’ work in a range of disciplines, and a narrow set of biological and neurological research. As there are few researchers and no largescale comparative studies, there is not a strong empirical basis for either consensus on aetiology, or a move to an evidence-based medicine approach to treatment. The shift in treatment models is compatible with, and partially informed by, a shift in aetiological paradigms from trans as a disorder of psychosocial origin to trans as a healthy variation, whether of psychosocial, biological or biopsychosocial origin. Nurture/nature debates in the past have pitted social researchers against biological researchers and have divided trans people. However, I argue that agreement on variance of sex, gender and sexuality as healthy creates possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration with trans people around a biopsychosocial model of diversity. The shifting aetiological and treatment paradigms lead many trans people and some clinicians to argue for moving trans people’s health care out of psychiatry’s domain - focused on removing or reforming the Gender Identity Disorder (GID) diagnosis in the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This paradigm shift is developing largely through inter- and intra-professional struggles, with trans people applying pressure upon professional institutions - resisted by some significant leaders. These movements align closely with shifts in other medical domains. Voices within mental health professions have strongly challenged the dominance of diagnosis (Boyle 2007). Patient movements have organised against the stigma of diagnoses, especially mental health ones, and other health and social movements such as those around HIV/AIDS have significantly influenced clinical research and scientific knowledge construction. The potential shift in power relations away from psychiatry and towards trans people is illustrated by the impact of trans activism on treatment modalities and aetiological research, in a complex process involving coexisting, competing networks of trans people, clinicians and researchers. To structure discussion, I simplify this field by framing these as contending forces.4 On one side are advocates for a biological aetiology for trans and advocates for a queer idea of gender as fluid, who both argue for depathologisation and recognition of gender diversity. On the other side are highly influential clinicians who maintain a psychological disorder model of trans and a dichotomous, normative view of gender. In between are clinicians and others who seek a compromise that reforms the psychiatric diagnosis to reduce negative impacts of pathologisation and stigmatisation. By analysing published work and interview material, I developed heuristic positions to describe these groupings. Activists and researchers who work in a neurological paradigm form the healthy biological variation (HBV) position. Activists, clinicians and social theorists working in a social research paradigm form the transgender activism-social research (TA-SR) position. The middle-ground clinicians (MGC) balance between psychiatry, biological and social research and trans people’s self-identification. Clinicians who strongly maintain the psychiatric emphasis on diagnosis form the psychological disorder (PD) position. These constructed positions are intended to assist analysis, not to substitute reified description for social reality. Outside of this framing, other forces oppose any surgical or hormonal treatment (the anti-SRS position) or leave all decisions up to consumer choice. This chapter is based on doctoral research examining the social and political impacts of the ‘brain sex’ theory of trans. Below, I draw on semi-structured qualitative interviews with biological researchers, psychiatric and other clinician- researchers, social scientists and trans advocates. When I quote from an interview, I provide the person’s name and use single quote marks for those participants who preferred to be identified by a pseudonym.5 In the following analysis of clinical approaches to gender and identity, I am motivated by broad questions. How do clinicians and trans people act on knowledge to manage the trans body? How do battles over aetiological theory affect clinical practice and power relations? The questions I can actually address are more narrow, aiming to illuminate the strategic possibilities for trans people in this complex field. How have clinicians acted on the mainstream model of clinical practice for ‘treating’ trans people? How is that model and those practices changing? What are the implications for the availability of treatments for a wider range of trans people? How do the aetiological paradigms and disciplinary frameworks impact on a shift to a less stigmatising and pathologising approach, in particular proposals to reform or drop the DSM diagnosis of GID? These lead back to an overarching question - how central are the struggles over knowledge claims to social actors?. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Lenore Manderson.","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","English","Technologies of Sexuality, Identity and Sexual Health","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data. © 2011 The Author(s).","Data mining; Economic and social effects; Algorithmic solutions; Data preprocessing technique; Decision process; Preprocessing; Preprocessing techniques; Sensitive attribute; Two-class classification problems; Unobserved features; Classification (of information)","Classification; Discrimination-aware data mining; Preprocessing","","","","Springer London","","","","","","English","Knowl.

Objects can be categorized at varying levels of specificity: the superordinate (e.g. animal), the basic (e.g. dog), or the subordinate (e.g. Border Collie). We tested whether superordinate and more specific categorization depend on different spatial frequency ranges, and whether any such dependencies might be revealed by or influence signals recorded using EEG. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency (TF) analysis to examine the time course of object processing while participants performed either a grammatical gender-classification task (which generally forces basic-level categorization) or a living/non-living judgement (superordinate categorization) on everyday, real-life objects. Objects were filtered to contain only HSF or LSF. We found a greater positivity and greater negativity for HSF than for LSF pictures in the P1 and N1 respectively, but no effects of task on either component. A later, fronto-central negativity (N350) was more negative in the gender-classification task than the superordinate categorization task, which may indicate that this component relates to semantic or syntactic processing. We found no significant effects of task or spatial frequency on evoked or total gamma band responses.

To assess whether the Constitution succeeds in achieving this goal, we must consider the role played by Japan’s Supreme Court. The Court holds final authority to judge cases involving conflicts between individuals who assert beliefs or engage in behavior unacceptable to government authorities and government efforts to impose discipline against them. The Court is also charged with the constitutional mandate to prohibit discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of race, gender and other classifications. Japan’s progress toward achieving a free and open society relies heavily on the Court’s work in these areas. In this chapter, we examine rulings of the Court in cases that feature conflicts between individuals and the state. To begin, we consider a landmark case in which the Court ruled in favor of a minority group that claimed to be victims of discrimination.

Women were recruited through community centers in a major metropolitan city and represented a diversity of ethnicities. In total, 26 women who identified racially as Black (mean age = 26 years) participated in 6 focus groups, which explored body ideals, societal messages, cultural values, racism, and sexism. Narrative data from the focus groups were analyzed using grounded theory. The central category, Body/Self Image, was informed by perceptions of and feelings about not only weight and shape but also hair, skin, and attitude. Three additional categories, each with multiple properties, emerged: Interpersonal Influences, Experiences of Oppression, and Media Messages. These categories interact to explain the central category of Body/Self Image, and an emergent theory is presented. © 2013 American Psychological Association.","Adult; African Americans; Body Dysmorphic Disorders; Body Image; European Continental Ancestry Group; Gender Identity; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Mass Media; Prejudice; Qualitative Research; Race Relations; Social Identification; Socialization; Young Adult; adult; African American; article; body dysmorphic disorder; body image; Caucasian; ethnology; gender identity; human; human relation; mass medium; prejudice; psychological aspect; qualitative research; social behavior; social problem; socialization; young adult","African American; Body image; Gender; Grounded theory; Race","","","","","","","","","","English","J.

SCL was lower in the 40s and 60s age groups; however, the pattern of incremental increase with higher demand was consistent for heart rate and SCL across all age groups. Although each measure was quite sensitive at the group level, considering both SCL and heart rate improved detection of periods of heightened cognitive demand at the individual level.Conclusion: The data provide clear evidence that two basic physiological measures can be utilized under field conditions to differentiate multiple levels of objectively defined changes in cognitive demand. Methodological considerations, including task engagement, may account for some of the inconsistencies in previous research.Application: These findings increase the confidence with which these measures may be applied to assess relative differences in mental workload when developing and optimizing human machine interface (HMI) designs and in exploring their potential role in advanced workload detection and augmented cognition systems. © 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Adult; Aged; Automobile Driving; Cognition; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Man-Machine Systems; Memory; Middle Aged; Skin Temperature; Task Performance and Analysis; Workload; Young Adult; Automobile drivers; Design; Heart; Managers; Physiology; Sensitivity analysis; Heart rates; Mental workload; Skin conductance; verbal response; Working memories; adult; aged; article; car driving; clinical trial; cognition; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; heart rate; human; male; man machine interaction; memory; middle aged; physiology; randomized controlled trial; skin temperature; task performance; workload; Physiological models","heart rate; mental workload; skin conductance; verbal response; working memory; workload manager","","","Santos Family Foundation; U.S. Department of Transportation’s Region I New England University Transportation Center; Ford Motor Company; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (NEUTC)","","","","","","","English","Hum.

South Africa was not simply an innocent bystander in this shift; rather, its own dramatic defeat of state racism was a potent symbol of rights’ seemingly inevitable progress. And, in 1996, two years after the apartheid regime ended, South Africa adopted one of the most liberal constitutions in the world, enshrining non-discrimination on the basis of gender as well as sexual orientation. In this optimistic climate, ‘rights’ became lauded as a key catalyst in the fight against apartheid’s legacy and gender inequalities underpinning an HIV pandemic that by 2000 had left one in four pregnant women HIV positive. Indeed gender rights became viewed as a central mediator between the social and the sexual. It is important to stress at the outset that the term ‘rights’ is used deliberately loosely in this chapter. The intention is not to evaluate the effectiveness of new institutions and laws aimed at promoting gender equality after apartheid; although these questions are very important, they are already the focal point of much debate. This chapter is principally concerned with how women employ rights narratives to espouse equality and renegotiate femininities and intimate relations with men. As a consequence, some of the rights described may not look like rights at all, but more like obligations, moral codes, or expectations, ones embedded in seemingly mundane everyday practices. Yet rights have never been hermetically sealed entities. The isiZulu verb ukulunga, from which amalungelo (rights) derives, is actually more akin to the phrase ‘to be right, ' and therefore has a wider meaning than its modern cousin. One dictionary, for instance, defines ukulunga as: ‘Get or be in order, fit correct, be as it should be… be morally good, be righteous’ (Doke et. al., 1990, p. 469). In understanding rights today, therefore, it is important to adopt a more historical framework than rights being simply seen as absent during apartheid and then introduced to fight patriarchy afterwards. What follows is based on ethnographic research on HIV/AIDS, gender, and intimacy, conducted mainly in a former ‘African’ township and informal settlement in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province from 2000-2006.1 The area-Mandeni-is about one and a half hour’s drive north of Durban on South Africa’s East coast. Until the 1950s, it was predominantly a rural area, containing a mix of ‘tribal’ land and white-owned sugar cane farms. In 1954, however, the opening of a large paper mill motivated the construction of a formal township for African workers (Sundumbili) and a smaller town for white workers (Mandini). But industrialisation really took off in the area after 1971. In this year, Isithebe Industrial Park was opened by the apartheid state as part of its strategy to prevent migration to larger urban areas; the park came to employ 23, 000 people in 1990, although employment shrunk significantly in the late 1990s and 2000s due to trade liberalisation. Surrounding the industrial park and township are large informal settlements, home especially to migrants from rural KwaZulu-Natal. First, some introductory remarks concerning the relevance of what follows to postcolonial societies. One important dispute that repeatedly surfaces in former colonies is whether liberal ‘rights’-for example same-sex rights or gender rights-are outside pollutants or vital modernising interventions. In South Africa, as well as in many other parts of the continent, one history of this rights/tradition dichotomy lies in the colonial authority’s adoption of a system of governance called ‘indirect rule.' Under this system, settler authorities sought to co-opt chiefs to rule ‘tribal’ areas. This process, however, went hand in hand with the introduction of modern legal rights in certain domains. And these twin systems of rule left a legacy, as the Comaroff & Comaroff (2004, p. 189) describe, whereby ‘built into the very scaffolding of all post colonies’ is both a modernist culture of rights-based legality and simultaneously the ability of citizens to make powerful claims through evoking cultural difference. Gender permeates, and is constructed by, institutions and categories that work through this rights/tradition binary. One reason the South African women’s movement advocated modern rights so strongly in the 1990s, the time of political transition, is because chiefs and other representatives of ‘tradition’ so clearly sought to tie male power to the flag of tradition (see Hassim, 2006). And, as Linzi Manicom (2005, p. 32, 34) notes, during South Africa’s democratisation process, political liberalism and feminist discourses converged in powerful ways as women were incorporated into the new democracy as gendered liberal citizens. The ‘grammar of liberal democracy, ' she argues, produces '… gendered political subjects in ways that emphasise gender over other contending social identifications.' Rights, then, are not only imposed from outside by Western agencies (although this certainly can happen); liberalism is both a vocabulary inseparable from democratisation and one that resonates with deep-seated institutional legacies which exist in many postcolonial societies. A second introductory point is that recent political economy forces yielded major gendered shifts in South Africa, and indeed elsewhere on the continent, that mold-while are constructed by-today’s embrace of rights. From the 1940s, as the anti-colonial movement gained ground, an ambitious project of ‘development’ became ascendant in many parts of Africa and extended into the postcolonial era. Leading the way to a modern industrial future was typically the gendered figure of ‘industrial man’ (Cooper, 2003). The contrast today, however, is stark. It is difficult to generalise, but the ascendancy in the 1980s of World Bank/IMF sponsored ‘structural adjustment’ programmes underscored a significant turn to the market; moreover, increasingly footloose capital now interacts in a more selective way with many parts of Africa, including its southern tip. James Ferguson (2006) recently described poignantly the growth of heavily militarised mineral-extraction enclaves that stand aloof from national societies and their indebted economies. In this scenario, many young men are unlikely to enter either manufacturing or state employment, a scenario that transforms the foundations of gender relations. Turning to South Africa, while the country still has a large industrial economy, after independence the ruling African National Congress combined welfare interventions with free-market economic policies. One consequence is that the post-apartheid period witnessed the rapid rise of a socially and geographically mobile multi-racial middle class able to realise democracy’s promise of improving living standards. At the same time, unemployment rates increased rapidly among young people. Unemployment began to increase in the 1980s, but from 1995 to 2005 rose by 12 percent to 72 percent for 15-24 year old women and by 11 percent to 58 percent for men of the same age (Department of Labour, 2006, p. 18). Another related trend, initiated earlier but propelled by the unemployment crisis, is the dramatic reduction in the number of adults who are married; this figure halved in the last four decades among Africans to 30 percent today (see Hunter, 2010). As a consequence of these developments the longstanding ‘patriarchal bargain’ (Kandiyoti, 1988) based on marriage stumbled; most young men today do not work or provide material support or housing for women, and a greater number of women move (often involving a geographical move) into the labour force, typically into informal work. Drawing on interviews and informal discussions, the two women’s claims, that they have a right to sexual pleasure/safe-sex and to have multiple intimate partners, show how moral justifications (rights versus wrongs) are shifting through women’s encounters with daily life, and men, after apartheid. They suggest that ‘rights’ today cannot be measured in simply a quantitative way whereby, if they falter, more are simply needed. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Peter Aggleton, Paul Boyce, Henrietta L.

In the present day, it is notable that the majority of those who discriminate against the elderly are young people. For this reason, the study was conducted with a cross-sectional design in order to identify university students' views on ageism and ageism practices. The sample of the study was comprised of students selected by means of stratified random sampling in proportion with the size. 378 students (203 women, 175 men) participated in the study. The questionnaire form prepared by the researchers was used as a data collection tool. An analysis of the students' views in terms of gender revealed that the students most frequently identified the statement ""addressing the elderly with names like 'senile', 'old chap', 'old man""' (female: 94.1%, male: 88.6%) and the statement ""ignoring old people's experiences"" (female: 86.2%, male: 85.7%) as discrimination. The difference between all student views was not found to be significant in terms of gender (p > 0.05). When the students' state of practicing ageist behaviors was analyzed, it was found out that students in general did not practise ""addressing old people with names like 'senile', 'old chap', 'old man'"" (female: 94.1%, male: 92.0%) and ""helping old people with their packages"" (female: 92.6%, male: 97.7%). It was determined that students most frequently applied the behavior ""teasing old people wearing highly colourful clothes"" (female: 87.2%, male: 85.1%). Only the difference in the behavior of ""not helping old people with their packages"" was found to be significant in terms of gender (p < 0.05). It was discovered that students mostly viewed statements related to ageism as discrimination, and in the same way the majority displayed ageist behavior. It is assumed that the identification of young people's views on ageism and their practices of ageism will shed light on future practices aiming to equip them with positive attitudes and an egalitarian point of view towards ageism and help them develop their own ideas, behavior and attitudes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","Ageism; Attitude; Discrimination; Perception of the elderly; Young people","","","","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","English","Ageing Int.","Article","Final","","Scopus"

As with other forms of prejudice and discrimination, it functions to maintain status and power differences between groups in society. One manifestation of sexism involves prejudice and discrimination against girls and women who seek to achieve in prestigious fields traditionally associated with males. Another manifestation of sexism, however, occurs when pressures are placed on boys and men to conform to traditional conceptions of masculinity. Over the last two decades, an increasing number of developmental and educational psychologists have become concerned about sexism directed toward children and adolescents in school contexts. Our chapter reviews the research on this topic. After providing an overview of different processes related to sexism, we examine how it is manifested in school contexts. Sexism is seen through gender-stereotyped biases against girls and boys in academic and athletic achievement. Also, it occurs through sexual harassment in social interactions. We also address factors related to children's awareness of sexism and coping responses to sexism. Finally, we consider possible ways to reduce sexism and foster effective coping in schools. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Achievement; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Awareness; Child; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Power (Psychology); Schools; Sexism; Sexual Harassment; Social Distance; Social Environment; Social Identification; Socialization; Stereotyping; achievement; adaptive behavior; adolescent; adult; awareness; behavior; child; comparative study; female; gender identity; human; male; psychological aspect; review; school; sexism; sexual harassment; social behavior; social distance; social environment; socialization; stereotyping","Academic achievement; Athletic participation; Media; Parents; Peers; Schools; Sex-role attitudes; Sexism; Sexual harassment; Teachers","","","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","English","Adv.

However, the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial showed that hyperprolacti nemia occurred in a significant proportion of drug-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients, which shows that it may also be caused by other factors, including genetic predisposition. Therefore, we investigated the functional polymorphism of the prolactin gene in schizophrenic patients compared with control subjects. Method: The experimental group consisted of 403 patients with schizophrenia: 202 females and 201 males. The control group consisted of 653 subjects: 377 females and 276 males. The functional polymorphism -1149 G/T (rs1341239) of the prolactin gene was genotyped using the TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism allelic discrimination method. Results: The distribution of genotypes in schizophrenic patients was significantly different from those of the control subjects (p = 0.031). After breaking down by gender, for male patients, the difference versus control males was significant for both genotypes and alleles (p = 0.031 and p = 0.002, respectively), with allele G being observed more frequently in schizophrenic patients. Conclusion: The results may suggest a possible abnormality of the functional -1149 G/T polymorphism of the prolactin gene in schizophrenia, especially in male patients, similar to that found in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This could also correspond with an autoimmune pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Copyright © 2011 S.

Development of risk prediction models for colorectal cancer in Korean men and women is urgently needed to enhance its prevention and early detection. Methods: Gender specific five-year risk prediction models were developed for overall colorectal cancer, proximal colon cancer, distal colon cancer, colon cancer and rectal cancer. The model was developed using data from a population of 846,559 men and 479,449 women who participated in health examinations by the National Health Insurance Corporation. Examinees were 30-80 years old and free of cancer in the baseline years of 1996 and 1997. An independent population of 547,874 men and 415,875 women who participated in 1998 and 1999 examinations was used to validate the model. Model validation was done by evaluating its performance in terms of discrimination and calibration ability using the C-statistic and Hosmer-Lemeshow-type chi-square statistics. Results: Age, body mass index, serum cholesterol, family history of cancer, and alcohol consumption were included in all models for men, whereas age, height, and meat intake frequency were included in all models for women. Models showed moderately good discrimination ability with C-statistics between 0.69 and 0.78. The C-statistics were generally higher in the models for men, whereas the calibration abilities were generally better in the models for women. Conclusions: Colorectal cancer risk prediction models were developed from large-scale, population-based data. Those models can be used for identifying high risk groups and developing preventive intervention strategies for colorectal cancer. © 2014 Shin et al.","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Calibration; Colorectal Neoplasms; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; cholesterol; adult; age; aged; alcohol consumption; article; blood level; body mass; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; controlled study; family history; female; follow up; food intake; gastroenterological procedure; human; Korea; major clinical study; male; meat; medical service; middle aged; national health insurance; outcome assessment; prediction; process development; risk assessment; risk factor; risk prediction model; validation process; very elderly; calibration; Colorectal Neoplasms; epidemiology; factual database; health insurance; mortality; proportional hazards model; register; risk assessment; South Korea; validation study","","","cholesterol, 57-88-5","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The present study explores whether men who perceive manhood to be an impermanent state easily taken away by engaging in gender role violations (i.e., precarious manhood; Vandello et al. 2008) are less likely to react negatively to sexually prejudiced interaction partners and therefore less likely to confront sexual prejudice. In addition, we tested whether non-confrontation serves to affirm meta-perceptions of heterosexuality. To test this hypothesis, 88 heterosexual, young adult males, drawn from the undergraduate population of a university in the northeastern U.S., were randomly assigned to either pair with a confederate who expressed blatant sexual prejudice or no blatant prejudice toward a gay applicant in a hiring discussion. Consistent with predictions, precarious manhood predicted lower rates of confronting sexual prejudice, and less negative responses to their interaction partner, while confronting prejudice was associated with believing one would be viewed as gay regardless of individual differences in precarious manhood. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","","Confronting prejudice; Gender roles; Masculinity; Sexual prejudice","","","Rutgers University","Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","","","","","","English","Sex Roles","Article","Final","","Scopus"

From the beginning of her litigation strategy as the head of the ACLU Women's Rights Project, Ginsburg defined sex discrimination as the detrimental effects of gender stereotypes that constrained both men and women from living their lives as they wished-not solely the minority status of women. The same sex-based stereotypes that kept women out of the market sphere kept men out of the domestic sphere, and both were unlawful. Through a handful of key cases, Ginsburg challenged sex-based stereotypes that cast men as breadwinner and women as caregiver, succeeding in convincing the Supreme Court to establish a standard of heightened scrutiny for sex-based classifications.","","","","","","","","","","","","English","Hast.

Laws codify societal understandings of which factors are legitimate grounds for differential treatment (and when and in which contexts) - or are considered unfair discrimination, including gender, ethnicity or age. Discrimination-aware data mining (DADM) implements the hope that information technology supporting the decision process can also keep it free from unjust grounds. However, constraining data mining to exclude a fixed enumeration of potentially discriminatory features is insufficient. We argue for complementing it with exploratory DADM, where discriminatory patterns are discovered and flagged rather than suppressed. This article discusses the relative merits of constraint-oriented and exploratory DADM from a conceptual viewpoint. In addition, we consider the case of loan applications to empirically assess the fitness of both discrimination-aware data mining approaches for two of their typical usage scenarios: prevention and detection. Using Mechanical Turk, 215 US-based participants were randomly placed in the roles of a bank clerk (discrimination prevention) or a citizen / policy advisor (detection). They were tasked to recommend or predict the approval or denial of a loan, across three experimental conditions: discrimination-unaware data mining, exploratory, and constraint-oriented DADM (eDADM resp. cDADM). The discrimination-aware tool support in the eDADM and cDADM treatments led to significantly higher proportions of correct decisions, which were also motivated more accurately. There is significant evidence that the relative advantage of discrimination-aware techniques depends on their intended usage. For users focussed on making and motivating their decisions in non-discriminatory ways, cDADM resulted in more accurate and less discriminatory results than eDADM. For users focussed on monitoring for preventing discriminatory decisions and motivating these conclusions, eDADM yielded more accurate results than cDADM. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Decision support systems; Information technology; Motivation; Decision supports; Discrimination discovery and prevention; Evaluation; Mechanical turks; On-line experiments; User study; Data mining","Data mining for decision support; Discrimination discovery and prevention; Discrimination-aware data mining; Evaluation; Mechanical Turk; Online experiment; Responsible data mining; User studies","","","Flemish Agency for Innovation; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek— Vlaanderen, (100048); Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie, IWT","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","English","Artif Intell Law","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This activates a form of critique whose double focus on (1) shared conceptions of justice; and (2) structural sources of injustice, allows criteria of social justice to emerge from the identification of a broad pattern of societal injustice surpassing the discrimination of particular groups. In this light, women's victimization is but a symptom of structural dynamics negatively affecting also the alleged winners in the classical feminist agenda of critique.

The Capability Approach identifies three elements-functionings, capabilities, and agency-to analyze individual welfare. Functionings represent the achieved welfare of an individual: what a person manages to be or do in the different dimensions of human life. These ""beings"" and ""doings"" vary in a wide range of aspects, from being adequately nourished and in good health to more complex achievements like having self-confidence or walking without shame. Capabilities express the set of available functionings an individual has to choose from. They are the set of choices people have, or the freedom to choose the life they want (Sen 1985b, 1999). In turn, agency is the human capacity to determine one's life. It is by the free exercise of individual agency that people achieve valuable capabilities (welfare). In this context, development policy must be aimed to (re)create the institutional and social arrangements to guarantee this free exercise. By using Sen's approach, I thus accept the conceptual premise that human welfare is more about substantive freedoms enjoyed across multiple dimensions (valuable capabilities), and less about how much income a person has. Furthermore, I support the argument that cumulative development can best be achieved by expanding the range of individual freedoms, as they have instrumental value to achieving economic development, but most importantly, these freedoms have an intrinsic value in fostering human well-being. From this standpoint, this research conceptualizes human welfare as the achievement of valuable capabilities, and it seeks to analyze it in comparative perspective. Specifically, it seeks to understand welfare differences between Afro-Colombians and non-Afro-Colombians in two dimensions, namely ""knowledge"" and ""shelter"" capabilities. Its aim is to understand how ethnic and racial characteristics affect the achievement of welfare for individual members of the Afro-Colombian population vis-à-vis non-Afro-Colombians in the analyzed dimensions, beyond income levels or consumption patterns. The two dimensions of human welfare analyzed here were chosen for both their intrinsic and instrumental relevance. The ""knowledge capability,"" which represents the individual possibility to choose the level of knowledge and education a person wants and has reason to value, is translated into the functioning space (realized welfare) as years of education and training activities. In turn, these are closely linked to processes of social mobility, human capital accumulation, and economic growth. On the other hand, ""being properly sheltered,"" people's opportunity to chose their preferred shelter conditions, is an intrinsic aspect of human development that translates into the functioning space as having enough space, access to drinking water, and public-services infrastructure. These are also instrumental factors contributing to health and educational outcomes. Living in an overcrowded environment, a lack of drinking water, and unsafe construction materials are factors highly correlated with a number of health deficiencies and low academic performance.1 This paper also seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion about quantitative methods in the social sciences suitable to operationalize Amartya Sen's Capability Approach. By implementing a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to assess capabilities in two dimensions of human welfare, ""knowledge"" and ""being adequately sheltered,"" as latent constructs (Jöreskog and Goldberger 1975), this research seeks to develop a quantitative application of the Capability Approach. The aim of M I M IC is to capture how a set of exogenous variables (e.g., ethnicity, gender, or being poor) expand or contract a given capability dimension (e.g., ""knowledge""), which is assessed as an unobserved variable. In turn, that given capability determines specific outcomes or individual functioning achievements (e.g., achieved years of education). These individual functioning achievements are the set of indicators of the given latent construct. Although this technique does not allow the quantification of a capability dimension as such, it does allow the determination of what and how they are influenced, and in turn, which level of individual welfare a person is able to secure given the freedom or capability he or she enjoyed when choosing. Accordingly, lower-functioning achievement is associated with lower capability or less freedom, which in turn is caused by the interaction of factors such as age, gender, race, and location. The contrary also holds true. This methodology thus allows the identification of the impact of those factors over the knowledge and shelter capabilities, and in turn, how these impacts are translated into achieved welfare of an individual in the specific dimension. The study uses the 2003 Quality of Life Survey (ECV 2003 in Spanish)2 implemented by the National Department of Statistics in Colombia. The QLS 2003 was a survey designed to assess the socioeconomic conditions of the Colombian population with a sample of 24,090 households and 85,145 individuals, representative at the national level. Calculations were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS), and its procedure Covariance Analysis of Linear Structural Equation (CALIS). Historically, Afro-Colombians have been marginalized from the benefits of modernity and democracy. Socially excluded, they have the worst living conditions in comparative terms to the rest of the population (Arocha 1998; Urrea et al. 2005; Escobar 2003). They have the highest illiteracy rates in the country, 15.2 percent against 8.1 percent of non-Afro-Colombians, and health and housing indicators follow the same trend (Urrea et al. 2005). Under standard welfare analysis of group disparities, the deprived conditions of Afro-Colombians have been considered as the accumulated result of low income and class disparities. However, the persistence and magnitude of the racial gaps in the country suggest that practices of racial discrimination are limiting Afro-Colombians' individual agency. Moreover, the results obtained from the statistical application in this paper further support this argument (see tables 2 and 4).3 Consequently, it can be argued that systematic lower capability and functioning achievement for Afro-Colombians in relation to non-Afro-Colombians is to a large extent due to unyielding social practices of racial discrimination, and not only to class differences as has been traditionally argued. In this context, public policy must go beyond affirmative-action policies aimed at improving access to education, health, and housing. It is imperative to develop public policy toward increasing direct political participation, and to effectively enforce the rule of law, specifically the laws and treaties established to promote Afro-descendants' ethnic rights and to prevent discrimination against them. It is only by a successful combination of affirmative-action policies and the enforcement of the rule of law that Afro-Colombians could see their capabilities expanded. © 2012 by Michigan State University.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prediction model to guide decision-making by general practitioners, which estimates risk of one year all-cause mortality in patients with no obvious liver disease. Methods: In this population-based historical cohort study, biochemistry data from patients in Tayside, Scotland, with LFTs performed in primary care were record-linked to secondary care and prescription databases to ascertain baseline characteristics, and to mortality data. Using this derivation cohort a survival model was developed to predict mortality. The model was assessed for calibration, discrimination (using the C-statistic) and performance, and validated using a separate cohort of Scottish primary care practices. Results: From the derivation cohort (n = 95 977), 2.7% died within one year. Predictors of mortality included: age; male gender; social deprivation; history of cancer, renal disease, stroke, ischaemic heart disease or respiratory disease; statin use; and LFTs (albumin, transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyltransferase). The C-statistic for the final model was 0.82 (95% CI 0.80-0.84), and was similar in the validation cohort (n = 11 653) 0.86 (0.79-0.90). As an example of performance, for a 10% predicted probability cut-off, sensitivity = 52.8%, specificity = 94.0%, PPV = 21.0%, NPV = 98.5%. For the model without LFTs the respective values were 43.8%, 92.8%, 15.6%, 98.1%. Conclusions: The Algorithm for Liver Function Investigations (ALFI) is the first model to successfully estimate the probability of all-cause mortality in patients with no apparent liver disease having LFTs in primary care. While LFTs added to the model's discrimination and sensitivity, the clinical utility of ALFI remains to be established since LFTs did not improve an already high NPV for short term mortality and only modestly improved a very low PPV. © 2012 McLernon et al.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Calibration; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Liver Function Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Primary Health Care; Prognosis; Regression Analysis; Risk; Scotland; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; albumin; alkaline phosphatase; aminotransferase; bilirubin; gamma glutamyltransferase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adolescent; adult; aged; article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; drug use; female; general practitioner; human; ischemic heart disease; kidney disease; liver function test; major clinical study; male; medical history; mortality; neoplasm; prediction; primary medical care; respiratory tract disease; social isolation","","","alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; aminotransferase, 9031-66-7; bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; gamma glutamyltransferase, 85876-02-4","National Health Service Research & Development Programme Health Technology Assessment Programme; University of Dundee","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Few studies have provided normative data for this measure, and minimal data are available regarding the impact of sociodemographic factors on test scores. This study presents normative data for the BSIT in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic and non-Hispanic Whites. A Rasch analysis was also conducted to identify the items that best discriminated between varying levels of olfactory functioning, as measured by the BSIT. The total sample included 302 older adults seen as part of an ongoing study of rural cognitive aging, Project FRONTIER. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that BSIT scores require adjustment by age and gender, but years of education, ethnicity, and language did not significantly influence BSIT performance. Four items best discriminated between varying levels of smell identification, accounting for 59.44% of total information provided by the measure. However, items did not represent a continuum of difficulty on the BSIT. The results of this study indicate that the BSIT appears to be well-suited for assessing odor identification deficits in older adults of diverse backgrounds, but that fine-tuning of this instrument may be recommended in light of its items difficulty and discrimination parameters.

Shaping control devices differently is one method of coding control devices for easy tactual identification. However we still do not know how well people perceive complex shapes. The purpose of this study was to examine tactile discrimination of different geometrical shapes between males and females. Twenty-five Chinese people participated in a tactile symbol matching task. In each trial, participants were given one tactile symbol. They were asked to 'touch-read' the symbol with their thumb and index finger of dominant hand and then to match it with the target set placed in front of them as fast and as accurately as possible. The results showed that circle, square and triangle were discriminated significantly faster than other polygons and star shape patterns. Tactile symbols with less number of edges were recognized significantly faster than those with many edges. Tactile features consisting of acute edges were more easily discernible. Significant association between recognition accuracy and response time for geometric shapes was also revealed. The higher the recognition accuracy for a tactile symbol was, the shorter the response time. No significant difference between males and females was found in tactile shape discrimination. The findings of this study are useful as a reference for designers, ergonomists and other practitioners to develop better man-machine interfaces with tactual shape coding so as to improve human operator performance.","Man machine systems; SCADA systems; Technology transfer; Cutaneous sense; Gender; Shape discrimination; Tactual coding; Tactual display; Codes (symbols)","Cutaneous sense; Gender; Tactile shape discrimination; Tactual coding; Tactual display","","","","Newswood Limited","International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, IMECS 2014","113110","Kowloon","12 March 2014 through 14 March 2014","","English","Lect.

Yet, data publishing and mining do not come without dangers, namely privacy invasion and also potential discrimination of the individuals whose data are published. Discrimination may ensue from training data mining models (e.g. classifiers) on data which are biased against certain protected groups (ethnicity, gender, political preferences, etc.). The objective of this paper is to describe how to obtain data sets for publication that are: (i) privacy-preserving; (ii) unbiased regarding discrimination; and (iii) as useful as possible for learning models and finding patterns. We present the first generalization-based approach to simultaneously offer privacy preservation and discrimination prevention. We formally define the problem, give an optimal algorithm to tackle it and evaluate the algorithm in terms of both general and specific data analysis metrics (i.e. various types of classifiers and rule induction algorithms). It turns out that the impact of our transformation on the quality of data is the same or only slightly higher than the impact of achieving just privacy preservation. In addition, we show how to extend our approach to different privacy models and anti-discrimination legal concepts. © 2014 The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Data privacy; Anti-discrimination; Generalization; Information society; Optimal algorithm; Privacy invasions; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Rule induction algorithms; Data mining","Anti-discrimination; Data mining; Generalization; Privacy","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (NAGW-1331, NCCI-112)","Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","","","English","Data Min.

Relationships to perceived stress measures, however, have rarely been specifically investigated. A diverse sample of 135 adults participated in a study assessing relationships between chronic stress indicator CORT to perceived stress and health indicators. CORT was not correlated to single perceived domain indices but with a global stress composite. Differences in objective and subjective measures were found for sociodemographics: racial/ethnic identity, sex and socioeconomic status (SES). Race by SES interactions predicted both CORT and perceived stress, but produced a complex and partially unanticipated pattern of results. For minorities, low and high SES showed the highest CORT, with mid-SES showing the lowest CORT; there was little change in perceived stress at all levels of SES. For non-minorities, mid-SES showed the highest CORT, with decreases in both CORT and perceived stress in high SES. The unanticipated findings of deleterious outcomes for high SES minorities highlight the importance of investigating potential stressors and moderators, including perceived discrimination and social identity. Moreover, these results suggest that CORT may not always correlate with single stress indices but may provide a global assessment of chronic stress, with implications for the allostatic load literature.

In this paper, we present an idea of estimating the view angle of a test sample in advance so as to compare it with the corresponding training samples with the same or approximate viewpoint. In order to obtain reliable estimation results, the view-sensitive features should be extracted. We propose a novel and effective feature extraction method to characterize the silhouettes from different views. The discrimination power of this representation is also verified through experiments. Afterwards, the robust regression method is employed to estimate the viewpoint of gait. The view angles of test samples from BUAA-IRIP Gait Database are estimated with the regression models learned from CASIA Gait Database. Compared with the ground truth angles, such estimation is satisfactory with a small error level. Therefore, it can provide necessary help for gait application systems when the view angles of test data are uncertain. This point is verified experimentally through integrating the view angle estimation into a gait based gender classification system. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Feature extraction; Regression analysis; Application systems; Estimation results; Feature extraction methods; Gait; Gait recognition; Gender classification; Regression model; Robust regressions; Estimation","Gait; Gender classification; Robust regression; View estimation","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Basic Research Program of China, (2010CB327902); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61005016, 61061130560)","","","","","","","English","Multimedia Tools Appl","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Somatic disorders, social factors like unemployment, life events, such as financial loss or loss of significant others, previous suicide attempts, male gender, older age, and firearms are also risk factors for suicide. Unfortunately there are only few results about the impact of several risk factors on suicide and about differences in risk constellations in different regions and cultures. However, it is clear that suicide rarely occurs in the absence of mental disorder. Therefore, prevention, early identification, and appropriate treatment of mental disorders have to be the main components for suicide prevention; that would reduce suicide rates worldwide. Another target of suicide prevention is suicide prevention in the general population including media reporting. The media can play a major role in reducing stigma and discrimination associated with suicidal behaviours and mental disorders. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, both men and women can be expected to vary in the degree to which they exhibit olfactory performance considered typical of their own or the opposite sex. Sex-atypicality is often described in terms of childhood gender nonconformity, which, however, is not a perfect correlate of non-heterosexual orientation. Here we explored intrasexual variability in psychophysical olfactory performance in a sample of 156 individuals (83 non-heterosexual) and found the lowest odor identification scores in heterosexual men. However, when childhood gender nonconformity was entered in the model along with sexual orientation, better odor identification scores were exhibited by gender-nonconforming men, and greater olfactory sensitivity by gender-conforming women, irrespective of their sexual orientation. Thus, sex-atypicality, but not sexual orientation predicts olfactory performance, and we propose that this might not be limited to olfaction, but represent a more general phenomenon. © 2013 Nováková et al.","Adult; Female; Gender Identity; Heterosexuality; Homosexuality, Female; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Odors; Olfactory Perception; Questionnaires; Sex Characteristics; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior; adult; article; Childhood Gender Nonconformity Scale; Continuous Gender Identity Scale; controlled study; female; heterosexual male; human; human experiment; male; normal human; olfactory discrimination; psychological rating scale; sex atypicality; sex difference; sexual orientation; sexuality; smelling; task performance","","","","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Hierarchical logistic set regression investigated the role of sets of variables reflecting demographic characteristics, gender nonconformity, and gay and ethnic discrimination in relation to depression and gay collective identity. Results showed the discrimination set was related to depression and to gay collective identity, as was gender nonconformity. Follow-up logistic regression showed that both types of discrimination were associated with greater depression, but gender nonconformity was not. Gay discrimination and gender nonconformity were positively associated with gay collective identity, whereas ethnic discrimination was negatively associated. Results are discussed in terms of the use of traditional quantitative data as a potential means of understanding intersectional issues, as well as of contributing to knowledge about individuals facing multiple structural inequalities. © 2013 American Psychological Association.","Adult; Boston; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Hispanic Americans; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; New York; Prejudice; Questionnaires; Self Concept; Social Identification; Socioeconomic Factors; Washington; adult; article; demography; depression; exploratory research; follow up; gender identity; Hispanic; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; knowledge; major clinical study; male; male homosexual; personal experience; quantitative analysis; racism; United States; cross-sectional study; ethnology; female; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; interview; male homosexuality; mental health; middle aged; prejudice; psychology; questionnaire; self concept; social behavior; socioeconomics; statistical model","Depression; Discrimination; Gay; Identity; Intersectionality; Latino","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH060545); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (P30AI087714); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD057785)","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","English","Cult.

Methods and Results: 155 consecutive patients (mean age 70.5±13.0 years, 81 [52%] male gender, BMI 27.2±6.1 kg/m2) with PH undergoing right heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with TDI between January 2008 and December 2009 were retrospectively evaluated including offline speckle tracking analysis of RV contractility. After RHC 23.2% of patients (36) were diagnosed with precapillary PH. Invasive results from RHC were significantly correlated to TTE measurements (E/é, postcapillary wedge pressure [PCWP], r = 0.61, P<0.001; mean, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure [mPAP, sPAP], r = 0.43, P<0.001). Single echocardiographic parameters were of good predictive value for final PH-diagnosis (sPAP, area under the curve [AUC] 0.63, P = 0.025; lateral apical RV longitudinal strain [RVaSl)], AUC 0.76, P = 0.001; E/é, AUC 0.84, P<0.001) which could be increased by combining most predictive parameters after receiver operating curves (ROC) cut off analysis (sPAP>69 mmHg, E/é<12, RVaSl ≥-8.4%). TTE had a sensitivity of 33.33% and a specificity of 100% to identify patients with precapillary PH, and a negative predictive value of 84.72% to rule out precapilary PH. Conclusion: Echocardiography allows feasible and reliable estimation of PH and seems helpful to distinguish between pre-and postcapillary PH. Further prospective studies on patients with different manifestations of PH must validate the predictive value of echocardiography in this clinical setting. © 2012 Hammerstingl et al.","Aged; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Catheterization; Echocardiography; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Contraction; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Wedge Pressure; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; aged; article; diagnostic value; echocardiography; female; heart catheterization; heart ventricle contractility; human; lung artery pressure; lung wedge pressure; major clinical study; male; patient identification; predictive value; pulmonary hypertension; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; speckle tracking analysis; tissue Doppler imaging; transthoracic echocardiography","","","","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Mothers of sons had more concerns about racial discrimination impacting their adolescents' future, whereas mothers of daughters had more gender discrimination concerns. Racial discrimination concerns, but not gender discrimination concerns, were related to lower maternal academic and behavioral expectations. Maternal expectations were related to mothers' responsiveness, rule enforcement, monitoring, and parent-adolescent conflict. The relations between gender and parenting practices were partially explained through mothers' racial discrimination concerns and expectations.

The current study examined whether these diagnostic features are preferentially attended to even when they are irrelevant for the task at hand or when faces appear at different locations in the visual field. To this aim, fearful, happy and neutral faces were presented to healthy individuals in two experiments while measuring eye movements. In Experiment 1, participants had to accomplish an emotion classification, a gender discrimination or a passive viewing task. To differentiate fast, potentially reflexive, eye movements from a more elaborate scanning of faces, stimuli were either presented for 150 or 2000 ms. In Experiment 2, similar faces were presented at different spatial positions to rule out the possibility that eye movements only reflect a general bias for certain visual field locations. In both experiments, participants fixated the eye region much longer than any other region in the face. Furthermore, the eye region was attended to more pronouncedly when fearful or neutral faces were shown whereas more attention was directed toward the mouth of happy facial expressions. Since these results were similar across the other experimental manipulations, they indicate that diagnostic features of emotional expressions are preferentially processed irrespective of task demands and spatial locations. Saliency analyses revealed that a computational model of bottom-up visual attention could not explain these results. Furthermore, as these gaze preferences were evident very early after stimulus onset and occurred even when saccades did not allow for extracting further information from these stimuli, they may reflect a preattentive mechanism that automatically detects relevant facial features in the visual field and facilitates the orientation of attention towards them. This mechanism might crucially depend on amygdala functioning and it is potentially impaired in a number of clinical conditions such as autism or social anxiety disorders. © 2012 Scheller et al.","Adult; Attention; Behavior; Discrimination (Psychology); Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Saccades; Time Factors; Young Adult; adult; article; emotionality; eye fixation; eye movement; facial expression; female; gaze; human; human experiment; male; normal human; task performance; visual field; visual information; visual orientation; visual stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We test theories of democratic foreign policy and feminist international relations that suggest that more deeply democratic countries with greater gender equity will be stronger international human rights promoters. First, the direct empowerment of women as policymakers and civil society constituencies may shift states' incentives and ability to pursue international human rights initiatives. Second, greater sexual equality may lead to feminist socialization of the wider society to promote human rights values. We test these predictions by measuring the relationship between five different measures of sexual equality and a country's propensity to support 30 international human rights outcomes, including legal commitments, humanitarian assistance, and sanctions, controlling for previously established contributing factors such as level of development and democratic regime type. We find that more sexually equal countries are more likely to support international commitments to constrain state violence against individuals, international measures to combat gender and sexual orientation discrimination, and more and higher quality development assistance. However, sexual equality appears to yield less benefit for more costly human rights initiatives: yielding sovereignty to international legal institutions, promoting economic rights through concessionary trade policies, or adopting diplomatic sanctions against pariah states. These effects are stronger in democratic states, where citizen empowerment translates more readily into foreign policy, and are also found in a sample that excludes the Western powers. © The Author(s) 2013.","","deep democracy; gender equity; international human rights; sexual equality","","","","","","","","","","English","J.

We aimed to add to the literature by assessing these relationships among adults seeking psychiatric services in India. Methods: Participants were 60 individuals seeking care at a psychiatric clinic in Bangalore, India. The majority of participants were female with a mean age of 36 years (SD= 9.75). Results: Contrary to our prediction, there were no significant differences between men (M= 28.96; SD= 9.85) and women (M= 33.03; SD= 12.08) on depression severity, t(58). = 1.42, p= .16. Yet, women (M= 10.09, SD= 8.23) reported significantly more perceived stigma than men (M= 5.79, SD= 5.86), t(58). = 2.30, p= .02. Conclusion: While men and women seeking psychiatric services at the psychiatric clinic in India report similar levels of depression severity, women reported more perceived mental illness stigma. Having experienced regular forms of discrimination associated with female status in India, it may be the case that women are more attuned to other forms of stigma, such as mental health stigma investigated in the present study. Given the detrimental impact of stigma on treatment adherence and engagement in care, additional research is needed support this work, including research on interventions to reduce stigma and improve engagement in care. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Adult; Depression; Female; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; India; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Social Stigma; adult; article; cultural factor; depression; disease association; disease severity; female; Hamilton scale; health care utilization; help seeking behavior; human; India; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; mental health care; patient compliance; priority journal; sex difference; sexism; stigma; depression; mental health; mental hospital; middle aged; psychology; severity of illness index; sex difference; social stigma","Depression; Gender; India; Stigma; Women","","","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, (T32AA007455)","Elsevier","","","","","","English","Asian J.

Study 1 develops a measure of Gender RS, defined as anxious expectations of gender-based rejection. Studies 2-5 support the central predictions of the model: Gender RS is associated with increased perceptions of gender-based threats and increased coping by self-silencing-responses that reinforce feelings of alienation and diminished motivation. Study 2 shows that Gender RS is distinct from overall sensitivity to rejection or perceiving the world through the lens of gender. Study 3 shows that Gender RS becomes activated specifically when gender-based rejection is a plausible explanation for negative outcomes. Study 4 provides experimental evidence that Gender RS predicts lower academic self-confidence, greater expectations of bias, and avoidance of opportunities for further help from a weakness-focused expert evaluator. Study 5 tests the Gender RS model in situ, using daily diaries to track women's experiences during the first weeks in a highly competitive law school. Implications for women's coping with the subtle nature of contemporary sexism are discussed as well as the importance of institution-level checks to prevent the costs of gender-based rejection. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Inhibition (Psychology); Male; Models, Psychological; Prejudice; Principal Component Analysis; Regression Analysis; Self Concept; Sex Factors; Social Distance; Social Perception; Stereotyping; Students; United States; Women; adaptive behavior; adult; anxiety; article; factorial analysis; female; human; inhibition (psychology); male; perception; principal component analysis; psychological aspect; psychological model; regression analysis; self concept; sex difference; social distance; social psychology; student; United States","Discrimination; Rejection sensitivity; Self-silencing; Women","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (F31MH072537)","","","","","","","English","J.
