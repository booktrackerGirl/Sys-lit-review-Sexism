Most of the research conducted so far on offensive language detection have addressed this task as a sole optimization objective. However, other linguistic phenomena that are arguably correlated with offensive language and therefore could be beneficial to recognize this type of problematic content on the Web, have not been explored in depth so far. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate whether explicit and implicit concepts involved in the expression of offensive language help in the detection of this phenomenon and how to incorporate these concepts in a computational system. We propose a multi-task learning approach that includes such concepts according to the relevance shown by a feature selection method called mutual information. Our experiments show that some phenomena such as constructiveness, target group and person, figurative language (sarcasm and mockery), insults, improper language, and emotions combined together help to optimize the offensive language detection task, outperforming a state-of-the-art method (the transformer BETO) that we use as our baseline to compare the results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Linguistic phenomena; Multi-task learning; Natural language processing; Offensive language; Spanish","Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Language detection; Language processing; Linguistic phenomena; Multitask learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Offensive languages; Optimisations; Spanish; Textual information; Learning systems","MCIU; FEDER; ERDF","Kogilavani, S., Malliga, S., Jaiabinaya, K., Malini, M., Manisha Kokila, M., Characterization and mechanical properties of offensive language taxonomy and detection techniques (2021) Mater.

Studies have shown that these individuals were more likely to develop mental health issues, likely due to being subjected to more forms of abuse on social media. Hence there is an ardent need to develop automated abusive speech detection systems to tackle the abusive content on social media. There has been an elevation in hate speech or abuse and this paper focuses on the LGBTQIA+ community. Due to the shortage of resources in the said study area, we hypothesize that data augmentation via Pseudolabeling by transliterating the code-mixed text to the parent language will improve the models’ performances on the newly constructed dataset. We put our hypothesis into testing, and studied the performances of several multilingual language models for our cause. © 2022 The Author(s)","Hate speech detection; Homophobia detection; Transphobia detection",,,"Anbukkarasi, S., Varadhaganapathy, S., Neural network-based error handler in natural language processing (2022) Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-10; Ashraf, N., Taha, M., Abd Elfattah, A., Nayel, H., NAYEL @LT-EDI-ACL2022: Homophobia/transphobia detection for equality, diversity, and inclusion using SVM (2022) Proceedings of the second workshop on language technology for equality, diversity and inclusion, pp. 287-290. , Association for Computational Linguistics Dublin, Ireland; Aswani, R., Kar, A.K., Ilavarasan, P.V., Experience: Managing misinformation in social media-insights for policymakers from twitter analytics (2019) J.

One form of social media abuse is misogyny utterance. Misogyny is hatred directed at women. The number of misogyny utterances on social media keeps increasing. Detection of misogyny needs to be done to prevent misogyny utterances. This work examines misogyny on Twitter and proposes a method to detect it. The dataset used comes from tweets on social media Twitter related to women. The experiment in this work was done by comparing the effect of BERT Embedding for Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory. The performance of the methods tested was evaluated based on the resulting accuracy. This work showed that BERT with LSTM surpassed other methods with 86.15% accuracy. The model could outperform other methods because it understands more about the context of the data. © 2022 IEEE.","bert embeddings; long short-term memory; misogyny detection","Brain; Convolutional neural networks; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Bert embedding; Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Freedom of speech; Logistics regressions; Misogyny detection; Performance; Social media; Speech detection; Embeddings",,"Sunarto, T., (2009) kekerasan, dan perempuan, , Jakarta: Penerbit Buku Kompas; Perempuan, K., (2021) Perempuan Dalam Himpitan Pandemi: Lonjakan Kekerasan Seksual, Kekerasan Siber, Perkawinan Anak, dan Keterbatasan Penanganan Ditengah Covid-19, , Catatan Tahunan; (2021) Siapa Tokoh Terpopuler di Twitter pada 2021?, , https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2021/07/09/siapa-tokoh-terpopuler-di-twitter-pada-2021; Caselli, T., Novielli, N., Patti, V., Rosso, P., (2018) EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian: Proceedings of the Final Workshop, , 12-13 December 2018, Naples.

Most of current annotation procedures are aimed at achieving a high level of agreement in order to generate a high quality reference source. However, the annotation guidelines for subjective content may restrict the annotators’ freedom of decision making. Motivated by a moderate annotation agreement in offensive content datasets, we hypothesize that personalized approaches to offensive content identification should be in place. Thus, we propose two novel perspectives of perception: group-based and individual. Using demographics of annotators as well as embeddings of their previous decisions (annotated texts), we are able to train multimodal models (including transformer-based) adjusted to personal or community profiles. Based on the agreement of individuals and groups, we experimentally showed that annotator group agreeability strongly correlates with offensive content recognition quality. The proposed personalized approaches enabled us to create models adaptable to personal user beliefs rather than to agreed offensiveness understanding. Overall, our individualized approaches to offensive content classification outperform classic data-centric methods that generalize offensiveness perception and it refers to all six tested models. Additionally, we developed requirements for annotation procedures, personalization and content processing to make the solutions human-centered. © 2021 The Author(s)","Annotator agreement; Hate speech; Human-centered NLP; Multimodal deep learning; Offensive content; Personalization; Subjective content perception","Deep learning; Information retrieval; Quality control; 'current; Annotator agreement; Data centric; Hate speech; High quality; Human-centered NLP; Multimodal deep learning; Offensive content; Personalizations; Subjective content perception; Decision making","NCN; MNiSW; WUST; ERDF","Agarwal, A., Xie, B., Vovsha, I., Rambow, O., Passonneau, R., (2011), J.

However, cross-dataset model generalization remains a challenge. In this context, we address two still open central questions: (i) to what extent does the generalization depend on the model and the composition and annotation of the training data in terms of different categories?, and (ii) do specific features of the datasets or models influence the generalization potential? To answer (i), we experiment with BERT, ALBERT, fastText, and SVM models trained on nine common public English datasets, whose class (or category) labels are standardized (and thus made comparable), in intra- and cross-dataset setups. The experiments show that indeed the generalization varies from model to model and that some of the categories (e.g., ‘toxic’, ‘abusive’, or ‘offensive’) serve better as cross-dataset training categories than others (e.g., ‘hate speech’). To answer (ii), we use a Random Forest model for assessing the relevance of different model and dataset features during the prediction of the performance of 450 BERT, 450 ALBERT, 450 fastText, and 348 SVM binary abusive language classifiers (1698 in total). We find that in order to generalize well, a model already needs to perform well in an intra-dataset scenario. Furthermore, we find that some other parameters are equally decisive for the success of the generalization, including, e.g., the training and target categories and the percentage of the out-of-domain vocabulary. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Generalization; Hate speech; Offensive language","Automation; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Classification models; Model generalization; Offensive languages; Random forest modeling; SVM model; Training data; Classification (of information)","EC; FCT; ESF; MCTES; FCT","Almerekhi, H., Kwak, H., Jansen, B.J., Salminen, J., Detecting toxicity triggers in online discussions (2019) Proceedings of the 30th ACM conference on hypertext and social media, HT ’19, pp. 291-292. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Arango, A., Pérez, J., Poblete, B., Hate speech detection is not as easy as you may think: A closer look at model validation (2019) Proceedings of the 42nd international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, SIGIR'19, pp. 45-54. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Arango, A., Pérez, J., Poblete, B., Hate speech detection is not as easy as you may think: a closer look at model validation (extended version) (2020) Information Systems; Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web companion, pp. 759-760. , International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee; Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Patti, V., Rangel Pardo, F.M., SemEval-2019 task 5: multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter (2019) Proceedings of the 13th international workshop on semantic evaluation, pp. 54-63. , Association for Computational Linguistics Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., Enriching word vectors with subword information (2017) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146; Chandrasekharan, E., Samory, M., Srinivasan, A., Gilbert, E., The bag of communities: Identifying abusive behavior online with preexisting internet data (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 CHI conference on human factors in computing systems, CHI ’17, pp. 3175-3187. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Davidson, T., Warmsley, D., Macy, M.W., Weber, I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language (2017) Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on web and social media, ICWSM 2017, MontréAl, QuéBec, Canada, May 15-18, 2017, pp. 512-515. , AAAI Press; de Gibert, O., Perez, N., García-Pablos, A., Cuadros, M., Hate speech dataset from a white supremacy forum (2018) Proceedings of the 2nd workshop on abusive language online (ALW2), pp. 11-20. , Association for Computational Linguistics Brussels, Belgium; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 conference of the North American chapter of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies, volume 1 (long and short papers), pp. 4171-4186. , Association for Computational Linguistics Minneapolis, Minnesota; d'Sa, A.G., Illina, I., Fohr, D., BERT and fasttext embeddings for automatic detection of toxic speech (2020) SIIE 2020-information systems and economic intelligence; Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Rosso, P., Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (AMI) (2018) Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for Italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (CLiC-It 2018), Turin, Italy, December 12-13, 2018, CEUR workshop proceedings, 2263. , Caselli T.

For example, the sentiments expressed in a text concerning a topic in the discussion tend to influence a community when a Twitter user retweets the original text, causing a chain of reactions within a network. This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo. Specifically, we collect the tweets mentioned above and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral. In this context, we address the problem as a multiclass classification problem by using the pre-trained language models ULMFiT and AWD-LSTM, which achieved a Fmicro of 0.85. Finally, we use the classified dataset to conduct a case study in which we capture the sentiment orientation during the network evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; NLP; Online Social Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; ULMFiT","E-learning; Long short-term memory; Polarization; Sentiment analysis; Case-studies; Classifieds; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Hashtags; Hate speech; Language model; Multiclass classification problems; Sentiment analysis; ULMFiT; Social networking (online)",,"Bollen, J., Pepe, A., Mao, H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena (2009) CORR; Belkin, L., Kurtzberg, T., Naquin, C., Emotional contagion in the online environment: Investigating the dynamics and implications of emotional encounters in mixed-motive situations in the electronic context (2006) SSRN Electronic Journal, , 07; Hillmann, R., Trier, M., Sentiment polarization and balance among users in online social networks (2012) AMCIS, 24; Seo, K., Pan, R., Panasyuk, A., Detecting communities by sentiment analysis of controversial topics (2016) SBP-BRiMS, 9708, pp. 206-215. , Germany; Collobert, R., Weston, J., Bottou, L., Karlen, M., Kavukcuoglu, K., Kuksa, P., (2011) Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch; Frenda, S., Ghanem, B., Montes, M., Rosso, P., Online hate speech against women: Automatic identification of misogyny and sexism on twitter (2019) Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 36, pp. 4743-4752; Sharma, S., Agrawal, S., Shrivastava, M., Degree based classification of harmful speech using twitter data (2018) TRAC, pp. 106-112. , Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA; Mathew, B., Dutt, R., Goyal, P., Mukherjee, A., (2018) Spread of Hate Speech in Online Social Media; Wulczyn, E., Thain, N., Dixon, L., (2016) Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale; Tsantarliotis, P., Pitoura, E., Tsaparas, P., Troll vulnerability in online social networks (2016) ASONAM, pp. 1394-1396; Fornacciari, P., Mordonini, M., Tomaiuolo, M., (2015) Social Network and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: Towards A Combined Approach, pp. 53-64. , 01; Xu, Z., Yang, Q., Analyzing user retweet behavior on twitter (2012) ASONAM, pp. 46-50. , 08; Jiang, L., Yu, M., Zhou, M., Liu, X., Zhao, T., (2011) Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification, pp. 151-160. , 01; Speriosu, M., Sudan, N., Upadhyay, S., Baldridge, J., (2011) Twitter Polarity Classification with Label Propagation over Lexical Links and the Follower Graph, pp. 53-63. , 07; Founta, A.M., Chatzakou, D., Kourtellis, N., Blackburn, J., Vakali, A., Leontiadis, I., A unified deep learning architecture for abuse detection (2019) WebSci, pp. 105-114. , New York, NY, USA; Cao, R., Lee, R.K.-W., Hoang, T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations (2020) 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, Ser.

We hope that those models will provide unbiased and ethical decisions that will benefit everyone. However, this is not always the case; issues arise during the data preparation process throughout the steps leading to the models' deployment. The continued use of biased datasets and biased processes will adversely damage communities and increase the cost to fix the problem later. In this work, we walk through the decision making process that a researcher should consider before, during, and after a system deployment to understand the broader impacts of their research in the community. Throughout this paper, we discuss fairness, privacy, and ownership issues in the machine learning pipeline, assert the need for a responsible human-over-the-loop methodology to bring accountability into machine learning pipeline, and finally, reflect on the need to explore research agendas that have harmful societal impacts. We examine visual privacy research and draw lessons that can apply broadly to artificial intelligence. Our goal is to provide a systematic analysis of the machine learning pipeline for visual privacy and bias issues. With this pipeline, we hope to raise stakeholder (e.g., researchers, modelers, corporations) awareness as these issues propagate in the various machine learning phases. © 2021 IEEE.","fairness; human-over-the-loop; visual privacy","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Machine learning; Continued use; Data preparation; Decision-making process; Fairness; Human-over-the-loop; Ideal worlds; Machine learning models; Preparation process; System deployment; Visual privacy; Pipelines","NSF","Krishnamurthy, B., Wills, C.E., Characterizing privacy in online social networks (2008) Proceedings of the First Workshop on Online Social Networks.

Such rhetoric, if left unchecked, can propagate virally on these platforms, ultimately escalating to turbulence and violence in the physical, offline spaces. Identifying such content from the volumes of social media feeds is therefore necessary to prevent the damage that it may cause, yet it is infeasible to undertake manually, calling for an automated approach. This paper demonstrates the potential of machine learning to separate social media feeds that are sympathetic to radical extremism using the example of Proud Boys, a contemporary right-wing group. From the tweets collected after Proud Boys protests in August 2020; linguistic, social and auxiliary features are extracted. Significance tests are used to select a subset of these features that contribute towards separating between extremist and normal content. Several machine learning models are trained based on a combination of these features. These models can identify tweets that support Proud Boys with excellent performance metrics.

Such rhetoric, if left unchecked, can propagate virally on these platforms, ultimately escalating to turbulence and violence in the physical, offline spaces. Identifying such content from the volumes of social media feeds is therefore necessary to prevent the damage that it may cause, yet it is infeasible to undertake manually, calling for an automated approach. This paper demonstrates the potential of machine learning to separate social media feeds that are sympathetic to radical extremism using the example of Proud Boys, a contemporary right-wing group. From the tweets collected after Proud Boys protests in August 2020; linguistic, social and auxiliary features are extracted. Significance tests are used to select a subset of these features that contribute towards separating between extremist and normal content. Several machine learning models are trained based on a combination of these features. These models can identify tweets that support Proud Boys with excellent performance metrics. Artificial Neural Networks offer the best accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

Misogynistic speech is a kind of abusive language, which can be simplified as hate speech targeting women, and it is becoming a more and more relevant issue in recent years. AMI IberEval 2018 and AMI EVALITA 2018 were two shared tasks which mainly focused on tackling the problem of misogyny in Twitter, in three different languages, namely English, Italian, and Spanish. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on the phenomena of misogyny in those three languages, by focusing on three main objectives. Firstly, we investigate the most important features to detect misogyny and the issues which contribute to the difficulty of misogyny detection, by proposing a novel system and conducting a broad evaluation on this task. Secondly, we study the relationship between misogyny and other abusive language phenomena, by conducting a series of cross-domain classification experiments. Finally, we explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny in a multilingual environment, by carrying out cross-lingual classification experiments. Our system succeeded to outperform all state of the art systems in all benchmark AMI datasets both subtask A and subtask B. Moreover, intriguing insights emerged from error analysis, in particular about the interaction between different but related abusive phenomena. Based on our cross-domain experiment, we conclude that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while we experimentally found that it is different from sexism. Lastly, our cross-lingual experiments show promising results. Our proposed joint-learning architecture obtained a robust performance across languages, worth to be explored in further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive language online; Automatic misogyny identification; Cross-domain classification; Cross-lingual classification; Social media","Data processing; Information management; Cross-domain; Cross-lingual; Important features; In-depth study; Joint learning; Multilingual environments; Robust performance; State-of-the-art system; Social networking (online)",,"Ahluwalia, R., Soni, H., Callow, E., Nascimento, A.C.A., Cock, M.D., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets (2018) Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-6. , T.

Although primarily meant as forums where readers discuss amongst each other, they can also spark a dialog with the journalists who authored the article. A small but important fraction of comments address the journalists directly, e.g., with questions, recommendations for future topics, thanks and appreciation, or article corrections. However, the sheer number of comments makes it infeasible for journalists to follow discussions around their articles in extenso. A better understanding of this data could support journalists in gaining insights into their audience and fostering engaging and respectful discussions. To this end, we present a dataset of dialogs in which journalists of The Guardian replied to reader comments and identify the reasons why. Based on this data, we formulate the novel task of recommending reader comments to journalists that are worth reading or replying to, i.e., ranking comments in such a way that the top comments are most likely to require the journalists' reaction. As a baseline, we trained a neural network model with the help of a pair-wise comment ranking task. Our experiment reveals the challenges of this task and we outline promising paths for future work. The data and our code are available for research purposes from: https://hpi.de/naumann/projects/repeatability/text-mining.html. © 2020 ACM.","natural language processing; news; online discussions; text mining","Space platforms; Gaining insights; Most likely; Neural network model; Novel task; Online news; Research purpose; Knowledge management","","Khalil Aldous, K., An, J., Jansen, B.J., View, like, comment, post: Analyzing user engagement by topic at 4 levels across 5 social media platforms for 53 news organizations (2019) Proceedings of the International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), 13 (1), pp. 47-57. , AAAI; Ambroselli, C., Risch, J., Krestel, R., Loos, A., Prediction for the newsroom: Which articles will get the most comments?
