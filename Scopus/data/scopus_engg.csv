To explore how current automated hate speech detection approaches perform in detecting this type of hate, we evaluated the performance of two state-of-the-art detection tools, HateSonar and Google’s Perspective API, on a balanced dataset of 300 tweets, half of which are examples of misogynoir and half of which are examples of supporting Black women and an imbalanced dataset of 3138 tweets of which 162 tweets are examples of misogynoir and 2976 tweets are examples of allyship tweets. We aim to determine if these tools flag these messages under any of their classifications of hateful speech (e.g. “hate speech”, “offensive language”, “toxicity” etc.). Close analysis of the classifications and errors shows that current hate speech detection tools are ineffective in detecting misogynoir. They lack sensitivity to context, which is an essential component for misogynoir detection. We found that tweets likely to be classified as hate speech explicitly reference racism or sexism or use profane or aggressive words. Subtle tweets without references to these topics are more challenging to classify. We find that the lack of sensitivity to context may make such tools not only ineffective but potentially harmful to Black women. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media","Social networking (online); 'current; Detection approach; Detection tools; Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media; Speech detection; Speech recognition",,"Bailey, A., On anger, silence, and epistemic injustice (2018) Royal Instit Philos Suppl, 84, pp. 93-115; Bailey, M., Trudy, R., On misogynoir: citation, erasure, and plagiarism (2018) Fem Med Stud, 18 (4), pp. 762-768; Barbour, R.S., Checklists for improving rigour in qualitative research: a case of the tail wagging the dog?

To combat this spread, this paper analyzes social media dialogue surrounding Proud Boys protests from multiple perspectives to understand: (i) the outlook and profiles of users who support and reject Proud Boys; (ii) the network structure to determine influencers and communities; and (iii) the degree of engagement of tweets and the activity of their authors. The analyses indicate that conservative, religious, right-wing segments of the populace support Proud Boys, and their support is rooted in patriotism and defense of American values. Socialists and progressives oppose their radical and hateful ideology. Proud Boys’ topic network is fragmented with low density and is comprised of distinct, small communities. Authors of opposing tweets have a more extensive set of friends and followers, and their tweets receive more likes and retweets. Based on these results, it can be inferred that tweets endorsing Proud Boys’ ideology do not appear to proliferate virally, but instead reach limited audiences through smaller clusters. These analyses and results then form the basis of a classification framework, which can accurately detect tweets supportive of Proud Boys with an accuracy of 0.84 and AUC ROC of 0.89. The capability of the framework to identify and demote supporting tweets offers an extra layer of mitigation that can be employed to stem their spread. The research showcases the promise of mining social media feeds to understand why and how radical extremism spreads and is a gateway for future researchers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Machine learning; Political ideology; Proud Boys; Radical extremism; Social media","Gateways (computer networks); Social networking (online); Case-studies; Machine-learning; Media content; Multiple perspectives; Paper analysis; Political ideologies; Proud boy; Radical extremism; Social media; Social media platforms; Machine learning",,"Abd-Elaal Ahmed, I.A., Badr, A.Z., Hani, M., Detecting violent radical accounts on twitter (2020) Int J Adv Comput Sci Appl, 11 (8), pp. 516-522; Ahmad, S., Asghar, M.Z., Alotaibi, F.M., Awan, I., Detection and classification of social media-based extremist affiliation using sentiment analysis techniques (2019) Human-Centric Comput Inform Sci, (24); Amrutha, B.R., Bindu, K.R., Detecting hate speech in tweets using different deep neural network architectures (2019) 2019 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems, pp. 923-926; (2020) Proud Boys’ Bigotry is on Full Display, , https://www.adl.org/blog/proud-boys-bigotry-is-on-full-display; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) J Stat Mech: Theory Exp; Buitinck, L., Louppe, G., Blondel, M., Pedregosa, F., Mueller, A., Grisel, O., Niculae, V., Varoquaux, G., Api design for machine learning software: Experiences from the scikit-learn project (2013) Proceeding of ECML PKDD Workshop: Languages for Data Mining and Machine Learning, 9, pp. 108-122; Cerbin, L., DeJesus, J., Warnken, J., Gokhale, S., Understanding the anti-mask debate on social media using machine learning techniques (2021) Int J Comput Appl, 28 (3), pp. 150-161; Congyu, W., Gerber, M.S., Forecasting civil unrest using social media and protest participation theory (2018) IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, 5 (1), pp. 82-94; Davis, J., Goadrich, M., The relationship between Precision-Recall and ROC curves (2006) In: International Conference on Machine Learning; DeCook, J.R., Memes and symbolic violence: #proudboys and the use of memes for propaganda and the construction of collective identity (2018) Learn, Media Technol, 43, pp. 485-504; (2018) Introduction to word embedding and word2vec., , https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec; Dreisbach, T., (2021) Conspiracy Charges Bring Proud boys’ History of Violence into Spotlight., , https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/, Accessed: 2020-01-21; Fahim, M., Swapnagokhale, S., Detecting offensive content on twitter during Proud Boys protests (2020) In: International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, pp. 1582-1587; (2021) Far-Right Proud Boys Move Portland Rally to the Former Vanport City, a Site Fraught with Racist History, , https://biturl.top/y6VRNf, Accessed: 2022-01-31; Far-right Proud Boys planned a rally in Clark Park (2021) West Philly Turned out in Force to Rebuke Them, , https://www.inquirer.com/news/proud-boys-philadelphia-clark-park-protest-20200919.html, September 2021.

Studies have shown that these individuals were more likely to develop mental health issues, likely due to being subjected to more forms of abuse on social media. Hence there is an ardent need to develop automated abusive speech detection systems to tackle the abusive content on social media. There has been an elevation in hate speech or abuse and this paper focuses on the LGBTQIA+ community. Due to the shortage of resources in the said study area, we hypothesize that data augmentation via Pseudolabeling by transliterating the code-mixed text to the parent language will improve the models’ performances on the newly constructed dataset. We put our hypothesis into testing, and studied the performances of several multilingual language models for our cause. © 2022 The Author(s)","Hate speech detection; Homophobia detection; Transphobia detection",,,"Anbukkarasi, S., Varadhaganapathy, S., Neural network-based error handler in natural language processing (2022) Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-10; Ashraf, N., Taha, M., Abd Elfattah, A., Nayel, H., NAYEL @LT-EDI-ACL2022: Homophobia/transphobia detection for equality, diversity, and inclusion using SVM (2022) Proceedings of the second workshop on language technology for equality, diversity and inclusion, pp. 287-290. , Association for Computational Linguistics Dublin, Ireland; Aswani, R., Kar, A.K., Ilavarasan, P.V., Experience: Managing misinformation in social media-insights for policymakers from twitter analytics (2019) J.

Schools and institutions remain closed and students’ screen time surged. The classes for the students are moved to the digital platform which leads to an increase in social media usage. Many children had become sufferers of cyber harassment which includes threatening comments on young students, sexual torture through a digital platform, people insulting one another, and the use of fake accounts to harass others. The rising effort on automated cyber harassment detection utilizes many AI-related components Natural language processing techniques and machine learning approaches. Though machine learning models using different algorithms fail to converge with higher accuracy, it is much more important to use significant natural language processes and efficient classifiers to detect cyberbullying comments on social media. In this proposed work, the lexical meaning of the text is analysed by the conventional scheme and the word order of the text is performed by the Fast Text model to improve the computational efficacy of the model. The intention of the text is analysed by various feature extraction methods. The score for intention detection is calculated using the frequency of words with a bully-victim participation score. Finally, the proposed model's performance is measured by different evaluation metrics which illustrate that the accuracy of the model is higher than many other existing classification methods. The error rate is lesser for the detection model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Buzzwords; Cyberbullying; Fast text; Insulting vocabulary; Intention detection; Natural language processing; Word2vec","Coronavirus; Fake detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Buzzword; Cyber bullying; Cyber-harassment; Fast text; Insulting vocabulary; Intention detection; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Word2vec; Students",,"Aguado, G., Julian, V., A multi-agent system for guiding users in on-line social environments (2019) Eng.

Previous studies have confirmed that exposure to this online social intimidation can have very serious offline consequences. With the growth of these multimodal social media platforms, there is an urgent requirement of some device methods for social intimidation detection and prevention. However, most of the prior research has focused on only textual posts for one or two topics of intimidation, namely sexism and racism. The principal objective of this research is to recognize social intimidation from multimodal posts such as text, memes, videos and audio and to target various social media networks such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for several topics of harassment, namely religion based, personal attack, racism, sexism, physical appearance, etc. Previous research has stopped at detection, but this research has taken one step ahead to test the severity based on hate prediction score. The research study is performed using a combination of big data technology, namely Apache Spark, and several deep learning methods which are described below. The system is validated on five public datasets i.e., MLMA Hate Speech Dataset, MMHS150K Dataset, Hateful Memes Dataset, Instagram, Vine Dataset and measured on the basis of precision, recall and f1-score. Performance of the system has been inspected individually for every category of post under three subsections. The results attained specify that the proposed approach gives more feasible solution for social intimidation detection and its severity in online social networking platforms. © 2022 Totem Publisher, Inc.","Apache Spark;

Automatic approaches using machine learning and natural language processing are helpful for detection. For such applications, amongst several different approaches, it is essential to investigate the systems’ robustness to deal with biases towards identity terms (gender, race, religion, for example). In this work, we analyse gender bias in different datasets and proposed a ensemble learning approach based on different feature spaces for hate speech detection with the aim that the model can learn from different abstractions of the problem, namely unintended bias evaluation metrics.

Severe psychological traumas may occur in people who are exposed to this type of communication. It is important to develop automatic classification systems based on language models to examine social media content and distinguish homophobic discourse. This study aims to present a pre-trained Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (M-BERT) model that can successfully detect whether Turkish comments on social media contain homophobic or related hate comments (i.e., sexist, severe humiliation, and defecation expressions). Comments in the Homophobic-Abusive Turkish Comments (HATC) dataset were collected from Instagram to train the detection models. The HATC dataset was manually labeled at the sentence level and combined with the Abusive Turkish Comments (ATC) dataset that has developed in our previous study. The HATC dataset has been balanced using the resampling method and two forms of the dataset (i.e., resHATC and original HATC) were used in the experiments. Afterward, the M-BERT model was compared with DL-based models (i.e., Long-Short Term Memory, Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit), Traditional Machine Learning (TML) classifiers (i.e., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and Ensemble Classifiers (i.e., Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting) for the best model selection. The performance of the detection models was evaluated using F1-score, precision, and recall performance metrics. Results showed the best performance (homophobic F1-score: 82.64%, hateful F1-score: 91.75%, neutral F1-score: 96.08%, average F1-score: 90.15%) were achieved with the M-BERT model on the HATC dataset. The M-BERT detection model can increase the effectiveness of filters in detecting Turkish homophobic and related hate speech in social networks. It can be used to detect homophobic and related hate speech for different languages since the M-BERT model has multilingual pre-trained data. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The DW relies on independent servers (aka instances) that mesh together in a peer-to-peer fashion to deliver a range of services (e.g. micro-blogs, image sharing, video streaming). However, toxic content moderation in this decentralised context is challenging. This is because there is no central entity that can define toxicity, nor a large central pool of data that can be used to build universal classifiers. It is therefore unsurprising that there have been several high-profile cases of the DW being misused to coordinate and disseminate harmful material. Using a dataset of 9.9M posts from 117K users on Pleroma (a popular DW microblogging service), we quantify the presence of toxic content. We find that toxic content is prevalent and spreads rapidly between instances. We show that automating per-instance content moderation is challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data available and the effort required in labelling. We therefore propose and evaluate ModPair, a model sharing system that effectively detects toxic content, gaining an average per-instance macro-F1 score 0.89. © 2022 ACM.","Content moderation; Decentralised web; Pleroma; Toxicity analysis","World Wide Web; Content moderation; Decentralised; Decentralized web; Image sharing; Micro-blog; Model sharing; Peer-to-peer fashion; Pleroma; Toxicity analyse; Video-streaming; Toxicity","EPSRC","(2018) ActivityPub W3C Recommendation, , https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub; (2019) Decentralizedsocial Media Platform Mastodon Deals With An Infux Of Gab Users, , https://www.tsf.foundation/blog/decentralized-social-media-platform-mastodon-deals-with-an-influx-of-gab; (2021) Why Free Speech On-The Internet Isn't Free For All, , https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-19/why-free-speech-on-the-internet-isn-t-free-for-all-quicktake; (2022) Perspective API, , https://www.perspectiveapi.com; Ahn, Y.-Y., Han, S., Kwak, H., Moon, S., Jeong, H., Analysis of topological characteristics of huge online social networking services (2007) Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web., pp. 835-844; Almerekhi, H., Jansen, B.J., Kwak, H., Investigating toxicity across multiple Reddit communities, users, and moderators (2020) Companion proceedings of the web conference, 2020, pp. 294-298; Arhin, K., Baldini, I., Wei, D., Natesan Ramamurthy, K., Singh, M., (2021) Ground-Truth, Whose Truth?-Examining the Challenges with Annotating Toxic Text Datasets, , arXiv preprint, (2021); Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep Learning for Hate Speech Detection in Tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion (Perth, Australia) (WWW '17 Companion), pp. 759-760. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054223, International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE; Berger, A., Della Pietra, S.A., Della Pietra, V.J., A maximum entropy approach to natural language processing (1996) Computational Linguistics, 22 (1), pp. 39-71. , 1996; Bernstein, M., Monroy-Hernández, A., Harry, D., André, P., Panovich, K., Vargas, G., 4chan and/b: An Analysis of Anonymity and Ephemerality in a Large Online Community (2011) Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 5; Bianchi, F., Terragni, S., Hovy, D., (2020) Pre-Training is a Hot Topic: Contextualized Document Embeddings Improve Topic Coherence, , arXiv preprint, (2020); Bielenberg, A., Helm, L., Gentilucci, A., Stefanescu, D., Zhang, H., The growth of diaspora-a decentralized online social network in the wild (2012) 2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM workshops.

It is important, therefore, to provide Information Retrieval systems with mechanisms to identify which results are legitimate and which ones are misleading. Our contribution for satire identification is twofold. On the one hand, we release the Spanish SatiCorpus 2021, a balanced dataset that contains satirical and non-satirical documents. On the other hand, we conduct an extensive evaluation of this dataset with linguistic features and embedding-based features. All feature sets are evaluated separately and combined using different strategies. Our best result is achieved with a combination of the linguistic features and BERT with an accuracy of 97.405%.

Recent regulations are being discussed by U.K. representatives (“Online Safety Bill”) and by the European Commission, which plans on introducing Hate Speech as an “EU crime”. The recent legislation having passed in order to combat this kind of speech places the burden of identification on the hosting websites and often within a tight time frame (24 h in France and Germany). These constraints make automatic Hate Speech detection a very important topic for major social media platforms. However, recent literature on Hate Speech detection lacks a benchmarking system that can evaluate how different approaches compare against each other regarding the prediction made concerning different types of text (short snippets such as those present on Twitter, as well as lengthier fragments). This paper intended to deal with this issue and to take a step forward towards the standardization of testing for this type of natural language processing (NLP) application. Furthermore, this paper explored different transformer and LSTM-based models in order to evaluate the performance of multi-task and transfer learning models used for Hate Speech detection. Some of the results obtained in this paper surpassed the existing ones. The paper concluded that transformer-based models have the best performance on all studied Datasets. © 2022 by the authors.

One form of social media abuse is misogyny utterance. Misogyny is hatred directed at women. The number of misogyny utterances on social media keeps increasing. Detection of misogyny needs to be done to prevent misogyny utterances. This work examines misogyny on Twitter and proposes a method to detect it. The dataset used comes from tweets on social media Twitter related to women. The experiment in this work was done by comparing the effect of BERT Embedding for Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory. The performance of the methods tested was evaluated based on the resulting accuracy. This work showed that BERT with LSTM surpassed other methods with 86.15% accuracy.

The current research in Indonesian Twitter focuses on developing better hate speech detection models. However, there is limited study on the explainability aspects of hate speech detection. The research aims to explain issues that previous researchers have not detailed and attempt to answer the shortcomings of previous researchers. There are 13,169 tweets in the dataset with labels like ""hate speech"" and ""abusive language"". The dataset also provides binary labels on whether hate speech is directed to individual, group, religion, race, physical disability, and gender. In the research, classification is performed by using traditional machine learning models, and the predictions are evaluated using an Explainable AI model, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to allow users to comprehend why a tweet is regarded as a hateful message. Moreover, models that perform well in classification perceive incorrect words as contributing to hate speech. As a result, such models are unsuitable for deployment in the real world. In the investigation, the combination of XGBoost and logical LIME explanations produces the most logical results. The use of the Explainable AI model highlights the importance of choosing the ideal model while maintaining users trust in the deployed model. © 2022 CommIT Journal.

The consequences of hate-speech are devastating, causing severe depression and even leading people to commit suicide. Hate-speech identification is challenging as the large amount of daily publications makes it impossible to review every comment by hand. Moreover, hate-speech is also spread by hoaxes that requires language and context understanding. With the aim of reducing the number of comments that should be reviewed by experts, or even for the development of autonomous systems, the automatic identification of hate-speech has gained academic relevance. However, the reliability of automatic approaches is still limited specifically in languages other than English, in which some of the state-of-the-art techniques have not been analyzed in detail. In this work, we examine which features are most effective in identifying hate-speech in Spanish and how these features can be combined to develop more accurate systems. In addition, we characterize the language present in each type of hate-speech by means of explainable linguistic features and compare our results with state-of-the-art approaches. Our research indicates that combining linguistic features and transformers by means of knowledge integration outperforms current solutions regarding hate-speech identification in Spanish. © 2022, The Author(s).","Feature engineering; Hate-speech; Knowledge integration; Natural language processing; Text classification",,"ERDF","Albadi, N., Kurdi, M., Mishra, S., Are they our brothers?

However, detecting hatred and abuse in low-resource languages is a non-trivial challenge. The lack of sufficient labeled data in low-resource languages and inconsistent generalization ability of transformer-based multilingual pre-trained language models for typologically diverse languages make these models inefficient in some cases. We propose a meta learning-based approach to study the problem of few-shot hate speech and offensive language detection in low-resource languages that will allow hateful or offensive content to be predicted by only observing a few labeled data items in a specific target language. We investigate the feasibility of applying a meta learning approach in cross-lingual few-shot hate speech detection by leveraging two meta learning models based on optimization-based and metric-based (MAML and Proto-MAML) methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort of this kind. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider hate speech and offensive language detection as two separate tasks and make two diverse collections of different publicly available datasets comprising 15 datasets across 8 languages for hate speech and 6 datasets across 6 languages for offensive language. Our experiments show that meta learning-based models outperform transfer learning-based models in a majority of cases, and that Proto-MAML is the best performing model, as it can quickly generalize and adapt to new languages with only a few labeled data points (generally, 16 samples per class yields an effective performance) to identify hateful or offensive content. © 2013 IEEE.","cross-lingual classification; few-shot learning; Hate speech; meta learning; offensive language; transfer learning; XLM-RoBERTa","Speech recognition; Cross-lingual; Cross-lingual classification; Few-shot learning; Hate speech; Language detection; Low resource languages; Metalearning; Offensive languages; Transfer learning; XLM-RoBERTa; Speech",,"Waseem, Z., Hovy, D., Hateful symbols or hateful people?

Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) enables a better understanding of context by learning the future time steps in a bidirectional manner. Moreover, GRU deploys reset and update gates in the hidden layer, which is computationally more efficient than a conventional LSTM. This paper proposes an efficient network model based on deep BLSTM-GRU for ciphertext classification aiming to mark the category to which the ciphertext belongs. The proposed model performance was evaluated using well-known evaluation metrics on two publicly available datasets encrypted with various classical cipher methods and performance was compared against one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and various other deep learning-based approaches. The experimental results showed that the BLSTM-GRU cell unit network model achieved a high classification accuracy of up to 95.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an RNN-based model has been applied for the ciphertext classification. © 2013 IEEE.","1D-convolutional neural networks; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Ciphertext classification; Gated recurrent unit; Recurrent neural networks","Brain; Convolution; Cryptography; Job analysis; 1d-convolutional neural network; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Cipher; Ciphertext classification; Ciphertexts; Convolutional neural network; Features extraction; Gated recurrent unit; Task analysis; Long short-term memory",,"Swapna, S., Dileep, A.D., Sekhar, C.C., Kant, S., Block cipher identi-cation using support vector classi-cation and regression (2010) J.

Millions of users engage themselves with the posts circulated on these platforms. Despite the social regulations and protocols imposed by these platforms, it is difficult to restrict some objectionable posts carrying hateful content. Automatic hate speech detection on social media platforms is an essential task that has not been solved efficiently despite multiple attempts by various researchers. It is a challenging task that involves identifying hateful content from social media posts. These posts may reveal hate outrageously, or they may be subjective to the user or a community. Relying on manual inspection delays the process, and the hateful content may remain available online for a long time. The current state-of-the-art methods for tackling hate speech perform well when tested on the same dataset but fail miserably on cross-datasets. Therefore, we propose an ensemble learning-based adaptive model for automatic hate speech detection, improving the cross-dataset generalization. The proposed expert model for hate speech detection works towards overcoming the strong user-bias present in the available annotated datasets. We conduct our experiments under various experimental setups and demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy on the latest issues such as COVID-19 and US presidential elections. In particular, the loss in performance observed under cross-dataset evaluation is the least among all the models. Also, while restricting the maximum number of tweets per user, we incur no drop in performance. © 2021","Ensemble learning; Hate speech detection; Social media","Learning systems; Speech; Speech recognition; Case-studies; Ensemble learning; Hate speech detection; Learning models; Performance; Social media; Social media platforms; Social protocols; Social regulations; Speech detection; Social networking (online)",,"Agarwal, S., Chowdary, C.R., A-stacking and a-bagging: Adaptive versions of ensemble learning algorithms for spoof fingerprint detection (2020) Expert Systems with Applications, 146. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419308784, URL; Agarwal, S., Rattani, A., Chowdary, C.R., A comparative study on handcrafted features v/s deep features for open-set fingerprint liveness detection (2021) Pattern Recognition Letters, 147, pp. 34-40. , https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865521001276, URL; Agrawal, S., Awekar, A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms (2018) Advances in information retrieval - 40th European conference on IR research, ECIR 2018, Grenoble, France, March 26-29, 2018, Proceedings, pp. 141-153. , Pasi G.

Given the increasing number of experiences of sexism shared online, categorizing these recollections automatically can support the battle against sexism, since it can promote successful evaluations by gender studies researchers and government representatives engaged in policy making. In this paper, we examine the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism. We devise self-training-based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. In addition to data augmentation methods, we develop a neural model which combines biLSTM and attention with a domain-adapted BERT model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Further, we formulate a multi-level training approach in which models are sequentially trained using categories of sexism of different levels of granularity. Moreover, we devise a loss function that exploits any label confidence scores associated with the data. Several proposed methods outperform various baselines on a recently released dataset for multi-label sexism categorization across several standard metrics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Fine-grained categorization; Multi-label classification; Multi-level; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification","Supervised learning; Fine grained; Fine-grained categorization; Gender studies; Multi-label classifications; Multi-labels; Multilevels; Policy making; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification; Classification (of information)",,"Abburi, H., Parikh, P., Chhaya, N., Varma, V., Semi-supervised multi-task learning for multi-label fine-grained sexism classification (2020) Proceedings of the 28Th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, International Committee on Computational Linguistics, pp. 5810-5820. , Barcelona, Spain (Online); Abney, S., (2007) Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics, , Chapman and Hall/CRC; Agrawal, S., Awekar, A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms (2018) European Conference on Information Retrieval, pp. 141-153. , Springer; Anzovino, M., Fersini, E., Rosso, P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter (2018) International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64. , Springer; Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760. , In:, International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, pp; Burnap, P., Williams, M.L., Us and them: identifying cyber hate on twitter across multiple protected characteristics (2016) EPJ Data Sci, 5 (1), p. 11; Cer, D., Yang, Y., Syhua, N., Limtiaco, N., John, R.S., Constant, N., Guajardo-Cespedes, M., Tar, C., (2018) Universal sentence encoder, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Chiril, P., Moriceau, V., Benamara, F., Mari, A., Origgi, G., Coulomb-Gully, M., An annotated corpus for sexism detection in french tweets (2020) Proceedings of the 12Th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 1397-1403; Chiril, P., Moriceau, V., Benamara, F., Mari, A., Origgi, G., Coulomb-Gully, M., He said “who’s gonna take care of your children when you are at acl?’: Reported sexist acts are not sexist (2020) Proceedings of the 58Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 4055-4066; Chowdhury, A.G., Sawhney, R., Shah, R., Mahata, D., # youtoo?

The feeling of hatred, fear, or resentment is present before people from different communities from ours. With the rise of social networks like Twitter, hate speeches were swift because of the pseudo feeling of anonymity that these platforms provide. Sometimes this violent behavior on social networks that begins as threats or insults to third parties breaks the Internet barriers to become an act of real physical violence. Hence, this proposal aims to correctly classify xenophobic posts on social networks, specifically on Twitter. In addition, we collected a xenophobic tweets database from which we also extracted new features by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach. Then, we provide an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model, allowing us to understand better why a post is considered xenophobic. Consequently, we provide a set of contrast patterns describing xenophobic tweets, which could help decision-makers prevent acts of violence caused by xenophobic posts on Twitter. Finally, our interpretable results based on our new feature representation approach jointly with a contrast pattern-based classifier obtain similar classification results than other feature representations jointly with prominent machine learning classifiers, which are not easy to understand by an expert in the application area. © 2021 by the authors.

Most of current annotation procedures are aimed at achieving a high level of agreement in order to generate a high quality reference source. However, the annotation guidelines for subjective content may restrict the annotators’ freedom of decision making. Motivated by a moderate annotation agreement in offensive content datasets, we hypothesize that personalized approaches to offensive content identification should be in place. Thus, we propose two novel perspectives of perception: group-based and individual. Using demographics of annotators as well as embeddings of their previous decisions (annotated texts), we are able to train multimodal models (including transformer-based) adjusted to personal or community profiles. Based on the agreement of individuals and groups, we experimentally showed that annotator group agreeability strongly correlates with offensive content recognition quality. The proposed personalized approaches enabled us to create models adaptable to personal user beliefs rather than to agreed offensiveness understanding. Overall, our individualized approaches to offensive content classification outperform classic data-centric methods that generalize offensiveness perception and it refers to all six tested models. Additionally, we developed requirements for annotation procedures, personalization and content processing to make the solutions human-centered. © 2021 The Author(s)","Annotator agreement; Hate speech; Human-centered NLP; Multimodal deep learning; Offensive content; Personalization; Subjective content perception","Deep learning; Information retrieval; Quality control; 'current; Annotator agreement; Data centric; Hate speech; High quality; Human-centered NLP; Multimodal deep learning; Offensive content; Personalizations; Subjective content perception; Decision making","NCN; MNiSW; WUST; ERDF","Agarwal, A., Xie, B., Vovsha, I., Rambow, O., Passonneau, R., (2011), J.

Abusive comments on images can be humiliating and harmful to those who share photos. Developing a comment filter in languages other than English is difficult and time-consuming. This paper proposes a dataset called Abusive Turkish Comments (ATC) to detect abusive Instagram comments in Turkish. It is composed of a large number of Instagram comments posted to tabloid and sports accounts (i.e., 10,528 abusive and 19,826 not-abusive). It is the first public dataset dedicated to detecting abusive Turkish messages, as far as we know. The sentiment annotation has been done in sentence-level by assigning polarity to each comment. The performance of the abusive message detection models was evaluated using several performance metrics: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), five well-known classifiers (i.e., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression), and two reweighted classifiers (i.e., Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) were compared in terms of F1-score, precision, and recall. The results showed that the best performance (i.e., Micro-averaged F1-score: 0.974, Macro-averaged F1-score: 0.973, Kappa-value: 0.946) was yielded by the CNN model on the oversampled ATC dataset. The abusive message detection model proposed in this study can contribute to the development of Turkish comment filters on Instagram. Different model combinations are considered to select the best model that gives better recognition accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive comment; Classification; Dataset; Hate speech; Instagram; Social media","Adaptive boosting; Classifiers; Convolution; Decision trees; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Abusive comment; Convolutional neural network; Dataset; F1 scores; Hate speech; Instagram; Message detection; Performance; Social media; Turkishs; Classification (of information)",,"Abooraig, R., Al-Zu'bi, S., Kanan, T., Hawashin, B., Al Ayoub, M., Hmeidi, I., Automatic categorization of Arabic articles based on their political orientation (2018) Digital Investigation, 25, pp. 24-41; (2017), https://doi.org/10.1109/INTECH.2017.8102422, Abroyan, N.

However, cross-dataset model generalization remains a challenge. In this context, we address two still open central questions: (i) to what extent does the generalization depend on the model and the composition and annotation of the training data in terms of different categories?, and (ii) do specific features of the datasets or models influence the generalization potential? To answer (i), we experiment with BERT, ALBERT, fastText, and SVM models trained on nine common public English datasets, whose class (or category) labels are standardized (and thus made comparable), in intra- and cross-dataset setups. The experiments show that indeed the generalization varies from model to model and that some of the categories (e.g., ‘toxic’, ‘abusive’, or ‘offensive’) serve better as cross-dataset training categories than others (e.g., ‘hate speech’). To answer (ii), we use a Random Forest model for assessing the relevance of different model and dataset features during the prediction of the performance of 450 BERT, 450 ALBERT, 450 fastText, and 348 SVM binary abusive language classifiers (1698 in total). We find that in order to generalize well, a model already needs to perform well in an intra-dataset scenario. Furthermore, we find that some other parameters are equally decisive for the success of the generalization, including, e.g., the training and target categories and the percentage of the out-of-domain vocabulary. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Generalization; Hate speech; Offensive language","Automation; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Classification models; Model generalization; Offensive languages; Random forest modeling; SVM model; Training data; Classification (of information)","EC; FCT; ESF; MCTES; FCT","Almerekhi, H., Kwak, H., Jansen, B.J., Salminen, J., Detecting toxicity triggers in online discussions (2019) Proceedings of the 30th ACM conference on hypertext and social media, HT ’19, pp. 291-292. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Arango, A., Pérez, J., Poblete, B., Hate speech detection is not as easy as you may think: A closer look at model validation (2019) Proceedings of the 42nd international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, SIGIR'19, pp. 45-54. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Arango, A., Pérez, J., Poblete, B., Hate speech detection is not as easy as you may think: a closer look at model validation (extended version) (2020) Information Systems; Badjatiya, P., Gupta, S., Gupta, M., Varma, V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets (2017) Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web companion, pp. 759-760. , International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee; Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Patti, V., Rangel Pardo, F.M., SemEval-2019 task 5: multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter (2019) Proceedings of the 13th international workshop on semantic evaluation, pp. 54-63. , Association for Computational Linguistics Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., Enriching word vectors with subword information (2017) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146; Chandrasekharan, E., Samory, M., Srinivasan, A., Gilbert, E., The bag of communities: Identifying abusive behavior online with preexisting internet data (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 CHI conference on human factors in computing systems, CHI ’17, pp. 3175-3187. , Association for Computing Machinery New York, NY, USA; Davidson, T., Warmsley, D., Macy, M.W., Weber, I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language (2017) Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on web and social media, ICWSM 2017, MontréAl, QuéBec, Canada, May 15-18, 2017, pp. 512-515. , AAAI Press; de Gibert, O., Perez, N., García-Pablos, A., Cuadros, M., Hate speech dataset from a white supremacy forum (2018) Proceedings of the 2nd workshop on abusive language online (ALW2), pp. 11-20. , Association for Computational Linguistics Brussels, Belgium; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 conference of the North American chapter of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies, volume 1 (long and short papers), pp. 4171-4186. , Association for Computational Linguistics Minneapolis, Minnesota; d'Sa, A.G., Illina, I., Fohr, D., BERT and fasttext embeddings for automatic detection of toxic speech (2020) SIIE 2020-information systems and economic intelligence; Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Rosso, P., Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (AMI) (2018) Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for Italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (CLiC-It 2018), Turin, Italy, December 12-13, 2018, CEUR workshop proceedings, 2263. , Caselli T.

Social media, blogs and community forums are examples where people are freely allowed to communicate. However, freedom of expression is not always respectful since offensive or insulting language is sometimes used. Social media companies often rely on users and content moderators to report on this type of content. Nevertheless, due to the large amount of content generated every day on the Web, automatic systems based on Natural Language Processing techniques are required for identifying abusive language online. To date, most of the systems developed to combat this problem are mainly focused on English content, but this issue is a worldwide concern and therefore other languages such as Spanish are involved. In this paper, we address the task of Spanish hate speech identification on social media and provide a deeper understanding of the capabilities of new techniques based on machine learning. In particular, we compare the performance of Deep Learning methods with recently pre-trained language models based on Transfer Learning as well as with traditional machine learning models. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in Spanish by applying multilingual and monolingual pre-trained language models such as BERT, XLM and BETO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BERT; BETO; Hate speech; Natural language processing; Text classification; Transfer learning","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Transfer learning; Automatic systems; Language model; Large amounts; Learning methods; Machine learning models; NAtural language processing; Speech detection; Speech identification; Learning systems","MCIU; FEDER","Aragón, M.E., Álvarez-Carmona, M., (2019), Á., Montes-y Gómez, M., Escalante, H.

For example, the sentiments expressed in a text concerning a topic in the discussion tend to influence a community when a Twitter user retweets the original text, causing a chain of reactions within a network. This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo. Specifically, we collect the tweets mentioned above and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral. In this context, we address the problem as a multiclass classification problem by using the pre-trained language models ULMFiT and AWD-LSTM, which achieved a Fmicro of 0.85. Finally, we use the classified dataset to conduct a case study in which we capture the sentiment orientation during the network evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; NLP; Online Social Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; ULMFiT","E-learning; Long short-term memory; Polarization; Sentiment analysis; Case-studies; Classifieds; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Hashtags; Hate speech; Language model; Multiclass classification problems; Sentiment analysis; ULMFiT; Social networking (online)",,"Bollen, J., Pepe, A., Mao, H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena (2009) CORR; Belkin, L., Kurtzberg, T., Naquin, C., Emotional contagion in the online environment: Investigating the dynamics and implications of emotional encounters in mixed-motive situations in the electronic context (2006) SSRN Electronic Journal, , 07; Hillmann, R., Trier, M., Sentiment polarization and balance among users in online social networks (2012) AMCIS, 24; Seo, K., Pan, R., Panasyuk, A., Detecting communities by sentiment analysis of controversial topics (2016) SBP-BRiMS, 9708, pp. 206-215. , Germany; Collobert, R., Weston, J., Bottou, L., Karlen, M., Kavukcuoglu, K., Kuksa, P., (2011) Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch; Frenda, S., Ghanem, B., Montes, M., Rosso, P., Online hate speech against women: Automatic identification of misogyny and sexism on twitter (2019) Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 36, pp. 4743-4752; Sharma, S., Agrawal, S., Shrivastava, M., Degree based classification of harmful speech using twitter data (2018) TRAC, pp. 106-112. , Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA; Mathew, B., Dutt, R., Goyal, P., Mukherjee, A., (2018) Spread of Hate Speech in Online Social Media; Wulczyn, E., Thain, N., Dixon, L., (2016) Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale; Tsantarliotis, P., Pitoura, E., Tsaparas, P., Troll vulnerability in online social networks (2016) ASONAM, pp. 1394-1396; Fornacciari, P., Mordonini, M., Tomaiuolo, M., (2015) Social Network and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: Towards A Combined Approach, pp. 53-64. , 01; Xu, Z., Yang, Q., Analyzing user retweet behavior on twitter (2012) ASONAM, pp. 46-50. , 08; Jiang, L., Yu, M., Zhou, M., Liu, X., Zhao, T., (2011) Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification, pp. 151-160. , 01; Speriosu, M., Sudan, N., Upadhyay, S., Baldridge, J., (2011) Twitter Polarity Classification with Label Propagation over Lexical Links and the Follower Graph, pp. 53-63. , 07; Founta, A.M., Chatzakou, D., Kourtellis, N., Blackburn, J., Vakali, A., Leontiadis, I., A unified deep learning architecture for abuse detection (2019) WebSci, pp. 105-114. , New York, NY, USA; Cao, R., Lee, R.K.-W., Hoang, T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations (2020) 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, Ser.

However, the existing theoretical definitions of hate speech are not sufficiently fleshed out or easily operable. To overcome this inadequacy, and with the help of interdisciplinary experts, we propose an empirical definition of hate speech by providing a list of 10 hate speech indicators and the rationale behind them (the indicators refer to specific, observable, and measurable characteristics that offer a practical definition of hate speech). A preliminary exploratory examination of the structure of hate speech, with the focus on comments related to migrants (one of the most reported grounds of hate speech), revealed that two indicators in particular, denial of human rights and promoting violent behavior, occupy a central role in the network of indicators. Furthermore, we discuss the practical implications of the proposed hate speech indicators—especially (semi-)automatic detection using the latest natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods. Having a set of quantifiable indicators could benefit researchers, human right activists, educators, analysts, and regulators by providing them with a pragmatic approach to hate speech assessment and detection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Comments; Hate speech; Hate speech indicators; Hate speech structure; Migrants",,"SAS; APVV; VEGA; ","(2016) Eurobarometer, S. 452, media pluralism and democracy, , https://ec.europa.eu, Retrieved from; (2020) Being Young in Europe today—digital World, , https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat, Retrieved from; (2013) No Hate Speech Movement, , https://www.coe.int/en/web/no-hate-campaign, Retrieved from; (2016) General Policy Recommendation No. 15 on Combating Hate Speech, , https://coe.int, Retrieved from; Mathew, B., Saha, P., Tharad, H., Rajgaria, S., Singhania, P., Maity, S.K., Mukherjee, A., Thou shalt not hate: Countering online hate speech (2019) Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 13, pp. 369-380; Salminen, J., Hopf, M., Chowdhury, S.A., Developing an online hate classifier for multiple social media platforms (2020) Hum Cent Comput Inf Sci, 10, p. 1; Sambaraju, R., McVittie, C., Examining abuse in online media (2020) Soc Pers Psychol Compass, 14 (3); MacAvaney, S., Yao, H.R., Yang, E., Russell, K., Goharian, N., Frieder, O., Hate speech detection: challenges and solutions (2019) PLoS ONE, 14 (8); Brown, A., What is hate speech?

Often used to convey humor through sarcasm or to emphasize a point, offensive speech may also be employed to insult, deride and mock alternate points of view. In turbulent and chaotic circumstances, insults and mockery can lead to violence and unrest, and hence, such speech must be identified and tagged to limit its damage. This paper presents an application of machine learning to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds shared after the protests by Proud Boys, an extremist, ideological and violent hate group. A comprehensive coding guide, consolidating definitions of what constitutes offensive content based on the potential to trigger and incite people is developed and used to label the tweets. Linguistic, auxiliary and social features extracted from these labeled tweets were used to train machine learning classifiers, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of about 92%. An analysis of the importance scores reveals that offensiveness is pre-dominantly a function of words and their combinations, rather than meta features such as punctuations and quotes. This observation can form the foundation of pre-trained classifiers that can be deployed to automatically detect offensive speech in new and unforeseen circumstances. © 2021 IEEE.","Classification; Machine Learning; Offensive Speech; Proud Boys; Social Media","Classification (of information); Machine learning; Speech; Chaotics; Content-based; Machine-learning; Metafeature; Offensive speech; Online social medias; Proud boy; Social media; Social media platforms; Social networking (online)",,"(2019) The EU Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech Online, , https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-andfundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/, June; Abderroauf, C., Oussalah, M., On Online Hate Speech Detection: Effects of Negated Data Construction (2019) Proc. of Intl.

Today, machine learning techniques play an important role in detecting inappropriate content and help moderate online interaction. Text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods has been extensively studied using deep learning models and transformers which have shown impressive results. Despite this, specific classification tasks on limited datasets still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose an approach based on an Attention-Based Bidirectional LSTM model and a combination of custom features to enhance automatic misogyny identification (AMI) on social media. We present a multi-lingual study of the phenomena by carrying out different classification experiments. Our study focuses on selecting most important features to improve the model for misogyny detection.

It is estimated that one in every three women worldwide has experienced physical, emotional, or sexual violence. Similarly, each year one out of two children are victims of some form of violence including domestic aggression and bullying. Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media, women and children are now vulnerable to other types of violence such as cyber-bullying and online sexual or emotional harassment. To help alleviate this social problem, the use of computer science and related technologies has been leveraged in recent years. The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and mobile computing, pattern recognition, cloud computing and similar technologies, have been used to formulate solutions to detect and prevent violent acts against women and children. In this paper, a systematic review of some of the efforts that can help address the problem of violence against women and children is presented. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of these contributions and identifies trends, architectures, technologies, and current open challenges. The survey was developed using a literature review of academic documents published from 2010 to 2020. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: online detection, offline detection, safety, and education. These contributions were further categorized based on the computer science approaches and technologies used: artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and digital serious games. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Internet of Things; machine learning; ubiquitous computing","Internet of things; Pattern recognition; Serious games; Ubiquitous computing; Cyber bullying; Literature reviews; On-line detection; Public health issues; Social media; Social problems; State of the art; Systematic Review; Artificial intelligence","TNM; CONACYT","Alliance, V.P., (2021) Definition and Typology of Violence, , https://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/definition/en/, [Online]; (2020) Global Status Report on Preventing Violence against Children, , https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-ofhealth/violence-prevention/global-status-report-on-violence-againstchildren-2020, Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization.

Detecting such content is crucial to filtering or blocking inappropriate content on the Web. However, due to the huge amount of data posted every day, automatic methods are essential for identifying this type of content. Seeking to address this issue, the Natural Language Processing community is increasingly involved in testing a wide range of techniques for hate speech detection. While achieving promising results, these techniques consider hate speech detection as the sole optimization objective, without involving other related tasks such as polarity and emotion classification that are strongly linked to offensive behavior. In this paper, we propose the first Multi-task approach that leverages the shared affective knowledge to detect hate speech in Spanish tweets, using a well-known Transformer-based model. Our results show that the combination of both polarity and emotional knowledge helps to detect hate speech more accurately across datasets. © 2013 IEEE.","multi-task learning; Natural language processing; offensive language; sentiment analysis; Spanish hate speech","Multi-task learning; Sentiment analysis; Speech; Automatic method; Community IS; Emotion classification; NAtural language processing; Social media platforms; Speech detection; Speech recognition","ERDF","Pang, B., Foundations and trends in information retrieval (2008) Found.

Online social network (OSN) platforms intensify this problem by allowing their users to easily distort and fabri-cate the information and disseminate it farther and rapidly. In this paper, we study the impact of misinformation associated with a religious inflection on the psychology and behavior of the OSN users. The article presents a detailed study to understand the reaction of social media users when exposed to unverified content related to the Islamic community during the COVID-19 lockdown period in India. The analysis was carried out on Twitter users where the data were collected using three scraping packages, Tweepy, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup, to cover more users affected by this misinformation. A labeled dataset is prepared where each tweet is assigned one of the four reaction polarities, namely, E (endorse), D (deny), Q (question), and N (neutral). Analysis of collected data was carried out in five phases where we investigate the engagement of E, D, Q, and N users, tone of the tweets, and the consequence upon repeated exposure of such information. The evidence demonstrates that the circulation of such content during the pandemic and lockdown phase had made people more vulnerable in perceiving the unreliable tweets as fact. It was also observed that people absorbed the negativity of the online content, which induced a feeling of hatred, anger, distress, and fear among them. People with similar mindset form online groups and express their negative attitude to other groups based on their opinions, indicating the strong signals of social unrest and public tensions in society. The paper also presents a deep learning-based stance detection model as one of the automated mechanisms for tracking the news on Twitter as being potentially false. Stance classifier aims to predict the attitude of a tweet towards a news headline and thereby assists in determining the veracity of news by monitoring the distribution of different reactions of the users towards it. The proposed model, employing deep learning (convolutional neural network (CNN)) and sentence embedding (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)) techniques, outperforms the existing systems. The performance is evaluated on the benchmark SemEval stance dataset. Furthermore, a newly annotated dataset is prepared and released with this study to help the research of this domain. © 2020 by the authors.

Until a few years ago, it took place both in public and private spaces, but it has now broken into Digital Space, adopting more symbolic expressions. There has been some important related work from Data Science approaches. Mainly about cyberbullying, detection of language patterns through supervised algorithms, a few works on unsupervised learning, and some on violence against women. This article is part of a larger investigation related to the Violence Against Women in Digital Space phenomena in Mexico from Spanish-language interactions in microblogging social network, Twitter. We present the framework to address these phenomena from a Data Science perspective and go through some first stage results. The goal is to give Data Science perspectives and insights related to the understanding of Digital Violence Against Women, with the purpose of generating awareness about this problem by, modifying manners and implementing public policies that could counteract this social problem. © 2020 IEEE.","Data Science; Digital Violence Against Women; Social Media Analysis","Intelligent computing; Pattern recognition; Cyber bullying; Language patterns; Private spaces; Research papers; Social problems; Spanish language; Supervised algorithm; Symbolic expression; Data Science","ITESM","Aggarwal, C.C., (2015) Data Mining: The Textbook, , Springer, 1st edition; Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Nozza, D., Patti, V., Manuel Rangel Pardo, F., Rosso, P., Sanguinetti, M., SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63. , Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, June 2019.

Misogynistic speech is a kind of abusive language, which can be simplified as hate speech targeting women, and it is becoming a more and more relevant issue in recent years. AMI IberEval 2018 and AMI EVALITA 2018 were two shared tasks which mainly focused on tackling the problem of misogyny in Twitter, in three different languages, namely English, Italian, and Spanish. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on the phenomena of misogyny in those three languages, by focusing on three main objectives. Firstly, we investigate the most important features to detect misogyny and the issues which contribute to the difficulty of misogyny detection, by proposing a novel system and conducting a broad evaluation on this task. Secondly, we study the relationship between misogyny and other abusive language phenomena, by conducting a series of cross-domain classification experiments. Finally, we explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny in a multilingual environment, by carrying out cross-lingual classification experiments. Our system succeeded to outperform all state of the art systems in all benchmark AMI datasets both subtask A and subtask B. Moreover, intriguing insights emerged from error analysis, in particular about the interaction between different but related abusive phenomena. Based on our cross-domain experiment, we conclude that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while we experimentally found that it is different from sexism. Lastly, our cross-lingual experiments show promising results. Our proposed joint-learning architecture obtained a robust performance across languages, worth to be explored in further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive language online; Automatic misogyny identification; Cross-domain classification; Cross-lingual classification; Social media","Data processing; Information management; Cross-domain; Cross-lingual; Important features; In-depth study; Joint learning; Multilingual environments; Robust performance; State-of-the-art system; Social networking (online)",,"Ahluwalia, R., Soni, H., Callow, E., Nascimento, A.C.A., Cock, M.D., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets (2018) Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-6. , T.

Gender equality offices in universities and public administration cannot cope with the task of manually checking the use of non-inclusive language in the documentation that those institutions generate. In this research, an automated solution for the detection of non-inclusive uses of the Spanish language in doctoral theses generated in Spanish universities is introduced using machine learning techniques. A large dataset has been used to train, validate, and analyze the use of inclusive language; the result is an algorithm that detects, within any Spanish text document, non-inclusive uses of the language with error, false positive, and false negative ratios slightly over 10%, and precision, recall, and F-measure percentages over 86%. Results also show the evolution with time of the ratio of non-inclusive usages per document, having a pronounced reduction in the last years under study. © 2020 by the authors.","Classification algorithm; Inclusive language; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Spanish language",,"","Wasserman, B.D., Weseley, A.J., Qué Quoi Do languages with grammatical gender promote sexist attitudes (2009) Sex Roles, 61, p. 634; Meseguer, Á.G., (1996) Es Sexista La Lengua Española?

The exposure to sexist speech has serious consequences to women's life and limits their freedom of speech. Previous studies have focused on identifying hatred or violence towards women. However, sexism is expressed in very different forms: it includes subtle stereotypes and attitudes that, although frequently unnoticed, are extremely harmful for both women and society. In this work, we propose a new task that aims to understand and analyze how sexism, from explicit hate or violence to subtle expressions, is expressed in online conversations. To this end, we have developed and released the first dataset of sexist expressions and attitudes in Twitter in Spanish (MeTwo) and investigate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques (both traditional and novel deep learning models) for automatically detecting different types of sexist behaviours. Our results show that sexism is frequently found in many forms in social networks, that it includes a wide range of behaviours, and that it is possible to detect them using deep learning approaches. We discuss the performance of automatic classification methods to deal with different types of sexism and the generalizability of our task to other subdomains, such as misogyny. © 2013 IEEE.","machine learning; natural language processing; Sexism detection; social media",,,"Wright, M.F., Harper, B.D., Wachs, S., The associations between cyberbullying and callous-unemotional traits among adolescents: The moderating effect of online disinhibition (2019) J.

WhatsApp. Ashley Madison. Fitbit. Tinder. Periscope. How do we make sense of how apps like these-and thousands of others-have embedded themselves into our daily routines, permeating the background of ordinary life and standing at-the-ready to be used on our smartphones and tablets? When we look at any single app, it’s hard to imagine how such a small piece of software could be particularly notable. But if we look at a collection of them, we see a bigger picture that reveals how the quotidian activities apps encompass are far from banal: connecting with friends (and strangers and enemies), sharing memories (and personally identifying information), making art (and trash), navigating spaces (and reshaping places in the process). While the sheer number of apps is overwhelming, as are the range of activities they address, each one offers an opportunity for us to seek out meaning in the mundane. Appified is the first scholarly volume to examine individual apps within the wider historical and cultural context of media and cultural studies scholarship, attuned to issues of politics and power, identity and the everyday. © 2018 by Jeremy Wade Morris and Sarah Murray.
