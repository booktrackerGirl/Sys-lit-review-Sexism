This gave a lot of results in different fields, which on closer inspection, looked irrelevant for the search analysis. So it was modified to the following.

```misogyny  AND detection  OR  misogyny  AND identification  OR  misogyny  AND prediction  OR  misogyny  AND classification  OR  sexism  AND detection  OR  sexism  AND identification  OR  sexism  AND prediction  OR  sexism  AND classification  AND  ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2022 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2021 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2020 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2019 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2018 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2017 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2016 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2015 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2014 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2013 ) )```

Number of search results: 441 <i>This includes all the disciplines</i>
