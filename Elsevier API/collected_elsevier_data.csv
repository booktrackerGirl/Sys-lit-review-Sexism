0,"The Scale of Ethical Attitude toward Ethnic Humor (EATEH): Development, Reliability, and Validity","Research on ethnic humor has been centered on initiators and functions of ethnic humor, ignoring people’s ethical attitudes toward this type of humor. The purpose of the present article was to develop a scale measuring the ethical attitude toward ethnic humor, named EATEH (study 1). Further, we evaluated its relation to personal distress, empathic concern, perspective taking, authoritarianism, and self-efficacy (study 2). Exploratory factor analysis favored a one-factor structure, interpreted as a general ethical attitude toward ethnic humor that accounted for 55.9% of the total variance. EATEH obtained Cronbach’s alpha of .94, indicating a high reliability. Multiple regression analysis showed that EATEH had considerable unique variance that was not explained by the tested psychological constructs (study 2). Hence, our scale is a novel and objective measure for evaluating ethical attitude toward ethnic humor.",,2013,77,5,0,True,,0,1391152009,E. F. Haghish,11363455,Arash Heydari,2001444,G.

1,A Feminist Pentecostal Theological Anthropology: North America and Beyond,"Abstract In this article I focus on developing a feminist Pentecostal theological anthropology that can benefit Pentecostal women. I begin by highlighting various Pentecostal scholars whose anthropologies adopt the approaches of the imago Dei (a theo-logical approach) and the imago Christi (a christological approach). For all the merits that these two approaches have, they are ultimately inadequate on their own for Pentecostals as they have been presented thus far, because they lack a strong pneumatological component. Therefore, I expand the traditional theo-logical and christological approaches by highlighting the role of the Spirit in constituting the imago Dei and imago Christi, and by articulating a third way, the imago Spiritus, which enables pneumatology to stand on its own as a further approach to affirming women’s full humanity. I conclude by highlighting some of the issues Pentecostal women face globally and note how this anthropology can be beneficial for Pentecostal women worldwide.",,2013,1,1,0,False,,1,40164727,Lisa P.

2,"Dying to Get Out of the Asylum: Mortality and Madness in Four Mental Hospitals in Victorian Canada, c. 1841–1891","This article examines the status of lunatic cadavers during the second half of the nineteenth century. The first section summarizes cause of death data of over three thousand patients who were admitted to the four principal lunatic asylums in the province of Ontario (Canada). The results illuminate the alleged causes of death, revealing, among other factors, the impact of tuberculosis and general paralysis of the insane. The data also suggest that there was a steady increase in life chances of those entering the mental hospital over the five decades under study. The second section of the article investigates the tension between medical schools and asylum superintendents as educational requirements for nineteenth-century medical education necessitated more and more material for dissection, elevating the status of alienists as gatekeepers to cadavers. The article then concludes by reflecting on what implications these findings have for our understanding of the Victorian lunatic asylum.",Bulletin of The History of Medicine,2013,74,4,1,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Cause of death data of over three thousand patients who were admitted to the four principal lunatic asylums in the province of Ontario (Canada) illuminate the alleged causes of death, revealing the impact of tuberculosis and general paralysis of the insane.'}",2,2144036837,D.

3,"Citizenship without representation? Blackface, misogyny and parody in Die Antwoord, Lupé Fiasco and Angel Haze","Abstract This article explores Die Antwoord's blackface politics to question whether the concept of citizenship has any value in a context where marginal artists’ attempts to represent themselves on their own terms are overshadowed by the global reach of corporate entertainment media monopolies, and by the legacy of racism and sexism in the music industry. It analyses the work of Die Antwoord, Lupé Fiasco and Angel Haze to contend that global capital undermines the nation-state's ability to secure its citizens’ economic or cultural interests. Using Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's concept of Empire, the author argues that corporate globalisation undermines the sovereignty of the nation-state, effectively compromising democratic ideals. The global appeal of Die Antwoord tells us a great deal about the extent to which diverse cultural expressions are marginalised, as well as the extent to which colonial conceptions of race, gender and class endear in public discourse – specifically in light of the continuing appeal of blackface in the mainstream entertainment industry.",,2013,41,2,0,False,,3,73721487,Adam Haupt,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
4,"Schools, Sex Education, and Support for Sexual Minorities: Exploring Historic Marginalization and Future Potential","School-based adolescent sexual health education in the United States has long served as a means of combating emotional and physical threats to the well-being of youth. However, this sex education has since its inception marginalized the experiences and health concerns of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students and contributed to school environments frequently hostile toward sexual minority groups. Growing concern for the welfare and educational experiences of sexual minorities suggests the need to improve school-based support for LGB students. This article explores this challenge by examining the relationship between sex education and sexual minorities. Through a review of the history of adolescent sexuality and sex education, and continuing barriers to support for LGB students, this article reveals how marginalization of LGB groups has manifested within schools and argues improving education with regards to LGB groups is necessary to develop equitable and safe educational environments. Suggestions for improving support of sexual minorities in schools and sex education are discussed.",,2013,84,40,6,False,,4,1401799456,David McCarty-Caplan,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,Review

8,Selling genital cosmetic surgery to healthy women: a multimodal discourse analysis of Australian surgical websites,"The multimodal nature of web pages enables them to interweave text, images, colour and other graphical material to create discursive contexts which may be difficult to identify or challenge. Multimodal discourse analysis provides a tool for deconstructing such websites. This paper examines websites that promote the growing practice of female genital cosmetic surgery, in particular labial reduction or labiaplasty. We examine the ways in which four Australian cosmetic surgery websites normalise unnecessary surgical intervention. From our multimodal critical discourse analysis, three themes emerged – ‘pathologising the normal’, ‘normalising modification’ and ‘cosmetic surgery is easy’. All were embedded in a neoliberal discourse of individual choice, self-improvement and objectification, through text and images that medicalised normal women's bodies, normalised the use of surgery to fit a cultural ideal of beauty and stressed the rhetoric of choice, empowerment and agency, thus creating an ideological foundation and justification for cosmetic surgery.",,2013,59,52,6,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This paper examines websites that promote the growing practice of female genital cosmetic surgery, in particular labial reduction or labiaplasty, and examines the ways in which four Australian cosmetic surgery websites normalise unnecessary surgical intervention.'}",8,14996790,Claire Moran,2115444700,Christina Lee,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
9,Factory ‘nuns’: the ethnicization of migrant labor in the making of Tibetan carpets,"Many debates over migrant labor politics in contemporary China rely upon essentialist notions of ethnic identity. In contrast, I identify migrant labor politics as transnational processes through which women migrants from rural Tibet become ethnic workers. Drawing on post-colonial theories of ethnicity and on feminist literature on global capitalism, this article analyzes the uses of migrant laborers in a globalizing Tibetan carpet industry. First, I investigate the making of Tibetan carpets and the essentialist construction of ‘carpet weavers’ employed by Tibetan–Nepalese carpet factory owners, carpet dealers in New York City, and various participants in Lhasa, including party cadres, international non-government organizations (NGOs), and overseas investors. I argue that the functioning of the international carpet business relies upon the ethnicization of migrant labor, in which labor subjugation involves creating ethnic subjects and ethnicized boundaries. This form of labor commodification is driven by both an economic logic and a moral imperative for preserving or regenerating ‘ethnic culture.’ Second, through the lens of gender, I look closely at the ethnicization of migrant labor in post-socialist Lhasa, analyzing its significance for the labor force in the carpet industry. The women carpet weavers, who mostly come from Tibet's rural areas, I found, strive to reconcile their desires for female autonomy with labor positions that reduce them to strangers in the city. Some women attempt to overcome their experiences of alienation while actively engaging in the reproduction of the patriarchal family as well as in labor hierarchies at work.",,2013,56,0,0,False,,9,49104890,T.

10,Dissociating the neural bases of repetition-priming and adaptation in the human brain for faces.,"The repetition of a given stimulus leads to the attenuation of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal compared with unrepeated stimuli, a phenomenon called fMRI adaptation or repetition suppression (RS). Previous studies have related RS of the fMRI signal behaviorally both to improved performance for the repeated stimulus (priming) and to shifts of perception away from the first stimulus (adaptation-related aftereffects). Here we used identical task (sex discrimination), trial structure [stimulus 1 (S1): 3,000 ms, interstimulus interval: 600 ms, stimulus 2 (S2): 300 ms], and S2 stimuli (androgynous faces) to test how RS of the face-specific areas of the occipito-temporal cortex relates to priming and aftereffects. By varying S1, we could induce priming (significantly faster reaction times when S1 and S2 were identical compared with different images) as well as sex-specific aftereffect [an increased ratio of male responses if S1 was a female face compared with ambiguous faces or to Fourier-randomized noise (FOU) images]. Presenting any face as S1 led to significant RS of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the fusiform and occipital face areas as well as in the lateral occipital cortex of both hemispheres compared with FOU, reflecting stimulus category-specific encoding. Additionally, while sex-specific adaptation effects were only observed in occipital face areas, primed trials led to a signal reduction in both face-selective regions. Altogether, these results suggest the differential neural mechanisms of adaptation and repetition priming.",Journal of Neurophysiology,2013,120,17,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'While sex-specific adaptation effects were only observed in occipital face areas, primed trials led to a signal reduction in both face-selective regions, suggesting the differential neural mechanisms of adaptation and repetition priming.'}",10,31647771,Daniel Kaiser,3744259,Christian Walther,2375931,S.

11,Reasons for disclosure of gender to pregnant women during prenatal ultrasonography,"Background The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of women who want to know fetal gender on antenatal ultrasonography and the reasons behind this. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out between March 10, 2012 and September 10, 2012 at two tertiary care hospitals (Dow University Hospital, Ojha Campus, and Lady Dufferin Hospital) in Karachi. In total, 223 pregnant women who attended the antenatal clinic and gave their consent were included in the study. Information was collected on a predesigned questionnaire. Results Of the 223 pregnant women, 109 (49.1%) were younger than 25 years. The majority (216, 96.9%) were Muslim, 164 (73.4%) were educated to different levels, 121 (54.3%) spoke Urdu, and 66 (29.6%) were primigravidas. Thirty-four (15.2%) women had a preference for a male child, 24 (10.8%) had a female preference, and 165 (74%) had no preference. Seventy (31.4%) women were interested to know the fetal gender. The association between education and gender preference was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.004) and also that between age and gender preference (P = 0.05), but no relationship was found between gender preference and gender of previous babies (P = 0.317 for males and P = 0.451 for females).

15,Difficulties of integrating older workers into the labor market: exploring the Israeli labor market,"Purpose – The purpose of this article is to examine the existence of biased stereotypes about older workers. What are the economic implications of such biased stereotypes? Finally, what policy measures are required in order to achieve efficiency in the labor market? Design/methodology/approach – The authors grouped 25 opinions about older workers into three categories of stereotypes. The first category dealt with the productivity of older staff. The other two categories addressed their reliability and adaptability. The authors then questioned 312 Israeli respondents about the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with the opinions. Finally, the authors examined theoretically the economic effects of biased stereotypes about older workers. Findings – The study demonstrates that individual and organizational characteristics affect employers' attitudes. Age was a significant factor in all three categories. The older the respondent, the fewer prejudices he or she had against older workers. Other characteristics such as gender, interaction with older workers, the nature of the respondent's work in the organization, the age of the employees, and the size of the organization were all significant, but not always, and not in all three categories. The findings imply that there are biased stereotypes about older workers, so the allocation of workers is distorted, which leads to a failure of the market. Originality/value – The results strengthen the economic justification for policy intervention to correct the distorted level of employment of older workers in the labor market.",,2013,27,20,0,False,,15,22273530,Hila Axelrad,40126724,Israel Luski,118958906,Malul Miki,,,,,,,Economics,

17,"Reclaiming the Public Space: Breastfeeding Rights, Protection, and Social Attitudes","Breastfeeding is a normal physiological process. Despite the literature that indicates the importance of breastfeeding in terms of maternal and infant health, there is still opposition to women breastfeeding in public spaces. This manifests itself in private commercial establishments preventing mothers from breastfeeding or ordering them to stop. Mothers are thereby discouraged from feeding in public or in private spaces open to the public (quasi-public spaces). In this article, the authors advocate for stronger legal protections for mothers who seek to breastfeed in public or quasi-public spaces. While breastfeeding in such spaces is implicitly protected under human rights law, this in itself does not send a strong enough message. Accordingly governments should amend human rights legislation to explicitly recognize the right to breastfeed in public and quasi-public spaces. Furthermore, the authors contend that governments should make it an offence to prohibit or prevent women from breastfeeding in public or quasi-public spaces. Punishment for breach of the offence could result in a substantial fine. Importantly, it would place the onus of the litigation on the Crown and relieve mothers who are already burdened from having to litigate the matter. It would also demonstrate the State’s interest in assisting those who may be more vulnerable.",,2013,0,2,0,False,,17,104966726,Amar Khoday,13355353,A. Srinivasan,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

Various investigations over time have analysed and studied this problem from different perspectives, taking into account both the aggressors and the victims. However, apart from these perspectives there are other approaches that have been less explored. This study analyses the phenomenon from a cultural point of view. It looks at the way in which variables such as hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and the perception of severity attributed to violent behaviour perpetrated by the aggressor can differ depending on the country of origin of a group of victimized adolescent women, specifically, from Spain and Ecuador. The data analysis, based on the construction of a moderated mediation model, revealed that while hostile sexism seems to be linked to a greater extent with traditional cultures, benevolent sexism is highly relevant in today’s society, and modifies the severity that young female victims attribute to violent behaviour and ultimately affects the frequency of victimization. These results revealed the importance of culture and the way in which violence is perceived in different countries as an essential aspect that must be taken into account to guide the construction of effective prevention programs adapted to the specific target groups of adolescents.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,92,0,0,True,,18,1398947095,I.

19,Models for Aggression by Police Officers towards Romantic Partners and Police Partners,"Past research documents that occupational challenges faced by police officers may increase the risk of aggression toward romantic partners, but little research is available on aggression by police officers in another close relationship, that occurring within the ‘fraternal order’, toward their police partners. The purpose of the present study was to enhance understanding of police aggression in close relationships by comparing ‘models' of aggression suggested by Social Learning Theory, including powerful others or peers from the ‘home family’ (father, mother, siblings) and from the ‘police family’ (police supervisor, police partner). Participants included 120 police officers (95 per cent male; mean age = 38.9 years; 90 per cent Caucasian) who completed anonymous questionnaires to report aggression in each relationship using the 12-item Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. Multiple regression revealed that the set of ‘home family’ and ‘police family’ models of aggression explained 35.5 per cent of the variance in romantic partner aggression and 59.1 per cent of the variance in police partner aggression reported by officers, with aggression from the father and the police supervisor being the most significant models of aggression. Results suggest that in terms of aggression used as a conflict resolution strategy in close relationships, police officers experience less of a ‘fraternal order’ than a ‘paternal order’, with ‘father-figure’ individuals serving as the most significant models. Employee Assistance Programmes to encourage ‘PEACE IN THE FAMILY’ for police may require participation by police supervisors, who must also work to model non-aggressive means of conflict resolution within their departments.",,2013,19,3,1,False,,19,145347561,S.

24,Emerging Therapeutic Enhancement Enabling Health Technologies and Their Discourses: What Is Discussed within the Health Domain?,"So far, the very meaning of health and therefore, treatment and rehabilitation is benchmarked to the normal or species-typical body. We expect certain abilities in members of a species; we expect humans to walk but not to fly, but a bird we expect to fly. However, increasingly therapeutic interventions have the potential to give recipients beyond species-typical body related abilities (therapeutic enhancements, TE). We believe that the perfect storm of TE, the shift in ability expectations toward beyond species-typical body abilities, and the increasing desire of health consumers to shape the health system will increasingly influence various aspects of health care practice, policy, and scholarship. We employed qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate among others how human enhancement, neuro/cognitive enhancement, brain machine interfaces, and social robot discourses cover (a) healthcare, healthcare policy, and healthcare ethics, (b) disability and (c) health consumers and how visible various assessment fields are within Neuro/Cogno/Human enhancement and within the BMI and social robotics discourse. We found that health care, as such, is little discussed, as are health care policy and ethics; that the term consumers (but not health consumers) is used; that technology, impact and needs assessment is absent; and that the imagery of disabled people is primarily a medical one.

26,Towards an Integrated Information System for Retail Management,"Retail management recognise the competitive edge that can be provided by actionable information. In moving towards an integrated retail management information system, it is recognised that a general driving force behind investments in information technology (IT) is the need for more detailed information about customers. Marketing (and distribution and service) can apply IT to increase their efficiency, and, more importantly, to promote their effectiveness in the increasingly competitive environment. It is argued that a management information-system should be viewed as ‘emancipatory’, permitting new decisionmaking processes, and that data from recent developments such as charge cards and electronic point of sales systems offer new opportunities. Attention focuses initially on the marketing function requirements for information about the local demand for goods and services and about the competitive position. It is suggested that real progress, driven by this external marketing perspective, will only occur through development of an integrated information-system (and that the necessary integration will require the framework of knowledge-based management-systems, rather than conventional data-based management-systems).",,1989,11,4,0,False,,26,2211604,J.

27,"Women’s friendships at work: power, possibilities and potential","In this paper we explore senior women’s experiences of friendships with other women at work, guided by the following research questions: how do senior women construct friendship? How do they experience friendships and intra-gender friendships with women at work and how do gendered contexts facilitate or constrain women’s friendships with women in organizations? Of particular interest to our study is the potential instrumentality of work friendships in developing women’s homosociality and/or challenging hegemonic masculinity in organizations. We draw upon qualitative data from a wider study of 81 senior women, exploring women’s relations with women at work in the areas of friendship, competition, ambition and cooperation. We begin by outlining what we understand as elements of gendered contexts: our position on gender and hegemonic masculinity, homosociality and homosocial desire within patriarchal organizations and explain homophily as social processes of friendship which take place within these gendered contexts. We then outline our qualitative research approach with senior women working in UK based organisations and present our findings, drawing upon extracts from the women’s interviews and provide our theoretical and practice contributions. Specifically we contribute to HRD and gender in management research by highlighting how senior women construct friendship and how and why they mark the social boundary of friendship inside and outside work. We consider the impact of the findings, where over half the senior women do not ‘do friendship’ at work, on women’s potential for instrumental homosociality as a means of challenging the gendered status quo in organizations and identify areas for future research.

34,Systematic Theology,"In his classic work Method in Theology, Bernard Lonergan left many questions unanswered in regard to his treatment of systematics. In What Is Systematic Theology? Robert M. Doran attempts to articulate and respond to these questions. Doran begins by accepting four emphases presented by Lonergan concerning systematics: first, that its principal function is the hypothetical and analogical understanding of the mysteries of faith; second, that it should begin with those mysteries of faith that have received dogmatic status; third, that it must proceed in the 'order of teaching' rather than the 'order of discovery'; and last, that it must be explanatory rather than merely descriptive. He then addresses questions that are raised by each of these emphases. What Is Systematic Theology? is the most thorough attempt undertaken to date to advance Lonergan's program for systematics, fully in the spirit of his work but addressing issues that he left to others. Doran's idea of a core set of meanings for systematics - or a 'unified field structure' - is highly original, as is the integration of the systematic ideal and contemporary historical consciousness.",NTT Journal for Theology and the Study of Religion,2020,0,456,20,False,,34,115638846,R.

38,The Behavior of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs,"An idealized model has been developed for the purpose of studying the characteristic behavioroja permeable medium which contains regions which contribute sigizificantly to tbe pore volume O! the system but contribute negligibly to the flow capacity; e.g., a naturally fractured or vugular reservoir, Vnsteady-state flow in this model reservoir has been investigated analytically. The pressure buiid-up performance has been examined insomedetait; and, a technique foranalyzing tbebuild.up data to evaluate the desired parameters has been suggested. The use of this ap$roacb in the interpretation of field data has been discussed. As a result of this study, the following general conclusions can be drawn: 1. Two parameters are sufficient to characterize the deviation of the behavior of a medium with “double porosity ”from that of a homogeneously porous medium. 2. These Parameters can be evaluated by the proper analy~is of pressure buildup data ob~ained from adequately designed tests. 3. Since the build-up curve associated with this type of porous system is similar to that obtained from a stratified reservoir, an unambiguous interpretation is not possible without additional information. 4, Dif@rencing methods which utilize pressure data from the /inal stages of a buik-kp test should be used with extreme caution. INTRODUCTION In order to plan a sound exploitation program or a successful secondary-recovery pro ject, sufficient reliable information concerning the nature of the reservoir-fluid system must be available. Sincef it is evident chat an adequate description of the reservoir rock is necessary if this condition is to be fulfilled, the present investigation was undertaken for the purpose of improving the fluid-flow characterization, based on normally available data, ofs particular porous medium.

It : later became evident that the concept of directional permeability was of more thin academic interest; consequently, the de$ee of permeability anisotropy and the orientation of the principal axes of permeability were accepted as basic parameters governing reservoir performance. 1,2 More recently, 3“6 it was recognized that at least one additional parameter was required to depict the behavior of a porous system containing region,s which contributed significantly to the pore volume but contributed negligibly to the flow capacity. Microscopically, these regions could be “dead-end” or “storage” pores or, microscopically, they could be discrete volumes of lowpermeability inatrix rock combined with natural fissures in a reservoir. It is obvious thst some provision for the ;.ncIusion of all the indicated parameters, as weIl as their spatial vstiations$ must be made if a truly useful, conceptual model of a reaetvoir is to be developed. A dichotomy Qf the internaI voids of reservoir rocks has been suggested, r~s These two classes of porosity can be described as follows: a. Primary porosity is intergranular and controlled by deposition and Iithification. It ie highly intercoririected arid “usually can be correlated with permeability since it is largely dependent on the geometry, size distribution and spatial distribution of the grains. The void systems of sands, sandstones and oolitic limestones are typical of this type. b. Secondary porosity is foramenular and is controlled by fracturing, jointing and/or solution in circulating water although it may be modified by infilling as a result of precipitation. It is not highly interconnected and usually cannot be correlated with permeability. Solution channels or vugular voids developed during weathering or buriaI in sedimentary basins are indigenous to carbonate rocks such as limestones or dolomites. Joints or fissures which occur in massive, extensive formations composed of shale, siltstone, schist, limestone or dolomite are generally vertical, and they are ascribed to tensional failure, during mechanical deformation (the permeability associated with this type of void system is often anisotropic).

39,"I Drum, Therefore I Am: Being and Becoming a Drummer by Gareth Dylan Smith (review)","I Drum, Therefore I Am: Being and Becoming a Drummer. By Gareth Dylan Smith. (SEMPRE Studies in the Psychology of Music.) Farnham, Surrey, Eng.: Ashgate, 2013. [xiv, 209 p. ISBN 9781409447948. $99.95.] Illustrations, appendices, bibliography, discography, index.Relatively few scholars pursue the study of percussion instruments, likely because the primary instruments of most music scholars are voice, string, wind, or keyboard instruments. Similarly, popular music scholars often fail to include thoughtful dis- cussion of drums. There are a few notable exceptions-Steven Baur, Theo Cateforis, and Ingrid Monson have each contributed to the conversation on the role of drums in popular music. The work of Gareth Dylan Smith (no relation to this reviewer) sug- gests that the tides are shifting. He success- fully completes the difficult task of writing the first monograph concentrating exclu- sively on kit drummers in I Drum, Therefore I Am.Smith focuses on the identities of drum set players, seeking to answer the research question ""how are drummers 'drummers' and how do they learn to play?"" (p. 2). Adapting a new framework for discussing identity, which he terms the Snowball Self, Smith examines ways that learning, experi- ence, gender, and ethnicity influence drummers' self-conceptions. He employs various qualitative research methods; namely, he uses questionnaires and personal interviews to collect data from both teenage and adult drummers in and around London. The author combines ethnographic, sociological, and music edu- cation methods, along with pop culture sources that range from drummer biogra- phies to the famous Troggs Tapes (a record- ing of in-studio banter containing heated arguments between band members), in or- der to paint a much-needed picture of what it entails to become and to be a drummer. A drummer himself from the age of thir- teen, Smith is uniquely qualified to lead the way in drum-centric academic scholarship; trailblazers in the discipline are often prac- titioners of their subjects. Smith draws not only from his experiences of playing in bands but also from his involvement in education by including anecdotes about lessons and classes he has both taken and taught.In his first chapter, Smith not only out- lines goals, methodologies, and back- ground scholarship, but he also explores some of the myths and stereotypes attached to drummers, observing that they are among the most teased, ridiculed, and mis- understood instrumentalists. Chapter 2, ""The Snowball Self,"" serves as an in-depth description of Smith's framework for theo- rizing identity. Drawing from G. W. F. Hegel (specifically Phenomenology of Mind [1807; reprint, London: George Allen & Unwin, 1910]), Etienne Wenger (Communi- ties of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998]), and others, Smith views identity formation as a cyclical process in which different levels of identities- meta-identities and contextual identities- grow and change through both active and passive forms of identity realization and learning realization. The diagram on page 22 excellently illustrates his theory, showing that all types of realizations can flow to and from one another, and that they all affect identity. The words ""time,"" ""culture,"" and ""space"" appear in the background, remind- ing the audience that these three factors are at play in the Snowball Self. Smith's model is particularly well suited to provid- ing insights into how identity works be- cause the theory allows for so many factors to both influence the active, dynamic na- ture of identity and highlight the individual nature of it.Smith then investigates how drummers get started in their trade in his third chap- ter, ""Learning to Play Drums."" He demon- strates that drummers participate in most types of learning (including formal, infor- mal, group, visual, and aural learning). Next, he explores how drummers negotiate a small canon of revered performers in or- der to position themselves among one an- other, showing the role of influences on drummers. …",,2013,0,8,3,False,,39,2115932599,Mandy Smith,,,,,,,,,,,"Art, Sociology",Review

There appears to be no research specifically examining Australian social work students' attitudes towards homosexuality and homosexual parenting. This article reports on a study of final year social work students in the undergraduate social work programme at one university in the State of Victoria. This study investigated student attitudes to homosexuality, and their knowledge and attitudes toward homosexual parenting as an alternative family unit via the administration of a questionnaire containing a number of scales and questions, some in response to a case vignette involving couples of different sexual orientations (lesbian, gay and heterosexual). It was found that most of the students had liberal attitudes toward homosexuality and homosexual parenting, and had high levels of knowledge about homosexual parenting. Students were generally favourable towards all three couples in the vignettes, but rated lesbian parents followed by gay parents most highly. It was found that the inclusion of the topic of homosexuality within the social work curriculum was extremely minimal. These findings are discussed within the context of previous research. The implications of the findings for curriculum development and directions for future research are also discussed.",,2006,58,94,13,False,,42,118342406,P. Camilleri,48888129,M.

43,"Effects of Research Funding, Gender and Type of Position on Research Collaboration Networks: A Micro-level Study of Cancer Research at Lund University","The aim of this study is to analyse the extent of which different types of research funding, gender and type of position have an effect on the size and density of research collaboration networks. The material consists of 3,306 documents by scientists doing cancer research at Lund University, indexed in the Web of Science databases. The author and address fields were analysed, by studying frequencies and distribution of authors and organizations, and by conducting co-authorship analyses on the organizational level. The results show substantial differences between scientists with funding from the Swedish Cancer Society (SCS) in comparison with those without SCS funding. When comparing men and women, as well as scientists with preclinical positions and those combining clinical and pre-clinical work; there are larger differences between e.g. women with or without SCS funding than between men and women with SCS funding. The general applicability of these results might be limited; they only take one certain kind of funding into account and they analyses are performed on documents coming out of one particular context. In this case, however, the results suggest that research funding have a larger impact on the size and nature of research collaboration networks than gender or type of position.

46,Contrast negation differentiates visual pathways underlying dynamic and invariant facial processing.,"Bruce and Young (1986) proposed a model for face processing that begins with structural encoding, followed by a split into two processing streams: one for the dynamic aspects of the face (e.g., facial expressions of emotion) and the other for the invariant aspects of the face (e.g., gender, identity). Yet how this is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we took a psychophysical approach using contrast negation to test the Bruce and Young model. Previous research suggests that contrast negation impairs processing of invariant features (e.g., gender) but not dynamic features (e.g., expression). In our first experiment, participants discriminated differences in gender and facial expressions of emotion in upright, inverted, and contrast-negated faces. Results revealed a profound impairment for contrast-negated gender discrimination, whereas expression discrimination remained relatively robust to contrast negation. To test whether this differential effect occurs during perceptual encoding, we conducted three additional experiments in which we measured aftereffects following upright, inverted, or contrast-negated face adaptation for the same discrimination task as in the first experiment. Results showed a mild impairment with contrast negation during perceptual encoding for both gender and expression, followed by a marked gender-specific deficit during contrast-negated face discrimination. Taken together, our results suggest that there are shared neural mechanisms during perceptual encoding, and at least partially separate neural mechanisms during recognition and decision making for dynamic and invariant facial-feature processing.",Journal of Vision,2013,86,16,1,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results suggest that there are shared neural mechanisms during perceptual encoding, and at least partially separate Neural mechanisms during recognition and decision making for dynamic and invariant facial-feature processing.'}",46,46317822,Pamela M.

Now, however, renewed debates surrounding contraceptives show legal and political interference with women’s sexual and reproductive autonomy may actually precede the sperm. This Article argues that, increasingly, women even thinking about having sex are defined socially and legally as “mothers.” Via this broad definition of who is a “mother,"" the State extends its reach into women’s decision-making throughout their reproductive lifetime. This Article argues that the State simultaneously devalues women’s choices to have sex for pleasure, which this Article calls desexualization, and uses medical rituals associated with motherhood, which this Article calls ritualization, to persuade women to accept the role of mother. Desexualization and ritualization signal the State’s attempt to influence women’s sexual and reproductive decision-making not only in the context of abortion but also in the areas of contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth.",,2013,76,5,0,False,,55,1405486716,Beth A.

While most adults have spaces wherein they can express themselves (be that through affiliation with different group membership, voting in elections, or freely choosing their peer cohorts), most youth do not have such spaces. Youth are often limited by outside restraints – legal, social, familial – that constrict their ability to freely express themselves, or to have spaces to engage in conversations about issues such as gender and sexuality. Because youth often lack a voice in research, conducting research with, rather than on youth is an integral aspect of critical youth studies. Being able to design and carry out research that is youth-centered is not only necessary, but also critical in creating research projects that promote voice and agency for these young people. This article examines many of the hurdles faced when seeking to conduct youth-centered research.

61,"In the Halfway House of Ill Repute: Gender Verification under a Different Name, Still No Contribution to Fair Play","The aftermath of Caster Semenya’s resounding victory in the women’s 800 m at the 2009 Athletics World Championships in Berlin highlighted the ethical and scientific flaws of gender verification in women’s athletics. It has led the governing international body of professional athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), to adopt new rules regarding athletes with differences of sexual developments (DSDs) in women’s competitions in 2011 (Regulations on Hyperandrogenism). The International Olympic Committee followed suit and adopted a similar set of rules in 2012. Locating the practice of gender verification in a history of sexist stereotyping of women athletes (in Section 1), I argue (in Section 2), following other critics, that the IAAF’s new rules suffer from the same ethical flaws as their predecessors; and specifically that they still invite and rely on qualitative measuring of an athlete’s femininity and masculinity. In the central section of this paper (Section 3), I relate the practice of gender verification to the vexing question of what constitutes an unfair advantage in sports. I suggest, first, that athletes with a DSD should be at liberty to exploit competitive advantages their conditions might confer on them, just as most athletes in most sports are at liberty to exploit their congenital traits (the only irrelevant difference being that DSDs are construed as gendered advantages). In a second step, I argue that gender segregation in sports and gender verification practices cannot both be defended by an appeal to fairness. If we want to preserve gender segregation, then we ought to give up gender verification; and if we are not prepared to give up regulation of gendered congenital advantages, then we ought to give up gender segregation in favor of a classification system that tracks genetic predisposition rather than gender.",,2013,58,11,2,False,,61,2271425,M.

62,Retention of Older Workers: Impact of Managers’ Age Norms and Stereotypes,"Delaying mandatory retirement age is one of the measures that governments across Europe propose to combat future labour force shortages. Although a growing number of older workers are willing to extend their working career, the evidence suggests that employers favour early retirement rather than retention of older workers. The current study examines how managers evaluate the desirability of postponing retirement of older workers and what is the impact of age norms and ageist stereotypes on managers’ decisions. To investigate this question, a factorial study among 238 managers in Dutch organizations was conducted. Profiles of hypothetical older workers were presented to the employers, who evaluated the desirability of keeping them in the organization for a few more years. Information on age norms and age stereotypes, collected a month before the vignette study was administered, was consecutively combined in the analysis. The results indicate that keeping older workers until the mandatory retirement age is not essential for managers. Our study also shows that age norms positively affect managers’ propensity to retain older workers.",,2013,28,77,3,False,,62,101100377,Kasia Karpinska,2495367,K. Henkens,11322160,J.

Although studies show that most rape victims talked to friends or relatives and that the victims took their advice for the next action, few studies have examined the type of advice given by college students. A sample of undergraduate students was provided with vignettes describing a hypothetical rape situation and a series of questions about their belief in rape myths, attitudes toward women, and their individual characteristics and backgrounds. Findings suggest that the attribution of less responsibility to the victim, an acquaintance assailant, victim resistance, a belief in egalitarian views of women, men, and African-Americans, were associated with an increased likelihood of advice to contact the police.

68,Gender and the subject of (anti)nuclear politics: revisiting women's campaigning against the bomb,"This article aims to rehabilitate women campaigners against nuclear weapons as a focus of study and interlocutor for feminist International Relations scholars. Highlighting the recent tendency in gender and security studies to ignore or stereotype these campaigners, I first show how their critical re-investigation has been facilitated by recent systematizations of poststructuralist-influenced feminist methodology. In this light, I then revisit the discourses circulating in women’s antinuclear activism in the 1980s before deconstructing in more detail the post-Cold War writings of Helen Caldicott and Angie Zelter. I argue that multiple, differently gendered constructions of the antinuclear campaigner were in play during the Cold War and have since been reconfigured in ways that reflect and reproduce the shift to a post-Cold War context and differences between the United States and UK. In such ways, then, women antinuclear campaigners continue to develop diverse oppositional subject positions in their efforts to challenge nuclear hegemony, in a discursive struggle worthy of attention from gender and security scholars as part of a broader, critical re-engagement with the gendered dimensions of nuclear politics.",,2013,111,11,0,True,,68,108385774,C.

70,The effects of system-justifying motives on endorsement of essentialist explanations for gender differences.,"People have a fundamental motive to view their social system as just, fair, and good and will engage in a number of strategies to rationalize the status quo (Jost & Banaji, 1994). We propose that one way in which individuals may ""justify the system"" is through endorsement of essentialist explanations, which attribute group differences to deep, essential causes. We suggest that system-justifying motives lead to greater endorsement of essentialist explanations because those explanations portray group differences as immutable. Study 1 employed an established system threat manipulation. We found that activating system-justifying motives increases both male and female participants' endorsement of essentialist explanations for gender differences and that this effect is mediated by beliefs in immutability. In Study 2, we used a goal contagion manipulation and found that both male and female participants primed with a system-justifying goal are significantly more likely to agree with essentialist explanations for gender differences. Study 3 demonstrated that providing an opportunity to explicitly reject a system threat (an alternative means of satisfying the goal to defend the system) attenuates system threat effects on endorsement of essentialist explanations, further suggesting that this process is motivated. Finally, Studies 4a and 4b dissociated the type of cause (biological vs. social) from whether group differences are portrayed as mutable versus immutable and found that system threat increases endorsement of immutable explanations, independent of the type of cause.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2013,130,107,10,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is suggested that system-justifying motives lead to greater endorsement of essentialist explanations because those explanations portray group differences as immutable, which attribute group differences to deep, essential causes.'}",70,5665433,V.

72,Deep Q-network for social robotics using emotional social signals,"Social robotics represents a branch of human-robot interaction dedicated to developing systems to control the robots to operate in unstructured environments with the presence of human beings. Social robots must interact with human beings by understanding social signals and responding appropriately to them. Most social robots are still pre-programmed, not having great ability to learn and respond with actions adequate during an interaction with humans. Recently more elaborate methods use body movements, gaze direction, and body language. However, these methods generally neglect vital signs present during an interaction, such as the human emotional state. In this article, we address the problem of developing a system to turn a robot able to decide, autonomously, what behaviors to emit in the function of the human emotional state. From one side, the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) represents a way for social robots to learn advanced models of social cognition, following a self-learning paradigm, using characteristics automatically extracted from high-dimensional sensory information. On the other side, Deep Learning (DL) models can help the robots to capture information from the environment, abstracting complex patterns from the visual information. The combination of these two techniques is known as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The purpose of this work is the development of a DRL system to promote a natural and socially acceptable interaction among humans and robots. For this, we propose an architecture, Social Robotics Deep Q-Network (SocialDQN), for teaching social robots to behave and interact appropriately with humans based on social signals, especially on human emotional states. This constitutes a relevant contribution for the area since the social signals must not only be recognized by the robot but help him to take action appropriated according to the situation presented. Characteristics extracted from people’s faces are considered for extracting the human emotional state aiming to improve the robot perception. The development and validation of the system are carried out with the support of SimDRLSR simulator. Results obtained through several tests demonstrate that the system learned satisfactorily to maximize the rewards, and consequently, the robot behaves in a socially acceptable way.",Frontiers in Robotics and AI,2022,34,0,0,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This article proposes an architecture, Social Robotics Deep Q-Network (SocialDQN), for teaching social robots to behave and interact appropriately with humans based on social signals, especially on human emotional states, and develops a DRL system to promote a natural and socially acceptable interaction among humans and robots.'}",72,66639390,J.

In particular, we focus on how an issue that has long beset women aspiring to power and leadership - the so-called 'double bind' in which aspiring women leaders must display high competence and ambition in traditionally masculine domains while maintaining sufficient femininity so as not to be disliked - was constructed in this high-profile instance. We discuss the coverage in terms of its implications for the need to create an androgynized presentation of ambition, the continuing relevance of gender stereotypes, and the mixture of threat and opportunity provided to women taking positions on 'the glass cliff'.

75,A Zombie Apocalypse: Opening Representational Spaces for Alternative Constructions of Gender and Sexuality,"Summary Zombies have become an increasingly common figure in contemporary cultural landscapes around the world and South Africa is no exception. While scholars have tended to shy away from engaging with post-apocalyptic zombie fiction, this has started to change as it became apparent that these texts offer rich possibilities for exploring alternative constructions of gender and sexuality. In the aftermath of an apocalypse, most forms of social organisation and ideological constructions are decimated and survivors are able to imagine new ways of constructing sexual and gender identities as they go about reconstituting their social worlds. By means of a feminist literary analysis of Lily Herne’s Deadlands (2011) and Death of a Saint (2012), this article explores whether these zombie texts successfully capitalise on the post-apocalyptic social ruptures in terms of their representations of gender and sexuality. It emerges that, although the texts do suggest alternative constructions, they also reinscribe and reify traditional patriarchal and heteronormative binaries.",,2013,58,8,0,False,,75,144107030,J.

For example, a tight coupling appeared when trans men began to use testosterone and obtained surgery such as breast removal; a moderate coupling was found where gender validation was sought from a sexual partner (with this being related to sexual preference identities as well as the interpretation of vaginal penetration); the loosest coupling of the gender-sexuality embodiments was linked to the liberality of the locale and whether “queer” identities could be easily adopted.

Relationships between attraction judgments and participants' own sexist beliefs as well as their experiences in romantic relationships were examined. Results show that young women considered benevolent sexist young men to be most attractive and young men considered ambivalent sexist young women to be most attractive. Congruency effects were found between these preferences and participants’ own sexist attitudes. In addition, young women’s experiences in romantic relationships significantly predicted their preference for benevolent sexist young men.

In addressing sexist dimensions of gender norms through the figure of the ‘girl’, a minor, discourses on sexualisation can help circumvent liberal objections about free choice.

91,A cross-sectional study of the beliefs and attitudes towards menstruation of Chinese undergraduate males and females in Hong Kong.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To explore the beliefs and attitudes towards menstruation of Chinese undergraduates in Hong Kong and to compare those of (1) male and female undergraduates with those of (2) undergraduates studying health-related vs. nonhealth-related programmes.


BACKGROUND
Menstruation is typically viewed as a forbidden topic or a troublesome experience. These negative beliefs and attitudes result from existing myths and taboos associated with cultural factors and health education levels.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all universities in Hong Kong. Undergraduates were invited through convenience sampling to complete a questionnaire assessing their attitudes and beliefs towards menstruation.


METHODS
A questionnaire on 'beliefs about and attitudes towards menstruation' was adopted. Questionnaires were self-administered by the respondents.


RESULTS
A total of 450 questionnaires were distributed, and a response rate of 96.6% was obtained; 416 completed questionnaires were collected and analysed. Many Chinese undergraduates agreed that menstruation is annoying, causes disability, involves prescription and proscription and is not pleasant. When comparing the beliefs and attitudes towards menstruation of Chinese male undergraduates with those of female undergraduates, females tended to disagree that menstruation should be maintained secret, but tended to agree that it was annoying. When comparing the beliefs and attitudes towards menstruation of Chinese undergraduates studying health-related programmes with those under nonhealth-related programmes, the latter group exhibited a higher level of belief in prescription and proscription for menstruation than the former group.


CONCLUSION
Chinese undergraduates in Hong Kong were influenced by the traditional Chinese culture and social environment, resulting in negative attitudes towards menstruation. This study recommends that sex education, especially reproductive health education, be extended to tertiary education.

94,The unique impact of abolition of Jim Crow laws on reducing inequities in infant death rates and implications for choice of comparison groups in analyzing societal determinants of health.,"OBJECTIVES
We explored associations between the abolition of Jim Crow laws (i.e., state laws legalizing racial discrimination overturned by the 1964 US Civil Rights Act) and birth cohort trends in infant death rates.


METHODS
We analyzed 1959 to 2006 US Black and White infant death rates within and across sets of states (polities) with and without Jim Crow laws.


RESULTS
Between 1965 and 1969, a unique convergence of Black infant death rates occurred across polities; in 1960 to 1964, the Black infant death rate was 1.19 times higher (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.20) in the Jim Crow polity than in the non-Jim Crow polity, whereas in 1970 to 1974 the rate ratio shrank to and remained at approximately 1 (with the 95% CI including 1) until 2000, when it rose to 1.10 (95% CI = 1.08, 1.12).

97,ADOLESCENT GIRLS' COGNITIVE APPRAISALS OF COPING RESPONSES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT,"Peer sexual harassment is a stressor for many girls in middle and high school. Prior research indicates that approach strategies (seeking support or confronting) are generally more effective than avoidance strategies in alleviating stress. However, the deployment of effective coping behaviors depends partly on how individuals evaluate different options (i.e., cognitive appraisal). The present study tested sociocultural (ethnicity, parents’ education), interpersonal (perceived support from peers, mother, and father), developmental (age, perspective taking), and individual (self-esteem, feminist self-identification) factors as predictors of girls’ cognitive appraisals of coping responses to sexual harassment. The sample comprised 304 girls (M age = 15.5 years, range = 14 to 18 years) from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds who reported having previously experienced sexual harassment (e.g., unwanted sexual comments or actions). Cognitive appraisals of coping were based on the reported likelihood of confronting, seeking help, or using avoidance in response to sexual harassment. Regression analyses indicated that feminist identity, self-esteem, perspective taking, perceived support, and parents’ education were variously related to appraisals of different responses.",,2013,51,25,2,False,,97,3634546,C.

98,Individual Differences in Discrimination Expectations Moderate the Impact of Target Stereotypically Black Physical Features on Racism-Related Responses in Blacks,"Two experiments assess the extent that targets’ stereotypically Black physical features and individual differences in perceiver discrimination expectations influence racism-related responses. In Experiment 1, a total of 115 Black college students read about an ambiguously racist workplace situation. Participants reported their hostile emotions and racism attributions. In Experiment 2, a total of 121 Black college students read about two White police officers who physically harm a Black male. Participants reported their experience of empathy for the Black target. In both experiments, stereotypically Black physical features of the Black target were experimentally manipulated, and individual differences in discrimination expectations were assessed. More stereotypically Black physical features elicited greater racism attributions, greater hostile emotions, and more empathy for the target; and in all cases, the impact was stronger for Blacks with low discrimination expectations relative to those with high discrimination expectations. When person-related variables are especially salient, the influence of situational factors is necessarily reduced. Specifically, our findings demonstrate the insensitivity to racism-related situational cues that may be most pervasive for Blacks with high discrimination expectations.",,2013,69,6,0,False,,98,145473553,James D.

101,Gender associations for musical instruments in nursery children: the effect of sound and image,"This paper reports on the results of a study carried out with 105 children, aged between three and four years in three nursery units in London and Surrey, UK. The aim of this study was to explore the level of association which young children have between various musical instruments, musical styles and a particular gender. However, we also aimed to investigate if and how any gender association could be affected through the addition of an image of the featured musical instrument along with the sound of the instrument being played. The study had two conditions. In condition one, children were played 14 short (10 seconds) musical excerpts, 7 classical pieces and 7 jazz/pop pieces on 7 musical instruments, which previous research had identified as having strong associations with either males or females; namely flute, violin, piano, guitar, trumpet and drums. In this condition, the children were also given the name and shown an image of the instrument featured in the excerpt. In condition two, participants heard only the sound of the instrument and were neither given a name nor shown an image. Children expressed their gender association through the use of small playing cards, each featuring the cartoon image of either a boy or girl. Our results suggested that gender associations do exist in very young children, many of whom have spent a relatively short time in the education system and the presence of an image, alongside the sound of an instrument can in some instances dramatically change the gender they assign to the individual instrument.",,2013,50,9,0,False,,101,143694413,N.

In practice, German students' willingness to move into flats which would be shared with a Turkish student is analysed by conducting a direct survey, a factorial survey and a field experiment. Results show that, independent of the method used, ethnic discrimination against Turks does not, overall, play a substantial role among university students looking for a place to stay. However, data from the factorial survey and from the field experiment reveal that ethnic discrimination does occur in specific scenarios: while male applicants, in particular, prefer places inhabited by females, this is only the case if the females are German. In sum, our analyses demonstrate that the gender dimension needs to be taken into account when investigating discrimination intentions and ethnic discrimination in the field of close private interactions.",,2013,68,40,2,True,,102,9109251,C.

103,"Teen girls, sexual double standards and ‘sexting’: Gendered value in digital image exchange","This article explores gender inequities and sexual double standards in teens’ digital image exchange, drawing on a UK qualitative research project on youth ‘sexting’. We develop a critique of ‘postfeminist’ media cultures, suggesting teen ‘sexting’ presents specific age and gender related contradictions: teen girls are called upon to produce particular forms of ‘sexy’ self display, yet face legal repercussions, moral condemnation and ‘slut shaming’ when they do so. We examine the production/circulation of gendered value and sexual morality via teens’ discussions of activities on Facebook and Blackberry. For instance, some boys accumulated ‘ratings’ by possessing and exchanging images of girls’ breasts, which operated as a form of currency and value. Girls, in contrast, largely discussed the taking, sharing or posting of such images as risky, potentially inciting blame and shame around sexual reputation (e.g. being called ‘slut’, ‘slag’ or ‘sket’). The daily negotiations of these new digitally mediated, heterosexualised, classed and raced norms of performing teen feminine and masculine desirability are considered.",,2013,72,482,47,True,,103,73456815,J.

104,"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Ageist and Sexist Double Jeopardy Portrayals in Children's Picture Books","Bandura's Social Learning Theory purports that early exposure to this social information may have an impact on children's schema development (e.g., Bandura, 2001), which may influence how children and later adults think about what it means to age and get older (e.g., what it means to be an aging woman in society). By extension, if the portrayal of aging women characters in picture books contains both ageist and sexist attitudes, then the concern is that learned double jeopardy social schemas may influence both children's and the broader society's reactions to this aging sub-population (Chappell & Havens, 1980) and personal self-efficacy toward aging (Bandura, 2011). For the purpose of the current research, a possible double jeopardy portrayal was examined for older women characters in children's picture books. Using a stratified random sampling of 90 children's picture books, results found that older book characters were depicted in only about one-third of the sampled books, and older women portrayals were generally more negative (e.g., “hag”). The current study analyzed the biased aging portrayals in children's picture books, and found evidence for double jeopardy (e.g., both ageist and sexist attitudes combined) in how aging women characters were presented in both text and imagery. Implications toward future research and education interventions that convey more positive messages about aging and being a woman aging in society will be discussed.",,2013,166,19,2,False,,104,102069030,L.

Given people's tendency to legitimate existing social arrangements, the stereotype content model (SCM) argues that ambivalence-perceiving many groups as either warm or competent, but not both-may help maintain socio-economic disparities. The association between stereotype ambivalence and income inequality in 37 cross-national samples from Europe, the Americas, Oceania, Asia, and Africa investigates how groups' overall warmth-competence, status-competence, and competition-warmth correlations vary across societies, and whether these variations associate with income inequality (Gini index).

110,"Global concerns, local negotiations and moral selves: contemporary parenting and the ‘sexualisation of childhood’ debate","Parents are contradictorily positioned within the ‘sexualisation of childhood’ debate. On the one hand, they (‘we’) are assumed to share a universal ‘concern’ about it and are urged to ‘challenge’ it through campaigning, refusing to buy inappropriate products, talking with children about ‘media messages’ and so on. On the other hand, parents – often specifically ‘mothers’ – are also held responsible for sexualisation through their irresponsible consumption. This article draws on qualitative research with parent groups to suggest that sexualisation may be a less pressing issue for parents than is often claimed: because they tend not to perceive their own children as ‘sexualised’, do not accept that goods are inherently sexualized, and subscribe to ideas about child development and ‘good parenting’ that involve letting children make decisions about such goods on their own behalf. Thus, even where parents articulate general concerns about the issue, within their own families they may opt for negotiation, compromise and subterfuge rather than overt challenge. Regardless of this, however, parents are increasingly compelled to respond to the issue, and thereby to engage in practices of ethical self-formation and individual responsibility-taking. Whilst these practices have a longer history than the sexualisation debate itself, they are framed or shaped in particular ways by it. The article indicates some problematic areas that emerged in the course of discussions with parents, such as: (self-)surveillance and critical judgement of ‘other’ girls and mothers; the obscuring of constraints on individual choice in ways that naturalise social inequalities; and the convergence of sexualisation discourse with older discourses that make women responsible for male sexual violence.",,2012,52,11,1,False,,110,145136057,L.

111,"Signification, common knowledge, and womanhood: The significs of Lady Victoria Welby and beyond","Abstract Lady Victoria Welby was born to an era when women were challenging their station as summarily subject to the discretion of the dominant male proprietors. The furtive soil of women's liberation had been enriched by the quill and fountain of epic female figures such as Abigail Adams (1744–1818, First Lady of the United States of America between, 1797–1801, promoted property rights for women), Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797 – Vindication on the Rights of Women, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters), and Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860–1935 – The Home: Its Work and Influence). The Victorian period witnessed the burgeoning of a female authority in public consciousness with vigorous support from public figures such as John Stewart Mill (1806–1873 – The Subjection of Women), who openly rejected inequality between sexes, and John Ruskin (1819–1900), who urged women to “abandon trivial feminine pursuits in order to act as a moral force in countering the ills of society” (Ruskin, Of Queen's Gardens, Sesame and Lillie, 1865). It is, therefore, not astonishing that Lady Victoria Welby's authority among semioticians emerged from her endeavours interpreting scriptures. Moral gatekeeping was fast becoming a female authority widely respected, though most prominently within the confines of the private sphere. Women were socially groomed to manage the family's moral code, shape children's character, and nurture the husband's honorable conduct (Meyrowitz 1985: 200). However, respect for women's particular authority and power within the private sphere was limited and remained ancillary to the dominance of the masculine paradigm. Though common sensibility has changed toward women's mobility within the public sphere, the socio-operative dynamics of power between genders remains asymmetrical, the scale tipped decidedly in favour of the masculine domain. Given that the social world operates to a significant degree within the ambit of symbolic elocutions, there has never been a better moment in history to apply Lady Victoria Welby's theory of significs to examine the contemporary subordination of women, and Susan Petrilli's publication of Welby's correspondence is nothing short of timely.",,2013,23,1,0,False,,111,115140703,S.

When measuring socioeconomic position, it is important to be aware of four aspects: (1) there is a lack of clarity about how socioeconomic position should be measured; (2) different types of socioeconomic position may be relevant to immigrants compared with the native-born population; (3) choices of measures of socioeconomic position in quantitative analyses often rely on data availability; and (4) different measures of socioeconomic position have different effects in population groups.

114,A Generalized Theory of Conflicting Leader Identity on Group Performance,"Abstract 
Purpose 
This chapter seeks to theoretically answer the question: under which circumstances do groups succeed under female leadership? Further, is it possible to conceptualize the engineering of groups such that group success under female leadership is a likely outcome? 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
In this chapter, I draw on identity control theory (Burke & Stets, 2009; Stets & Burke, 2005) and role congruity theory (Eagly, 2003) to discuss the implications for female leaders of the discrepancy between the female gender identity and the leader identity. Next, I draw upon status characteristics theory (Berger et al., 1972) to further illustrate the negative consequences of being a female leader. Then, drawing on group processes research, I make the explicit link between the negative expectations for female leaders on group performance through the endorsement of group members. Finally, I utilize innovative research using institutionalization of female leadership to propose a possible solution for improving group performance. 
 
 
Research implications 
I present nine testable hypotheses ready for empirical test. 
 
 
Social implications 
I propose that training materials underscoring the skills that females have as leaders can subvert the development of conflictual expectations facing female leaders, thus removing the deleterious effects on group performance. That is, if group members receive training that emphasizes the competencies and skills women bring to the group’s task and to the leadership role, then group performance will not be threatened.",,2013,85,0,0,False,,114,67068174,Christabel L.

Method: Employing a qualitative content analysis methodology (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005), the written and pictorial portrayals of girls' physical activities were analyzed in 10 children's picture books. A directed approach to content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) was employed in which the researchers began with predetermined categories that were used to code the text and images. Results: The findings indicated that the majority of the primary female characters were illustrated wearing appropriate athletic attire that would allow for physical movement. Although all of the primary female characters were depicted as excited about being physically active, 6 of the books described the movement of the primary female characters using action-oriented descriptors. The parents of the primary female characters were identified as the primary source of encouragement and peers were found to be the primary source of discouragement toward the primary female characters' physical activity or sport involvement. The physical abilities of the primary female characters were compared to male peers in 3 of the books. Conclusions: Although the 10 books studied provide young girls with imagery and text that encourage female physicality, it is apparent that more books are needed that focus on girls' involvement in sport and physical activity.

It is argued that in such subtle but salient ways the ideological construct of hegemonic masculinity is perpetuated by these teenagers, while the cultural stigma associated with homosexuality is discursively shifted only to non-masculine gay men. A process here termed recursive marginalization is used to account for these patterns. The article also aims to make a methodological point by demonstrating that corpus-based collocation analysis offers a productive means for understanding ideology, as lexical co-occurrence may shed new light on complex webs of identities, discourses and social representations in a community.",,2013,16,55,0,False,,119,103831003,Ksenija Bogetić,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
120,Domestic violence and public participation in the media: The case of citizen journalism,"Classified by former UN President Kofi Anan as probably the most shameful and pervasive 1human rights violation , domestic violence constitutes the object of inquiry of the present paper, which examines public participation in the media vis-a-vis discourses and ideologies of domestic violence. Intimate partner abuse and, more specifically, violence against women, has been widely researched in the social sciences in general, and also in relation to language and discourse in particular. The focus of research has mainly been either on the experiences and discourses of the individuals directly involved in the abuse as perpetrators or victims, or on the institutional discourse produced by the relevant social actors. Beliefs and attitudes towards violence against women have undergone an important shift in modern times; whereas abuse was formerly treated as a private affair, today it is generally agreed that it constitutes a social, public problem. Despite this shift in perspective, few studies deal with the social and public aspects of domestic violence. Exploring the social, public nature of violence against women necessarily involves moving beyond the discourse of abusers, abused and social actors involved in high-stakes institutional settings, to also examine the discourse that occurs in public spaces. The gendered discourse of male violence has been claimed to be perpetuated through ordinary talk (Stokoe 2010). This paper examines whether such gendered discourse is also sustained in the new public spaces for social debate that the new technologies provide. In doing so, it explores the social, public aspects of domestic violence. This study specifically draws from a corpus of digital comments within the newspaper genre. Digital comments are considered a form of grassroots journalism that has endowed lay citizens with the possibility to express themselves and to play a participatory role in the news making process. The participation of ordinary people in the news – which has been termed ‘citizen journalism’ – has been hailed as the main benefit resulting from digital news platforms (Turner 2010). This paper explores the discourses and ideologies of domestic violence enacted by citizen journalists in a newspaper public debate.",,2013,53,25,2,False,,120,1399221607,Patricia Bou-Franch,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
121,Spatial Variation of Wave Force Acting on a Vertical Detached Breakwater Considering Diffraction,"In this study, the analytical solution for diffraction near a vertical detached breakwater was suggested by superposing the solutions of diffraction near a semi-infinite breakwater suggested previously using linear wave theory. The solutions of wave forces acting on front, lee and composed wave forces on both side were also derived. Relative wave amplitude changed periodically in space owing to the interactions between diffracting waves and standing waves on front side and the interactions between diffracting waves from both tips of a detached breakwater on lee side. The wave forces on a vertical detached breakwater were investigated with monochromatic, uni-directional random and multi-directional random waves. The maximum composed wave force considering the forces on front and lee side reached maximum 1.6 times of wave forces which doesn’t consider diffraction. This value is larger than the maximum composed wave force of semi-infinite breakwater considering diffraction, 1.34 times, which was suggested by Jung et al. (2021). The maximum composed wave forces were calculated in the order of monochromatic, uni-directional random and multi-directional random waves in terms of intensity. It was also found that the maximum wave force of obliquely incident waves was sometimes larger than that of normally incident waves. It can be known that the considerations of diffraction, the composed wave force on both front and lee side and incident wave angle are important from this study.",Journal of Korean Society of Coastal and Ocean Engineers,2021,23,1,0,True,,121,104382305,Jae-Sang Jung,2140054703,Changhoon Lee,,,,,,,,,,
122,Host Chemical Footprints Induce Host Sex Discrimination Ability in Egg Parasitoids,"Trissolcus egg parasitoids, when perceiving the chemical footprints left on a substrate by pentatomid host bugs, adopt a motivated searching behaviour characterized by longer searching time on patches were signals are present. Once in contact with host chemical footprints, Trissolcus wasps search longer on traces left by associated hosts rather than non-associated species, and, in the former case, they search longer on traces left by females than males. Based on these evidences, we hypothesized that only associated hosts induce the ability to discriminate host sex in wasps. To test this hypothesis we investigated the ability of Trissolcus basalis, T. brochymenae, and Trissolcus sp. to distinguish female from male Nezara viridula, Murgantia histrionica, and Graphosoma semipunctatum footprints. These three pentatomid bugs were selected according to variable association levels. Bioassays were conducted on filter paper sheets, and on Brassica oleracea (broccoli) leaves. The results confirmed our hypothesis showing that wasps spent significantly more time on female rather than male traces left by associated hosts on both substrates. No differences were observed in the presence of traces left by non-associated hosts.

We conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of profile layout and more specifically gender cues on professional impression formation (n=202). The presence or absence of a photo had no impact on overall ratings or profile likability. Layout, however, interacted with gender of the profile owner in that male profiles were rated most positively with photo, female profiles without photo.

The kind of emotional expression (positive and negative) evoked by their leadership behaviors (task– and relationship– oriented) was also analyzed. Lastly, whether adolescents’ sexist beliefs affected the attribution of traits and the emotional expression towards these leaders was examined. Results showed that task-oriented traits were more characteristic of the leadership role than relationship-oriented traits. Adolescents expressed more positive emotions towards a task-oriented leader and towards a leader behaving in ways associated with both task– and relationship– oriented styles, but only for men. Finally, hostile sexism predicted fewer task-oriented traits to female leaders, more negative affect towards task-oriented male leaders and towards counter-stereotypic leaders.

127,A systematic review of risk assessment strategies for populations at high risk of engaging in violent behaviour: update 2002-8.,"BACKGROUND
This review systematically examines the research literature published in the period 2002-8 on structured violence risk assessment instruments designed for use in mental health services or the criminal justice system. It adopted much broader inclusion criteria than previous reviews in the same area in order to capture and summarise data on the widest possible range of available instruments.


OBJECTIVES
To address two questions: (1) what study characteristics are associated with a risk assessment instrument score being significantly associated with a violent outcome? and (2) which risk assessment instruments have the highest level of predictive validity for a violent outcome?


DATA SOURCES
Nineteen bibliographic databases were searched from January 2002 to April 2008, including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, British Nursing Index, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Education Resources Information Centre, The Cochrane Library and Web of Knowledge.


REVIEW METHODS
Inclusion criteria for studies were (1) evaluation of a structured risk tool; (2) outcome measure of interpersonal violence; (3) participants aged 17 years or over; and (4) participants with a mental disorder and/or at least one offence and/or at least one indictable offence. A series of bivariate analyses using either a chi-squared test or Spearman's rank-order correlation were conducted to explore associations between study characteristics and outcomes. Data from a subset of studies reporting area under the curve (AUC) analysis were combined to provide estimates of mean validity.


RESULTS
For the overall set of included studies (n = 959), over three-quarters (77%) were conducted in the USA, Canada or the UK. Two-thirds of all studies were conducted with offenders who had either no formal mental health diagnosis (43%) or forensic samples with a formal diagnosis (25%). The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised was tested in the largest number of studies (n = 192). Most studies (78%) reported a statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationship between the instrument score and a violent outcome. Prospective data collection (chi-squared = 4.4, p = 0.035), number of people recruited (U = 27.8, p = 0.012) and number of participants at end point (U = 26.9, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with predictive validity. For those instruments tested in five or more studies reporting AUC values, the General Statistical Information on Recidivism instrument had the highest mean AUC (0.73).


LIMITATIONS
Agreement between pairs of reviewers in the initial pilot exercises was good but less than perfect, so discrepancies may be present given the complexity and subjectivity of some aspects of violence research. Only five of the seven calendar years (2003-7) are completely covered, with partial coverage of 2002 and 2008. There is no weighting for sample or effect sizes when results from studies are aggregated.


CONCLUSIONS
A very large number of studies examining the relationship between a structured instrument and a violent outcome were published in this relatively short 7-year period. The general quality of the literature is weak in places (e.g. over-reliance on cross-sectional designs) and a vast range of distinct instruments have been tested to varying degrees. However, there is evidence of some convergence around a small number of high-performing instruments and identification of the components of a high-quality evaluation approach, including AUC analysis. The upper limits (AUC ≥ 0.85) of instrument-based prediction have probably been achieved and are unlikely to be exceeded using instruments alone.

134,Hoda Barakat's Tiller of the Waters and The Stone of Laughter: A Reflection on Gender and Sexism in Times of Wars,"This paper aims at examining Hoda Barakat’s exploration of the civil war in Lebanon and its effect on the self, the memory, and masculinity of the common man. Unlike War Literature, neither of the two novels at hand examines the sectarian division, or who to blame; it is rather the drama of the individual that shapes the two books. War here is shown to affect man’s acceptance and understanding of himself, as much as of his country. Barakat willingly estranges herself and her protagonist to delve deep into the past and scrutinize the marginalized self. The different perspective, the new tone, as well as the wisdom gained through years of exposure to dangers, enable Barakat to probe into the disturbed self of the protagonist where she tries to replicate his suffering and sense of loss. Essentially written in Arabic, the two novels reveal the desolate condition of the protagonist and the city as a microcosm of the devastating state of the Arabs; peoples and countries. The emasculated protagonist stands both as a reflection of the defenseless, powerless, unmotivated Arabs, and an opposition to the over masculinized, enraged and therefore, aggressive Arabs who want a change of the status quo, no matter how destructive, or even how efficient. Hence the paper discusses issues that are “routinely forgotten and swept under the rug”, an examination that highlights the Arab intellectuals’ apprehension with all the tribulations of their communities.",,2013,19,0,0,False,,134,145578083,F.

Research on the social functions of humour has contributed valuable information not only on the positive psychological effect of humour, but also on the understanding of social interaction patterns and the dynamics of group structure (Martineau, 1972, p. 103). Studies from the West have indicated that humour is highly recognised as a powerful discourse to be used to wield power in workplace setting (Sollit-Morris, 1997; Holmes & Marra, 2002a; Holmes & Stubbe, 2003; Arfeen, 2009). This study investigates the functions of humour and the enactment of power amongst academics in asymmetrical relations. The parameters of this study are confined to the different status position of the participants who use humour to wield power during academic management meetings. Data for the study were collected from semi-formal meetings that were recorded in a local university in the state of Terengganu. The instances of humour elicited from the naturally-occurring discourse of the academic staff were categorised based on Hay’s Taxonomy of Functions of Humour (1995), which mainly focuses on power in discourse. The findings revealed that the production of humour in academic management meetings is highly influenced by the status or position that one occupies.",,2014,31,1,0,False,,135,67213134,J.

The study incorporates demand for premium products defined by Kapferer and Bastien [2009b. The Luxury Strategy. London: Kogan Page] as comprising a broad variety of higher quality and unique or distinctive products and brands including in grocery organic ranges, healthy options, allergy free selections, and international and gourmet/specialty products through an online grocery model (n = 356) that integrates a novel view of home delivery in Istanbul. More importantly from a logistic perspective our model incorporates any products from any online vendors broadening the range beyond listed items found in any traditional online supermarkets. Data collected via phone survey and analysed via structural equation modelling suggest that the offer of online premium products significantly affects consumers’ delivery logistics expectations. We discuss logistics operations and business management implications, identifying the emerging geography of logistic models which respond to consumers’ unmet expectations using multiple sourcing and consolidation points.",,2016,86,19,1,True,,137,1671831563,Ronan de Kervenoael,143906222,Seda Yanık,2724666,B.

139,Female public Jordanian university undergraduate students' intentions and attitudes toward breastfeeding: application of self-objectification theory.,"BACKGROUND
Breastfeeding is the natural way of feeding infants and an important public health issue. Representation women as sexual objects by highlighting their bodies as mainly for the desire of men causes women to prioritise their physical appearance and internalise sexual objectification of their bodies. Such ideologies make women less comfortable to accept other functions of their bodies such as the reproductive functions, including breastfeeding and childbirth.


OBJECTIVES
To describe, in a sample of female undergraduate students, attitudes toward breastfeeding, level of self-objectification and to examine whether women's attitudes and the intention of breastfeeding is related to the level of self-objectification.


METHODS
An exploratory, cross-sectional design was used. All female undergraduate university students, attending a large university in the Northern part of Jordan were eligible to participate. A convenience sample of 600 female students from both health professional and non-health professional schools were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire designed to collect data on students' intentions and attitudes toward breastfeeding and self-objectification, with a response rate of 82.6% (n=496). Ethical approval was obtained from the Scientific Research Board of the Jordan University of Science and Technology prior to the start of the study.


RESULTS
The majority of the students gave favourable responses towards the attitude statements and reported a commitment to breastfeeding Students' attitudes toward breastfeeding correlated significantly with self-objectification. Participants with negative attitudes towards breastfeeding were more likely to internalise and accept the socio-cultural attitudes towards appearance (r = -0.098, p = 0.029). Participants' intention to breastfeed correlated negatively with self-objectification and those who intended to breastfeed were more likely to reject the socio-cultural attitudes towards the ""apearance"" subscale (r = 0.097, p = 0.031).

140,"Persisting gender differences and attenuating age differences in cardiovascular drug use for prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease, 1998-2010.","BACKGROUND
Evidence on recent time trends in age-gender differences in cardiovascular drug use is scarce. We studied time trends in age-gender-specific cardiovascular drug use for primary prevention, secondary prevention, and in-hospital treatment of coronary heart disease.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The PHARMO database was used for record linkage of drug dispensing, hospitalization, and population data to identify drug use between 1998 and 2010 in 1 203 290 persons ≥25 years eligible for primary prevention, 84 621 persons hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and 15 651 persons eligible for secondary prevention. The use of cardiovascular drugs increased over time in all three settings. In primary prevention, the proportion of women that used lipid-lowering drugs was lower than men between 2003 and 2010 (5.7 vs. 7.3% in 2010). The higher proportion of women that used blood pressure-lowering drugs for primary prevention, compared with men, attenuated over time (15.1 vs. 13.8% in 2010). During hospital admission for an ACS, the proportion of women that used cardiovascular drugs was lower than men. In secondary prevention (36 months after hospital discharge), drug use was lowest in young women. The proportion receiving lipid-lowering drugs declined after the age of 75 in all three settings. This age difference attenuated over time.


CONCLUSION
Age differences in drug use tended to attenuate over time, whereas gender differences persisted.

A content analysis revealed that Commander in Chief's female president placed greater emphasis than The West Wing's male president on one masculine issue (crime) and one feminine issue (women's issues), whereas The West Wing's male president placed greater emphasis than Commander in Chief's female president on two masculine issues (international issues and taxes). Overall, masculine issues were depicted more often than feminine issues. Results showed that Commander in Chief's reliance on a masculine issue frame may have reinforced a masculine image of the presidency.

143,Automatic and Intentional Brain Responses during Evaluation of Face Approachability: Correlations with Trait Anxiety,"Background: The judgment of the approachability of others based on their facial appearance often precedes social interaction. Whether we ultimately approach or avoid others may depend on such judgments. Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the neural basis for such approachability judgments and the relationship between these judgments and trait anxiety. Participants viewed ambiguous (i.e. neutral) or relatively unambiguous (i.e. angry, happy) faces, assessing either the approachability or the sex of the person depicted. Results: Neutral faces elicited more inconsistent responses within participants only during approachability judgment, suggesting ambiguous property as signals. The contrast pertaining to the interaction between task and face valence demonstrated activation in several areas, such that the left amygdala and medial, middle and inferior frontal gyri were responsive to angry faces when subjects were asked to recognize the sex (implicit task) and to neutral faces when required to discern the approachability (explicit task). Moreover, the blood oxygenation level-dependent change within the left amygdala in response to neutral faces during the judgment of approachability was positively correlated with participant trait anxiety.

Western children are often deprived of these opportunities and independent mobility is constantly decreasing. In the present study, we aimed to test an integrative model of the antecedents and consequences of independent mobility and to preliminarily explore the relationship between parenting styles and independent mobility in a group of 589 Italian children. We expected and found that being female and being younger predicted less independent mobility. In turn, we found that lower independent mobility predicted greater feelings of loneliness through the mediation of a weaker sense of community, a lower sense of safety and less frequent social activities with friends. Moreover, we found that independent mobility changed according to different configurations of parenting styles.",,2013,125,39,3,False,,145,1912243,Maria Giuseppina Pacilli,6712199,I.

150,"MRCGP CSA: are the examiners biased, favouring their own by sex, ethnicity, and degree source?","BACKGROUND
Concern exists regarding differential performance of candidates in postgraduate clinical assessments by ethnicity, sex, and country of primary qualification. Could examiner bias be responsible?


AIM
To explore whether candidate demographics affect examiners' judgements, by investigating candidates' case performances by candidates' and examiners' demographics.


DESIGN AND SETTING
Data on 4000 candidates (52,000 cases) sitting the MRCGP clinical skills assessment in 2011-2012.


METHOD
Univariate analyses were undertaken of subgroup performance (male/female, white/black and minority ethnic (BME), UK/non-UK graduates) by parallel examiner demographics. Due to confounding of variables, these were complemented by multivariate ANOVA and multiple regression analyses.


RESULTS
Univariate analysis showed some differences between outcomes between the same-group and other-group examiners: these were contradictory regarding examiners 'favouring their own', for example, males received higher marks from female examiners than from males: maximum effect size was 3.6%. A six-way ANOVA confirmed all three candidate and examiner variables as having significant effects individually, identifying one significant interaction (examiner sex by examiner ethnicity). Stepwise regression showed candidate variables predicting 12% of score variance, parallel examiner demographics adding little (approximately 0.2% of variance). One 'transactional' variable proved significant, explaining 0.06% of score variance.


CONCLUSION
Examiners show no general tendency to 'favour their own kind'. With confounding between variables, as far as the impact on candidates' case scores, substantial effects relate to candidate and not examiner characteristics.

152,"‘Fatherland, Religion, Family’: Exploring the History of a Slogan in Greece, 1880–1930","Even though they can develop into powerful political slogans exercising enormous influence on public opinion, attitudes and practices, catchwords and catchphrases have their own complex, even contradictory, origins and shifting meanings. In general, slogans, as a rhetorical device, have a rich history.1 They have provided historians with topical outlines of the major concerns, frustrations and hopes of society. As ‘social symbols’, they have united, divided and even converted people. Thus, slogans have a direct link to social or individual action as well as to ‘a discursive conception of ideology’, to use Stuart Hall’s words.2 Yet little attention has been given to the rhetorical and persuasive nature of slogans. The ways catchphrases and slogans establish images and identities and convey a sense of belonging is of particular importance for a deeper understanding of the politics and culture of particular epochs and contexts. ‘Patris, Thriskeia, Oikogeneia’ (Πατρίς , Θρησκεία, Oικoγ ένεια Fatherland, Religion, Family) is one of the most familiar and influential slogans in modern and contemporary Greece. Regularly associated with the politics and propaganda of authoritarian regimes, starting from Ioannis Metaxas’ dictatorship (1936–41) up until the Colonels’ regime (1967–74), its prior history has escaped our attention. Despite its ‘familiarity’ or perhaps because of it, there has been no scholarly research on the particularities of its formation and circulation. Hence, it links to major ideological, social and political developments in modern Greek history. The main aim of this article is to focus on particular moments of importance for the formation, articulation, consolidation and circulation of this slogan. The analysis does not refer to concepts as such, that is to the various functions of ‘fatherland’, ‘religion’ or ‘family’ in Greece’s long twentieth century. Rather, it focuses on the slogan itself; that is it traces ideological currents, cultural practices and biopolitical discourses, as well as technologies and means of communication, which have contributed to the linkage of these concepts and to their mutual function. The multiple uses of the slogan throughout the twentieth century and its centrality for the development of conservative politics invite further investigation. Indeed, ‘Patris, Thriskeia, Oikogeneia’ provided the most important ideological platform for the development of the rhetoric and propaganda of authoritarian regimes in Greece in the second half of the twentieth century while it coloured all forms of social conservatism in the country during the same period.",,2013,37,11,0,False,,152,143809313,E.

154,From theoretical language to the interstices of daily practice: Reducing competency stripping through transformative teaching and learning,"As a part of the next generation of critical qualitative scholars, we hope to challenge the current connections (or lack thereof) between methodological paradigms and lived action in order to achieve marked social change. Yet we operate within institutionalised boundaries and an academic culture that does not often encourage critical interrogations of research questions or the exploration of social justice issues (Austin 2002). Giroux and Giroux (2004, 82) state that educators need a ‘new language’ in which young scholars are central to social and public transformation. This paper addresses this new language and extends the argument to include congruent daily action. Specifically, the goal of the paper is to encourage language and daily practices that promote transformative research and teaching on social justice issues in a way that mirrors our critical methodological choices. Further, we seek to address institutionalised silence regarding teaching and learning pedagogies through exploring power relationships (Foucault 1976) between rising scholars and current faculty via exploration of instructional vignettes. We argue that congruency between theoretical language and daily action may be fostered within faculty/student relationships in order to encourage future scholars to actualise a connection between reflexivity, theory and practice. We showcase the dissonance that exists between the current language with which we critically speak about our methodologies and potential transformative language among faculty and graduate students during a critical time of learning.",,2013,76,2,0,False,,154,2099552660,Penny A.

155,Factors influencing the development of an innovative service for women non-offending partners (NOPs) of male sexual offenders,"Abstract There is a paucity of published statistical information regarding women who are in relationships with men who pose a sexual risk to children. Women non-offending partners (NOPS) fulfil various important roles such as mother, stepmother, carer and supervisor, and need individual psychological formulations and programmes of therapeutic intervention to help increase their abilities to protect their children from sexual harm. This paper provides a description of an innovative service for NOPs with an emphasis upon exploring the sociopolitical context and developing a psychological understanding of the needs of this marginalised client group. We conclude that as part of a public health approach to sexual violence, academic researchers, professionals and clinicians need to work collaboratively to address the unique needs of NOPs. If, as a society, we place paramount importance, and prioritise, safeguarding children, there needs to be acknowledgement and increased resources and appropriate services, including psychological intervention for non-offending partners.",,2013,64,5,1,False,,155,144378746,K.

The present study aims to examine ambivalent sexism and empathy as determinants of male police officers' law enforcement attitudes towards PVAW. The study sample was composed by 404 male police officers. Results suggested that male police officers scoring low in benevolent sexism expressed a general preference for unconditional law enforcement (i.e. regardless of the victim's willingness to press charges against the offender), whereas those scoring high in benevolent sexism expressed a preference for conditional law enforcement (i.e. depending on the willingness of the victim to press charges against the offender). Results also showed that police officers scoring high in empathy and low in hostile sexism were those who expressed a general preference for unconditional law enforcement. The presence of sexist attitudes and low levels of empathy among some police officers, and their influence on law enforcement attitudes, highlights not only the importance of specific training, but also the need to pay attention to the selection process of police officers dealing with PVAW.",,2013,93,69,5,False,,158,2378296,M.

In this article, his story, in Camus’ The outsider, is explored as an educational challenge to a society to reflect on the territory it occupies, and the ways in which the sociopolitical machinery deals with perceived anomalies (like the character Meursault). The article explores notions of normalcy and ordinariness in relation to Meursault’s thinking and experience in order to consider the idea of what lies outside, or beyond, thinking about education. The argument here is that Meursault’s failure to intervene in his own life challenges both the ways in which we are ordinarily educated and the ways in which we ordinarily resist our education.",,2013,19,5,0,False,,160,46353571,A.

165,Consolidating the Regional Diplomacy of Côte d'Ivoire,"On every continent, regionalisation or even communitarisation 2 of foreign relations has become one of the preferred policy approaches by states and other actors in search of synergies that add value to public policies conceptualised and implemented at a geographical group or sub-group level. Côte d’Ivoire is not immune to this trend. After the glory days of its diplomacy under Félix Houphouët-Boigny and the rather more difficult period under Henri Konan Bédié, Robert Gueï and Laurent Gbago (1993–2010), the country has re-entered the international scene. While the relaunch of the regional diplomacy of Côte d’Ivoire is already showing some gains, challenges loom for the 2020 horizon when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) aims to achieve full economic and political union. i n t r o D U c t i o n Côte d’Ivoire has gone through two decades of political instability and conflict, leading to the near collapse of many of its government institutions. President Alassane Ouattara’s arrival on the political scene in 2011 heralded a renewal of Côte d’Ivoire’s foreign policy. The president’s determined focus on the region and the increased diplomatic activity associated with his term have ensured that the country has regained its regional leadership position. His approach has been two-pronged: (i) focusing on regional peace and security issues, without (ii) neglecting the pursuit of the country’s economic development objectives through active regional diplomacy. D e c i S i v e G A i n S It is difficult to qualify, or even quantify, diplomatic gains in foreign policy because the variability and uncertainty that characterise relations in the international community often render the positions and advantages gained by states precarious. The ‘anarchic’ nature of the international arena means that the definition of real diplomatic gains needs to be re-evaluated constantly. r e c o m m e n D A t i o n S • Develop an evidencebased and coherent foreign policy strategy through the iteration of a ‘white paper’ process and strengthen the country’s diplomatic oversight mechanisms. • Institute a regular (eg, biannual) conference of ambassadors to evaluate and redirect, if necessary, the country’s diplomatic activities. • Accelerate the implementation of SSR before the presidential elections in 2015. • Improve the training, development and specialisation of diplomats through an inclusive process in order to enhance national reconciliation. • Encourage more frequent policy engagement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with local experts such as academia, business and civil society organisations, as well as with other ministries. C O N S O L I D A T I N G T H E R E G I O N A L D I P L O M A C Y O F C Ô T E D ’ I V O I R E S A I I A P O L I C Y B R I E F I N G 110 2 For this reason, a diplomatic gain or advantage is considered a product or a sum of experiences upon which the state can capitalise in pursuit of its interests. The gains and comparative advantages in Côte d’Ivoire’s regional diplomacy can be divided into three broad categories: (i) historical, (ii) political and (iii) economic. In terms of historical gains, HouphouëtBoigny’s legacy remains the main asset, even though it brought with it both advantages and disadvantages. Over the course of several decades Côte d’Ivoire’s foreign policy and, specifically, its African policy, was built on the image and personification of the ‘wise old sage’ Houphouët-Boigny, and the ideals and the positions he defended continue to shape Ivorian diplomacy. His symbolic legacy gives Côte d’Ivoire a certain weight internationally, and for this reason he remains a point of reference in the political imagination of the nation. Moreover, under Houphouët-Boigny, Côte d’Ivoire was an economic powerhouse and ‘melting pot’ where immigrants from the sub-region coexisted peacefully. Ouattara, because of his knowledge of global issues and his network of contacts, has brought valuable assets to the political sphere. He previously served as the Governor of the Central Bank of West African States, Prime Minister of Côte d’Ivoire and Director of the Africa Division of the International Monetary Fund. It is therefore no surprise that he emphasises economic issues in the country’s approach towards the region. Finally, and related to the above, in the economic sphere Côte d’Ivoire can claim to play an important role at a regional level, in terms of its role both in the West African Monetary Union (Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine, or UEMOA) and in ECOWAS. This is because its economic potential can be translated into political influence, which has not always been the case in the country’s recent history. In fact, compared with Senegal, Ghana and even Burkina Faso, the political role played by Côte d’Ivoire in West Africa over the past two decades has been modest relative to its economic weight. m A J o r c h A l l e n G e S Despite Côte d’Ivoire’s modest ‘gains’ in the region, the country continues to face numerous challenges in terms of improving the ‘yield’ of its regional diplomacy. These challenges fall into two categories. The first is to contribute towards the realisation of regional and internal stability favourable to the implementation of the Ivorian government’s economic diplomacy. In Côte d’Ivoire, as elsewhere, external policy, notably its regional approach, has frequently influenced internal policymaking, just as internal policies often dictated the approach adopted in terms of its external engagement. With regard to recent policy developments in Côte d’Ivoire, it is hoped that the adoption in 2012/13 of the Urban and Rural Property Code and the Nationality Code will contribute to greater regulation of property and citizenship, with significant associated implications for the country’s stability. The approach to both these matters in terms of their application and interpretation under past dispensations has had a considerable impact on the geopolitical status and stability of the country. Other important factors that need attention to ensure the credibility of Côte d’Ivoire in the regional and international arena are the ongoing question of achieving national reconciliation, ensuring well-organised elections in 2015, and the better management of migration. Then there is the much needed security sector reform (SSR), which would enable the country to draw on armed forces that are capable and capacitated to play a regional role on a par with the country’s economic capacity. The second challenge is to mobilise, strengthen and harness the internal capacities of the country to bolster and add value to its regional diplomacy. This can be achieved by promoting inter-ministerial synergies and collegiality, carving out a more active role for Parliament in foreign policy, creating special interest groups, engaging civil society organisations and strengthening local media networks. It is also important to enhance the capacity of Côte d’Ivoire’s diplomatic corps to focus on its regional economic concerns through C O N S O L I D A T I N G T H E R E G I O N A L D I P L O M A C Y O F C Ô T E D ’ I V O I R E S A I I A P O L I C Y B R I E F I N G 110 3 specialisation. This can be achieved through the development of a coherent career path system that supports the acquisition of relevant skills and experience. Evidently, the corrosive effects of war and instability, which lasted for more than a decade, severely eroded the country’s capacity to drive active regional diplomacy. Creating an enabling framework, accompanied by strong institutions, is without doubt the key test facing Côte d’Ivoire in its quest to regain its place as the key interlocutor in francophone Africa’s diplomacy. This is particularly relevant in how it engages with the region’s premier regional economic community. 2 0 2 0 h o r i Z o n S F o r c Ô t e D ’ i v o i r e A n D e c o W A S Côte d’Ivoire’s mid-term political and overriding economic goal is to qualify as an emerging economy by 2020. While there are no fixed criteria to classify countries as emerging economies, certain characteristics are essential: an emerging economy should experience sustained and strong economic growth (generally greater than 5% over the long term); it should have a large enough population to constitute a considerable domestic market; its socio-economic structure should be characterised by the emergence of a middle class with sufficient buying power for goods and services; and it should have a diversified economy and, above all, political stability. Côte d’Ivoire does not currently enjoy this status. Nonetheless, Côte d’Ivoire shares ECOWAS’s ambition to transform West Africa into a truly integrated and prosperous region. This could be achieved by developing regional community policies that support an inclusive and participatory approach to peace and security as well as the promotion of democracy and good governance, while pursuing the promotion of intraand extra-regional trade, the growth of competitive industries, the diversification of the economy, and the improved investment attractiveness of the region and its individual members. Taking due consideration of past regional successes and failures, ECOWAS has developed a strategic plan based on the above objectives, alongside a communitarian development plan with a vision for the 2020 horizon to move ‘from an ECOWAS of states to an ECOWAS of the people’. The final outcome of the Vision 2020 is the creation of a single economic region with a single currency, central bank and a community parliament to legislate on matters of regional interest with a view to fostering peace, the rule of law and good governance. Sharing these ambitions and already occupying the position of third-largest economic power in the ECOWAS zone and first position in the UEMOA zone, Côte d’Ivoire is uniquely positioned to both contribute to and benefit from the regional economic dynamic.

168,Gender Differences in Patterns of Experienced Sexual Coercion and Associated Vulnerability Factors Among Young People in The Netherlands,"The development of effective policies and programs to prevent sexual coercion among young people requires thorough understanding of the diversity of coercive sexual experiences, patterns in such types of experiences, and similarities and differences between subgroups, especially by gender, in patterns of coercive sexual experiences and associations with potential vulnerability factors. The present online self-report study assessed a wide range of coercive sexual experiences and potential vulnerability factors among a sociodemographically diverse sample of 1,319 young people (16-25 years old) in The Netherlands. Findings confirm that sexual coercion comprises a diversity of experiences, with rates differing substantially across types of coercion. Latent class analysis revealed distinct patterns of coercive sexual experiences for young women and young men. Among young men, three patterns of experiences were found: no coercive sexual experiences, experience with verbal pressure, and experience with verbal pressure as well as coercion related to alcohol intoxication. Among young women, four patterns of coercive experiences were identified. In addition to the three patterns observed among young men, a fourth pattern encompassed experiences with verbal pressure as well as the use of force or violence. Higher numbers of sexual partners, lower levels of sexual refusal skills, and higher levels of token resistance were consistently associated with increased vulnerability.

The results highlight the importance of considering the need to provide positive male role models who provide concrete information about how to behave, as source of support and guidance, but also to provide concrete information to boys regarding what is possible for them as members of specific social groups.

Although women were historically underrepresented as principal investigators of working groups, their frequency as PIs at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis is now comparable to the national frequencies in biology and they are now equally qualified, in terms of their impact on the accumulation of ecological knowledge (as measured by the h-index). While women continue to be underrepresented as working group participants, peer-reviewed publications with gender-heterogeneous authorship teams received 34% more citations than publications produced by gender-uniform authorship teams. This suggests that peers citing these publications perceive publications that also happen to have gender-heterogeneous authorship teams as higher quality than publications with gender uniform authorship teams.

178,Gender policies and advertising and marketing practices that affect women's health,"Background The three papers of this doctoral thesis are based on the social construction of reality through the analysis of communication relating to health issues. We have analysed the contents of parliamentary, institutional, and mass media to uncover whether their communications create, transmit, and perpetuate gender biases and/or stereotypes, which may have an impact on people's health, with a particular focus on women. Objective To analyse decision making and the creation of gender awareness policies and actions affecting women's health: (1) political debates about abortion, (2) gender awareness communication campaigns and educational actions, and (3) pharmaceutical advertising strategies. Design Quantitative and qualitative methods were employed, and the research included observational studies and systematic reviews. To apply a gender perspective, we used the level of gender observation proposed by S. Harding, which states that: (1) gender is the basis of social norms and (2) gender is one of the organisers of the social structure. Results Sixty percentage of the bills concerning abortion introduced in the Spanish Parliament were initiated and led by pro-choice women's groups. Seventy-nine percent of institutional initiatives aimed at promoting equality awareness and were in the form of educational actions, while unconventional advertising accounted for 6 percent. Both initiatives focused on occupational equality, and very few actions addressed issues such as shared responsibility or public policy. With regard to pharmaceutical advertising, similar traditional male–female gender roles were used between 1975 and 2005. Conclusions Gender sensitivity continues to be essential in changing the established gender system in Spanish institutions, which has a direct and indirect impact on health. Greater participation of women in public policy and decision-making are critical for womens’ health, such as the issue of abortion. The predominance of women as the target group of institutional gender awareness campaigns proves that the gender perspective still lacks the promotion of shared responsibilities between men and women. There is a need for institutions that act as ‘policy watchdogs’ to control the gender biases in mass media and pharmaceutical marketing as well as to ensure the proper implementation and maintenance of Spanish equality laws.",Global Health Action,2013,72,7,1,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Gender sensitivity continues to be essential in changing the established gender system in Spanish institutions, which has a direct and indirect impact on health, and there is a need for institutions that act as ‘policy watchdogs’ to control the gender biases in mass media and pharmaceutical marketing.'}",178,101553660,B.

179,"Chinese Diasporic Women’s Writing, Gender and Identities","This article analyzes Maxine Hong Kingston’s The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts . how she constructs a Chinese diasporic feminist identity via autobiographical, familial, and ethnic collective remembrance. In analyzing this memoir, this article is concerned with how gender, identity and memory are interrelated and how they are performed in the Chinese diaspora in America. In rereading the memoir for personal, familial and collective remembrance practices, this essay suggests that Kingston conveys three mnemonic traces: memory as archeological excavation and memory as continuous revision and retranslation; memory as a tool to challenge and to subvert traditional gender ideology; and the relation between memory and storytelling, in which Kingston equates memory and voice with storytelling and silence with oppression. Kingston uses memory narratives as a strategic method to question traditional system of gender identities, roles and expectations. She excavates cultural and familial stories or collective memories, and then revises or retranslates them to understand her place and identities in America and in the Chinese diaspora. Kingston is conscious that the process of recovering, retranslating, and transmitting personal, familial, and ethnic collective memory is always fractured, negotiated, and a product of struggle. Hence it destabilizes constructions of identity and community formation along with knowledge production. Kingston notes that women are frequently the transmitters of memory . personal, familial, cultural, and collective. through their storytelling. This article illustrates that ethnic collective memory, like cultural identity, is a site of heterogeneity and difference, where some memories can perpetuate homeland and diasporic patriarchy while other memories can provide more liberating narratives for women and young girls. The Woman Warrior is an attempt to rewrite both Chinese diasporic memory by challenging its sexism and the national official memory of the United States by pointing to its history of gender inequality, racism, and Orientalism.",,2013,17,4,0,False,,179,35777717,Anh N.

180,Information Valuation and Confirmation Bias in Virtual Communities: Evidence from Stock Message Boards,"Virtual communities continue to play a greater role in social, political, and economic interactions. However, how users value information from these communities and how that affects their behavior and future expectations is not fully understood. Stock message boards provide an excellent setting to analyze these issues given the large user base and market uncertainty. Using data from 502 investor responses from a field experiment on one of the largest message board operators in South Korea, our analyses revealed that investors exhibit confirmation bias, whereby they preferentially treat messages that support their prior beliefs. This behavior is more pronounced for investors with higher perceived knowledge about the market and higher strength of belief i.e., sentiment toward a particular stock. We also find a negative interaction effect between the perceived knowledge and the strength of prior belief on confirmation bias. Those exhibiting confirmation bias are also more overconfident; as a result, they trade more actively and expect higher market returns than is warranted. Collectively, these results suggest that participation in virtual communities may not necessarily lead to superior financial returns.",Information systems research,2013,69,86,7,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is suggested that participation in virtual communities may not necessarily lead to superior financial returns because of confirmation bias and a negative interaction effect between the perceived knowledge and the strength of prior belief on confirmation bias.'}",180,50001617,Jaehong Park,1739328,Prabhudev Konana,144385173,B.

186,"A Campaign for Good Motherhood? Exploring Media Discourse on Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama During the 2008 Presidential Election Campaign","Purpose – Within cultural discourse, prescriptions for “good” motherhood exist. To further the analysis of these prescriptions, we examine how media conversations about Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and First Lady Michelle Obama during the 2008 presidential election campaign illustrate existing notions of good motherhood.Methods – Using qualitative content analysis techniques, we review media discourse about Palin, Clinton, and Obama during this campaign. We use existing feminist literature on motherhood and an intersectionality perspective to ground our analysis, comparing and contrasting discourse about these political figures.Findings – The 2008 campaign represented a campaign for good motherhood as much as it represented a campaign for the next president. Discourse on Palin, Clinton, and Obama creates three very different characterizations of mothers: the bad, working mother and failed supermom (Palin), the unfeeling, absent mother (Clinton), and the intensive, stay-at-home mother (Obama). The campaign reified a very narrow, ideological standard for good motherhood and did little to broaden the acceptability of mothers in politics.Value of paper – This article exemplifies the type of intersectional work that can be done in the areas of motherhood and family. Applying an intersectionality perspective in the analysis of media discourse allows us to see exactly how the 2008 campaign became a campaign for good motherhood. Moreover, until we engage in an intersectional analysis of this discourse, we might not see that the reification of good motherhood within campaign discourse is also a reification of hegemonic gender, race, class, age, and family structure locations.",,2013,38,3,0,False,,186,9889333,Heather Dillaway,46247252,Elizabeth R.

187,Why Do You Think We Don’t Get Married? Homeless Mothers in San Francisco Speak Out About Having children Outside of Marriage,"Purpose – To assess the unrelenting argument made by conservative social theorists that low-income women of color have high rates of out-of-wedlock births because they are anti-marriage and have deviant family values.Methodology – Based on a four-year ethnographic study of homeless mothers in San Francisco, this research examines whether or not Latinas and African Americans do in fact denigrate marriage and unabashedly embrace unwed motherhood.Findings – The major contribution of this research is the recognition that low-income African American women and Latinas do value the institution of marriage and prefer to be married before they have children. Unfortunately, the exigencies of poverty force many of them to delay marriage indefinitely. A lack of financial resources, the importance of economic stability, gender mistrust, domestic violence, criminality, high expectations about marriage, and concerns about divorce are common reasons given for not getting married.Research limitations – Although San Francisco is a unique city, and I cannot generalize my findings to other locales, the experiences of homeless women in the Bay Area are analogous to what was happening throughout urban America at the end of the twentieth century.Originality – For homeless mothers in San Francisco, having children without being married is a consequence of poverty in which race, class, and gender oppression conspire to prevent them from realizing their familial aspirations, pushing them further into the margins of society. Using intersectionality theory, this research debunks the Culture of Poverty perspective and analyzes why homeless mothers choose to remain unmarried.",,2013,48,4,0,False,,187,115902258,Anne R.

These data also illustrate how ad placers are unique individuals whose markers of race, class, gender, and sex identity, produce commonalities, yet how their narratives reflect diverse goals, experiences, and responses to those experiences. Women of color convey how personal advertising remains rooted in modern society where people choose their individual affiliations and continue to be defined by their group affiliations.Originality/value of chapter – Though the structural factors and social processes involved in personal advertising are relevant to the formation of interpersonal and social relationships, the phenomenon of personal advertising as a form of courtship has received relatively little attention by sociologists.

190,Why Do Racial Slurs Remain Prevalent in the Workplace? Integrating Theory on Intergroup Behavior,"Racial slurs are prevalent in organizations; however, the social context in which racial slurs are exchanged remains poorly understood. To address this limitation, we integrate three intergroup theories (social dominance, gendered prejudice, and social identity) and complement the traditional emphasis on aggressors and targets with an emphasis on observers. In three studies, we test two primary expectations: (1) when racial slurs are exchanged, whites will act in a manner more consistent with social dominance than blacks; and (2) this difference will be greater for white and black men than for white and black women. In a survey ( n = 471), we show that whites are less likely to be targets of racial slurs and are more likely to target blacks than blacks are to target them. We also show that the difference between white and black men is greater than the difference between white and black women. In an archival study that spans five years ( n = 2,480), we found that white men are more likely to observe racial slurs than are black men, and that the difference between white and black men is greater than the difference between white and black women. In a behavioral study ( n = 133), analyses showed that whites who observe racial slurs are more likely to remain silent than blacks who observe slurs. We also find that social dominance orientation (SDO) predicts observer silence and that racial identification enhances the effect of race on SDO for men, but not for women. Further, mediated moderation analyses show that SDO mediates the effect of the interaction between race, gender, and racial identification on observer silence.",Organ.

191,“Oi! Dancing Boy!”: how adolescent boys recuperate masculinity and (hetero) sexuality in dance schools and secondary schools,"This thesis is an empirical study into the experiences of young male dancers, aged 11-18 years, in the north west of England who, outside of their secondary schools, attend private-sector dance schools for tuition in one or more dance genres such as ballet, ballroom/latin-american, contemporary, jazz, tap and urban dance. Its prime focus is to explore the ways in which these young dancers contest the two dominant Western discourses that position dance as a ‘feminine’ activity (e.g. Sanderson, 2001; Stinson, 2001; Risner, 2002a; Gard, 2003) and males who dance as subject to a homosexual presumption (e.g. Rodgers, 1966; Grant, 1985; Hamilton, 1999; Risner, 2007). Data were generated from semi-structured interviews with 26 male dancers, 4 parents, 6 teachers and 4 dance policymakers / administrators. Explored through the theoretical lens of ‘inclusive masculinity theory’, characterised by a softening of masculinity and an erosion of homophobia (Anderson, 2009), data were analysed thematically (Braun and Clarke, 2006). Findings suggest that most male dancers continue to experience bullying, marginalisation and stigmatisation, especially from their male peers in secondary schools, where orthodox forms of masculinity proliferate still. While my analysis finds ‘inclusive masculinity theory’ inadequate to explain the lived experiences of most of these young male dancers, I nonetheless find much value in the related concepts of ‘masculine recuperation’ (Hansen, 1996) and ‘heterosexual recuperation’ (McCormack, 2012), these being identity-management techniques adopted by some males who transgress heteromasculine boundaries. Drawing on these 2 concepts, I pinpoint 6 strategies employed by boys to shore up their masculine and/or heterosexual identities: professing attraction to females; acquiring a ‘sporty’ boy identity; reconceptualising dance as a sport; opting for ‘cool’ dance genres; acquiring popularity through dance and, finally, the policing of movement and choreographic practices. I find that by employing some, most or all of these recuperative techniques, boys are able to contest the aforementioned dominant discourses - that dance is for females (via masculine recuperation) and that boys who dance are presumed gay (via heterosexual recuperation). Attention is also given to boys’ experiences of dance in their secondary schools. I conclude that while ostensibly a prescribed component of the P.E. curriculum (at Key Stage 3), dance continues to be marginalised and coded as a ‘feminine’ subject and one delivered mostly by non-specialist, female teachers - a problematic, discursive and material (re)production of gender normativity. Attempts to woo boys into dance via heteronormative schemes of work in schools or through external initiatives such as ‘Project B’ from the Royal Academy of Dance, are also deemed problematic in their gender essentialism. Furthermore, the philosophy of dance education in schools, one that privileges ‘process’ over ‘product’, does little to foster boys’ engagement with dance. Taken collectively, these findings are a cause for concern as well as a call to action. 3",,2019,175,1,0,False,,191,47095406,C. Marlow,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

196,Warm or competent? Improving intergroup relations by addressing threatened identities of advantaged and disadvantaged groups,"Applying the Needs-Based Model of Reconciliation to contexts of group disparity, two studies examined how messages from outgroup representatives that affirmed the warmth or competence of advantaged or disadvantaged groups influenced their members’ intergroup attitudes. Study 1 involved natural groups differing in status; Study 2 experimentally manipulated status. In both studies, advantaged-group members responded more favorably, reporting more positive outgroup attitudes and willingness to change the status quo toward equality, to messages reassuring their group’s warmth. Disadvantaged-group members responded more favorably to messages affirming their group’s competence. Study 2 further demonstrated that the effectiveness of reassuring a disadvantaged group’s competence stemmed from restoring its threatened dimension of identity, irrespective of a change of the status quo. In line with Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), these results indicate that beyond the competition over tangible resources, groups are concerned with restoring threatened dimensions of their identities. Exchanging messages that remove identity-related threats may promote not only positive intergroup attitudes but also greater willingness to act collectively for intergroup equality. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Intuition suggests that conveying positive gestures andmessages to members of another group is likely to promote positive intergroup attitudes and relations (Osgood, 1962). The Needs-Based Model of Reconciliation (Nadler & Shnabel, 2008; Shnabel & Nadler, 2008), however, further proposes that the specific contents of such positive intergroup messages are critical to shaping the resulting intergroup attitudes. Research conducted within the framework of the NeedsBased Model (Shnabel, Nadler, Ullrich, Dovidio, & Carmi, 2009) on the exchange of positive messages between victimized and perpetrating groups (e.g., Jews and Germans) has revealed that messages that satisfy the unique motivations of members of victimized and perpetrating groups were particularly effective in increasing their willingness to reconcile with each other. Specifically, members of victimized groups suffered from impairment to their sense of power and experienced an enhanced motivation for gaining power as a result. Consequently, they were more motivated to reconcile with the perpetrating group when the other group conveyed an empowering, rather than accepting, message to them. Members of perpetrating groups, in contrast, suffered from impairment to their moral image, which enhanced the anxiety of their members over social exclusion. Perpetrating groups consequently experienced an enhanced motivation for gaining *Correspondence to: Nurit Shnabel, Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv Univer E-mail: shnabeln@post.tau.ac.il Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. moral-social acceptance and therefore were more motivated to reconcile when the victimized group communicated an accepting message. The goal of the present work, consisting of two experiments, was to explore how these previous insights into psychological needs associated with victim and perpetrator roles can be applied to better understand mutual relations between advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Based on the premise that the social roles of “victims” and “perpetrators” correspond in several respects to those of advantaged and disadvantaged groups (see also Siem, von Oettingen,Mummendey, &Nadler, 2013), we incorporated general principles of intergroup perception, drawing mainly from the Stereotype Content Model (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002) and literature on the “Big-Two” (Abele, Cuddy, Judd, & Yzerbyt, 2008), to extend the Needs-Based Model to the context of status differentials between groups. In particular, we examined how the content of intergroup messages, which targeted different dimensions of disadvantaged and advantaged groups’ identities (i.e., competence or warmth) and thus addressed different motivations, influenced their members’ intergroup attitudes and willingness to act for social change. Applying the Needs-Based Model to contexts of intergroup inequality, we confronted twomajor challenges that we turn to discuss in the next two sections. sity, Ramat Aviv, Israel. Received 10 April 2012, Accepted 29 April 2013 Nurit Shnabel et al. Nature of Impaired Dimensions We suggest that much in the same way that direct violence threatens victims’ sense of power and perpetrators’moral image, group disparity threatens disadvantaged groups’ competence and advantaged groups’ warmth, the two fundamental identity dimensions identified by the Stereotype Content Model (Fiske et al., 2002). While there is strong similarity between these constructs, it is important to note that moral image and warmth, on one hand, or sense of power and competence, on the other, are not exactly the same. For example, as part of their research on agentic women, Rudman and Glick (2001) distinguished between competence and dominance, the latter referring to advancing one’s interests at the expense of others. Correspondingly, Leach, Ellemers, and Barreto (2007) showed that warmth and morality constitute separate dimensions of groups’ identities. Nevertheless, we suggest that competence and power, on one hand, and warmth and moral image, on the other, can be subsumed under the same two broad, multifaceted categories—the “Big-Two” dimensions—that underlie various social judgments and perceptions (Abele et al., 2008). We further argue that different components within the Big-Two dimensions may become more salient as a function of the specific context: In contexts of direct violence, such as the ones examined so far within the Needs-Based Model’s framework, groups may be motivated to restore their sense of power andmoral image, whereas in contexts of group disparity, they may be particularly concerned about defying their stereotypical portrayal as incompetent or cold. Indeed, competence and warmth are generally perceived in compensatory ways: When a group is perceived as high on one dimension, it tends to be perceived as low on the other (Kervyn, Yzerbyt, & Judd, 2010). Thus, disadvantaged groups are often stereotypically perceived as warm but incompetent, whereas advantaged groups are often stereotypically perceived as competent but cold and immoral (Fiske et al., 2002). Such stereotypic portrayals can arouse different identity threats among groups differing in status. Specifically, members of disadvantaged groups are likely to experience a threat to the competence dimension of their identity, whereas advantaged-groupmembers may typically experience a threat to their warmth dimension (i.e., the “moral-social dimension”; Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 2007). Consistent with this suggestion, Bergsieker, Shelton, and Richeson (2010) found that within interpersonal interactions between Blacks and Latinos (disadvantaged groups in the USA) and Whites (an advantaged group), Blacks and Latinos were motivated to gain respect, whereas Whites were motivated to be liked. The motivation to gain respect or to be liked corresponds to the removal of threats to the competence and warmth dimensions, respectively, of their identities. Whereas Bergsieker and colleagues suggested that these divergent motivations may lead to misunderstandings and negative attitudes toward individual interaction partners, the present research studied the consequences of addressing these motivations in terms of improving positive intergroup attitudes and cooperation at the group level. Meaning of Reconciliation in Contexts of Group Disparity In the field of peace psychology, positive peace represents the promotion of social arrangements that reduce social, racial, gender, and economic injustices as barriers to peace (Christie, Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Tint, Wagner, & DuNann Winter, 2008). (By contrast, negative peace refers to the cessation of direct violence.) Consistent with the definition of positive peace, we suggest that whereas in contexts of direct violence, reconciliation denotes “a changed psychological orientation toward the other” (Staub, Pearlman, Gubin, & Hagengimana, 2005, p. 301); when translated into contexts of group disparity, reconciliation may additionally mean readiness to support structural change toward equality. This additional aspect—willingness to act for social equality—is of particular importance in light of the findings that in contexts of group disparity, positive intergroup attitudes may be dissociated from collective action tendencies. Specifically, among disadvantaged groups, positive attitudes toward the advantaged group may reflect the justification of group disparity, which is related to reduced collective action tendencies (Saguy & Chernyak-Hai, 2012; Saguy, Tausch, Dovidio, & Pratto, 2009). Among advantaged groups, positive attitudes toward disadvantaged outgroups are often dissociated from willingness to act for changing the status quo to improve the situation of these outgroups because such action requires to give up power and privilege (Dixon, Durrheim, & Tredoux, 2005; Dovidio, Gaertner, & Saguy, 2008; Saguy et al., 2009). In summary, in terms of the ultimate outcomes of the reconciliation process (i.e., intergroup harmony and support for equality), the translation of groups’ willingness to reconcile into contexts of group disparity would correspond to both having positive intergroup attitudes and willingness to act for social change to eliminate group disparity. Of course, collective action toward achieving equality has different meanings, in terms of underlying motivations, for members of advantaged and disadvantaged groups. For advantaged-group members, willingness to act for social change constitutes a particularly strong indicator of “willingness to reconcile” because, beyond an abstract positive orientation toward the disadvantaged outgroup, such tendencies signify an altruistic readiness to reli",,2013,60,30,1,False,,196,6871327,Nurit Shnabel,2161392,J.

197,It's self defense: how perceived discrimination promotes employee withdrawal.,"Integrating theory on stress, stigma, and coping, the present study sheds light on how employees react to perceived discrimination (PD) in the workplace. Using three national samples, we found that PD based on race, sex, age, family obligation, and sexual orientation related to physical withdrawal (i.e., lateness, absenteeism,and intent to quit) indirectly through psychological withdrawal (i.e., burnout and engagement) such that PD corresponded in less engagement and more burnout, which related to increased lateness, absenteeism, and intent to quit [corrected].Further, these indirect relationships were moderated by employees' coping mechanisms with those who were more apt to change the situation or to avoid the stressor exhibiting weaker relationships between PD and psychological withdrawal. Though each of these studies is cross-sectional in nature and therefore cannot provide strong evidence of causal ordering of the variables in our model, the replication and extension of results over three databases and multiple forms of discrimination, coping, psychological, and physical withdrawal demonstrates that understanding the relationships explored in these studies can aid researchers and practitioners in enhancing employee quality of life and productivity.",Journal of Occupational Health Psychology,2013,77,54,3,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Replication and extension of results over three databases and multiple forms of discrimination, coping, psychological, and physical withdrawal demonstrates that understanding the relationships explored in these studies can aid researchers and practitioners in enhancing employee quality of life and productivity.'}",197,4452584,Sabrina D.

Specifically, our aim was to explore the moderating role of a unit's diversity climate in the link between unit-level surface diversity in terms of ethnicity, sex, age, and tenure, and individual-level perceptions of interpersonal aggression. We tested our hypotheses with 30 nursing units using the Mixed-Linear Model procedure appropriate for nested samples. Results demonstrated that diversity climate moderated the relationships between tenure and ethnic unit diversity and interpersonal aggression, experienced or witnessed among individual team members. Moreover, regardless of the level of diversity climate, age diversity was positively linked to interpersonal aggression, whereas sex diversity was negatively linked to it.

206,Health consequences of racist and antigay discrimination for multiple minority adolescents.,"Individuals who belong to a marginalized group and who perceive discrimination based on that group membership suffer from a variety of poor health outcomes. Many people belong to more than one marginalized group, and much less is known about the influence of multiple forms of discrimination on health outcomes. Drawing on literature describing the influence of multiple stressors, three models of combined forms of discrimination are discussed: additive, prominence, and exacerbation. The current study examined the influence of multiple forms of discrimination in a sample of African American lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) adolescents ages 14-19. Each of the three models of combined stressors were tested to determine which best describes how racist and antigay discrimination combine to predict depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and substance use. Participants were included in this analysis if they identified their ethnicity as either African American (n = 156) or African American mixed (n = 120). Mean age was 17.45 years (SD = 1.36). Results revealed both forms of mistreatment were associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among African American LGB adolescents. Racism was more strongly associated with substance use. Future intervention efforts should be targeted toward reducing discrimination and improving the social context of multiple minority adolescents, and future research with multiple minority individuals should be attuned to the multiple forms of discrimination experienced by these individuals within their environments.",Cultural diversity & ethnic minority psychology,2013,54,65,4,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results revealed both forms of mistreatment were associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among African American LGB adolescents and Racism was more strongly associated with substance use.'}",206,46391261,B.

207,"Navigating the borderlands: the roles of minority stressors, bicultural self-efficacy, and cognitive flexibility in the mental health of bisexual individuals.","The present study examined the relations of minority stressors (i.e., experiences of prejudice, expectations of stigma, internalized biphobia, outness/concealment of bisexuality) as well as posited mental health promoters (i.e., bicultural self-efficacy, cognitive flexibility) with psychological distress and well-being in a sample of 411 bisexual people. Most of the minority stress variables were related positively with psychological distress and negatively with well-being, whereas the mental health-promoting variables were related negatively with psychological distress and positively with well-being. Results also indicated that expectations of stigma mediated the associations of antibisexual prejudice with greater distress and lower well-being, internalized biphobia was related directly with greater distress and lower well-being, and outness was linked with some costs and benefits. Moderated mediation analyses offered some evidence consistent with cognitive flexibility (but not bicultural self-efficacy) as a moderator. Specifically, within the mediation models, cognitive flexibility moderated the unique direct relation of antibisexual prejudice with psychological well-being, the relation of antibisexual prejudice with expectations of stigma, and the indirect relations of antibisexual prejudice with distress and well-being through the mediating role of expectations of stigma. These moderations were consistent with the expected buffering role of cognitive flexibility, but they also revealed that some of this buffering effect is exhausted in the context of high prejudice.

We study whether this observation can be extended beyond the conventional domain of supervised learning: Can we learn a good feature representation that captures apparent similarity among instances, instead of classes, by merely asking the feature to be discriminative of individual instances? We formulate this intuition as a non-parametric classification problem at the instance-level, and use noise-contrastive estimation to tackle the computational challenges imposed by the large number of instance classes. Our experimental results demonstrate that, under unsupervised learning settings, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on ImageNet classification by a large margin. Our method is also remarkable for consistently improving test performance with more training data and better network architectures. By fine-tuning the learned feature, we further obtain competitive results for semi-supervised learning and object detection tasks.

217,Hetero-sexy self/body work and basketball: The invisible sporting women of British Pakistani Muslim heritage,"Muslim women's personal relationship with the body beneath and beyond the veil has received little attention, especially in the sporting literature.

Similarly, discussions of South Asian Muslim women's participation in sport have been more routinely informed by ethnocentric stereotypes about the ‘passive Asian woman’. In this paper I engage postcolonial feminist thinking to move beyond uncritical dichotomous re/presentations that have systematically denied diverse sporting Muslim women an identity or bodily presence outside of the discursive identity of the veil. I focus on British Muslim Pakistani women who play basketball, and explore the multifarious, dynamic ways in which these women negotiate and perform various discourses pertaining to idealised yet dramaturgical notions of ‘hetero-sexy’ femininity on and off the court.

219,Gender Role Conflict Research 30 Years Later: An Evidence-Based Diagnostic Schema to Assess Boys and Men in Counseling,"In 1981, a special issue on counseling men was published in the Journal of Counseling & Development (Scher, 1981). The special issue established, for the first time in the counseling profession, that restrictive gender roles can cause negative psychological consequences for men. In one article, ""Patterns of Gender Role Conflict and Strain: Sexism and Fear of Femininity in Men's Lives (O'Neil, 1981b),"" a conceptual model depicted six patterns of men's gender role conflict (GRC) resulting from restrictive gender roles. Over the years, this model helped counselors conceptualize men's gender role problems (O'Neil, 1981 a, 1990, 2006, 2008, 2010). The article's main point was that GRC can be psychologically dysfunctional for all people, and empirical research is needed to assess whether this assumption is a reliable fact. Furthermore, the article recommended that empirical research should assess whether the patterns of GRC in the conceptual model correlated with negative psychological outcomes for men. From 1981 to 1983, the Gender Role Conflict Scale (GRCS) was empirically developed to assess whether GRC is associated with men's psychological and interpersonal problems. Using factor analyses, four patterns of GRC were empirically derived. The GRCS was subsequently published in the journal Sex Roles (O'Neil, Helms, Gable, David, & Wrightsman, 1986) and became one of the early and subsequently most used measures of men's gender role problems. This article summarizes what is currently known about men's GRC, over 30 years after the first model was published (O'Neil, 1981b). It differs from past reviews (O'Neil, 2008, 2010; O'Neil, Good, & Holmes, 1995) by focusing on research that informs therapeutic practice with men. A diagnostic schema is presented to assess men's GRC in the contexts of gender role devaluations, restrictions, and violations. The studies from the GRC research program that supports this diagnostic schema are summarized. Recommendations are made for using this evidenced-based schema and empowering men to develop a more positive and healthy masculinity. Definitions and GRC Paradigm An extensive and full definition of GRC is beyond the scope of this article and can be found elsewhere (O'Neil, 2008, 2010; O'Neil, Good, & Holmes, 1995; O'Neil, Helms, Gable, David, & Wrightsman, 1986). GRC is defined as a psychological state in which socialized gender roles have negative consequences for the person or others. GRC occurs when rigid, sexist, or restrictive gender roles result in restriction, devaluation, or violation of others or self (O'Neil et al., 1995). The ultimate outcome of GRC is the restriction of a person's human potential or the restriction of another person's potential. GRC can be experienced intrapersonally (within self) or interpersonally when it is expressed toward others or when it is caused by others. For men, the personal experience of GRC represents the negative consequences of conforming to, deviating from, or violating the gender role norms of masculinity ideology. Three personal experiences of GRC are gender role devaluations, gender role restrictions, and gender role violations. GRC is operationally defined by four psychological domains and numerous situational contexts (O'Neil, 2008, 2010). The domains, contexts, and experience of GRC represent the complexity of GRC in people's lives. Figure 1 shows the major concepts in the GRC paradigm. In the center of Figure 1, men's gender role socialization and the masculinity ideology and norms are shown as conceptually related to men's fear of femininity. Masculinity ideology and norms are primary values and standards that define, restrict, and negatively affect boy's and men's lives. Reviews of the masculinity ideology studies (Levant & Richmond, 2007; O'Neil, 2010; O'Neil & Crapser, 2011) indicate that restrictive ways of thinking about masculine norms are significantly correlated with men's psychological problems and interpersonal conflicts. …",,2013,10,59,6,False,,219,1420053690,J.

220,Putting The Body Shop in its Place: A Studio-based Investigation into the New Sites and Sights of Organization as Experience,"Locating organizations is a difficult task, making it difficult to study them and difficult to represent that study. There is no single phenomenon of organization. We identify them through their buildings, brands, products, employees, customers, marketing materials, legal status and so on, but it is hard to identity a single unified entity. This research note argues that organization lies in our encounters with it, that is, our experience of organization which constitutes its existence. In order for scholars of organization to be able to say anything about these experiences we need a methodology designed to capture experience. The work of John Dewey is useful here with his insistence on art as experience. This note takes Dewey’s work on art and applies it to a particular case example – The Body Shop International – and demonstrates how organization studies can be enhanced through an arts or studio-based approach. Indeed, it argues, along with Dewey, that any civilized community of practice might be expected to produce art, and that the organization studies community should welcome an arts practice as a sign of its own maturity.",,2013,24,17,1,False,,221,118253188,Ayse Burcin Erarslan,38547940,B.

Epistemic injustice allows us to do the work that epistemic diversity sets out to do—that is, creating more inclusive epistemic practices that lead to more accurate descriptions of the world—without leading to the untenable and unjustified conclusions that follow from using the language of epistemic diversity. Drawing on recent work in feminist epistemology, I describe epistemic injustice and argue for its significance.

223,"German modernity, barbarous Slavs and profit‐seeking Jews: the cultural racism of nationalist liberals","This paper examines emblematic texts by two important protagonists of post-1848 liberalism in Germany, Gustav Freytag and Heinrich von Treitschke, focusing on their treatment of Jews and Poles. The paper analyses the social content of their statements and argues that the elements of anti-Semitism and anti-Slav racism that they contain were motivated by the specific kind of nationalist liberalism that frames their affirmation of the process of modernisation. This affirmation was directed against the Poles on the one hand, seen as backward Easterners who had to be pushed into civilisation by Prussian–German colonialism, and, on the other hand, the Jews, largely perceived as representing the wrong kind of modernity against which benign (supposedly German) modernity had to be protected. At the same time, the image of the Jew in Freytag and Treitschke also participates in that of the backward Easterner, permitting to see undesirable, allegedly Jewish aspects of modernity also as distortions resulting from an alien and ancient culture. This analysis has consequences for theorisations of both liberalism and nationalism: it suggests that the racism and anti-Semitism of nationalist liberals were intrinsically related to core aspects of the liberal world-view rather than being merely contingent opinions held by particular individuals. It also indicates that the nationalism of many German post-1848 liberals was ethnic as well as liberal. In this way, the paper contributes to the growing body of literature discussing the illiberal aspects of liberalism as well as the shortcomings of the long-established conceptual dichotomy of ethnic vs. liberal nationalism.",,2013,42,2,0,False,,224,104670523,D.

225,"Perceptions of male victim blame in a child sexual abuse case: effects of gender, age and need for closure","According to the gender stereotypes attributed to men, and research on adult male victims, boys subjected to sexual abuse are expected to be better able to defend themselves than girls, and are thought to be more likely to adopt a proactive attitude in the victim–perpetrator relationship. They are consequently regarded as more blameworthy than female victims. In the present study, 384 French respondents read through a sexual abuse scenario in which the child victim's gender, perpetrator's gender and victim's age (7 vs. 12 years old) were manipulated. As expected, male respondents blamed the victim more than female respondents did, especially when the victim was a boy. Furthermore, male respondents blamed the perpetrator less than female respondents did, especially when the perpetrator was a woman and the victim a boy. However, these effects were observed for victims of both 7 and 12 years old while it was expected only for the 12-year-old victims. Finally, as expected, respondents who expressed a high need for closure perceived the victim as less credible and more guilty than respondents who expressed a low need for closure, particularly when the victim was 12 years old. This cognitive characteristic thus appears to moderate the expression of stereotypical representations.",,2013,95,24,2,False,,226,11502039,J. L. Sinden,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

After viewing two of four video clips portraying RA, each participating adolescent (N = 314; Grades 8−12) answered questions related to rationalizing bullying behaviors—specifically minimizing bullying, blaming victims, and excusing bullies. Although age differences were not detected, differences in male and female perceptions were noted. Although males were more likely to minimize the impact of RA, both males and females particularly minimized the impact of male-to-male homophobic RA. In comparison to males, females expressed more sympathy for male victims and perceived bystanders as enjoying RA. Implications for bullying prevention/intervention efforts include giving greater consideration to the differences between male and female perceptions of RA; directly focusing on adolescents’ rationalizations for tolerating/condoning male homophobic bullying; and expanding beyond the bully–victim dyad to consider the broader social context surrounding bullying.",,2013,69,14,1,False,,229,9578716,Â.

229,Homophobia or sexism? A systematic review of prejudice against nonheterosexual orientation in Brazil.,"Since it was coined in the 1970s, in the United States, the term ""homophobia"" has been invoked to define the prejudice against nonheterosexual orientation. Besides the US, the phenomenon has been detected in many contemporary societies, including Brazil. Prejudice against nonheterosexual orientation is strongly associated with the historical and social contexts in which it is embedded, which means that the term should not be used without a clear definition of its local specificities. This applies to the recent debate around homophobia in the Brazilian context. In an attempt to identify existing studies of prejudice against nonheterosexual orientations in Brazil, a systematic review was conducted in SciELO indexes, PubMed, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. The articles were collected using the keyword ""homophobia"" and related terms, and ""Brazil"", in the languages of the databases. The search returned 355 articles. Of these, 247 were removed because they were duplicates. The abstracts of 109 studies published between 1973 and 2011were analyzed. Thirty-one articles were identified as relevant. The reviewed studies indicate that prejudice against nonheterosexual orientations is an evident and widespread phenomenon that is prevalent in various populations and contexts. Nevertheless, prejudice in Brazil is not homogeneous, and particular attention is necessary to the inequality of gender relations (sexism) and prejudice against gender nonconformity, which seem to explain, if not cause, most of the prejudice against nonheterosexual orientations. Although theoretically there is a clear distinction between sexual orientation and gender expression, from the standpoint of manifestation of prejudice that distinction seems to be more tenuous.",International Journal of Psychology,2013,48,55,1,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is indicated that prejudice against nonheterosexual orientations is an evident and widespread phenomenon that is prevalent in various populations and contexts, Nevertheless, prejudice in Brazil is not homogeneous, and particular attention is necessary to the inequality of gender relations and prejudice against gender nonconformity, which seem to explain, if not cause, most of the prejudice.'}",230,153556288,M.

243,Gender Research on Adult-child Discussions within Informal Engineering Environments (GRADIENT): Early Findings,"Exploring the gender differences in how children develop early interest and understanding in engineering can provide useful information for the ongoing efforts to address the low numbers of women who pursue engineering careers. By the time girls reach middle school, they are already much less likely to be interested in STEM careers than boys are, especially for fields that are math-intensive such as physics and engineering. This lack of interest has been connected to a narrow and often inaccurate view of the engineering profession and the perceived misalignment between what engineers do and what girls value in future careers. Informal learning environments can play a pivotal role in inspiring today’s youth to pursue careers in STEM. These contexts have been shown to be powerful and transformative settings in which young people can begin to cultivate lifelong interest in –and understanding of – a broad range of STEM topics. Moreover, informal learning environments often allow for parents and children to collaboratively engage in STEM learning, which may be particularly important in fields like engineering where parents have been shown to play a critical role in career choice. The purpose of the Gender Research on Adult-child Discussions within Informal ENgineering environmenTs (GRADIENT) study is to explore gender differences in the development of early engineering interest and understanding. In particular, the project closely examines parent-child conversation within a range of informal engineering contexts that exist at the intersection of parents, children, and meaningful STEM learning. In this study we examine a pre-school program where parents and children can play with engineering-focused toys, a family-oriented engineering event for elementary students and their parents, and an engineering exhibit within a science museum. This paper focuses on the first setting, the pre-school program where parents and children play with toys to engage in engineering-related activities. Drawing from the literature on both engineering education and informal science education, video-recordings from 30 daughter-parent dyads are analyzed for informal engineering learning in two ways. First, we investigate the parent-child discussions that occur during engineering activity using the lens of Islands of Expertise, a theory developed by Crowley and Jacobs (2002) that suggests short instances of explanatory talk between parents and children within informal environments can form lasting linkages between interest and understanding over time. Second, we investigate specific engineering behaviours exhibited by the parent-child dyads. Preliminary findings suggest that both parents and children re-frame the design task that is given to them to add more context to the task. Iteration varies widely across the parent-child dyads, and examples of optimization also vary across the parent-child dyads. These findings provide insights into how what engineering thinking might look like for young children (aged 4-6 years) as well as insights into the types of engineering-related activities that may be engaging for young girls.",,2013,34,16,0,True,,244,2080702491,C.

What is most interesting is that the results of the study also describe how Malay society still maintains the traits of societal life that emphasize on harmony even in communication.

247,Environmental Influences on Mate Preferences as Assessed by a Scenario Manipulation Experiment,"Many evolutionary psychology studies have addressed the topic of mate preferences, focusing particularly on gender and cultural differences. However, the extent to which situational and environmental variables might affect mate preferences has been comparatively neglected. We tested 288 participants in order to investigate the perceived relative importance of six traits of an ideal partner (wealth, dominance, intelligence, height, kindness, attractiveness) under four different hypothetical scenarios (status quo/nowadays, violence/post-nuclear, poverty/resource exhaustion, prosperity/global well-being). An equal number of participants (36 women, 36 men) was allotted to each scenario; each was asked to allocate 120 points across the six traits according to their perceived value. Overall, intelligence was the trait to which participants assigned most importance, followed by kindness and attractiveness, and then by wealth, dominance and height. Men appraised attractiveness as more valuable than women. Scenario strongly influenced the relative importance attributed to traits, the main finding being that wealth and dominance were more valued in the poverty and post-nuclear scenarios, respectively, compared to the other scenarios. Scenario manipulation generally had similar effects in both sexes, but women appeared particularly prone to trade off other traits for dominance in the violence scenario, and men particularly prone to trade off other traits for wealth in the poverty scenario. Our results are in line with other correlational studies of situational variables and mate preferences, and represent strong evidence of a causal relationship of environmental factors on specific mate preferences, corroborating the notion of an evolved plasticity to current ecological conditions. A control experiment seems to suggest that our scenarios can be considered as realistic descriptions of the intended ecological conditions.",PLoS ONE,2013,81,11,0,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'There is strong evidence of a causal relationship of environmental factors on specific mate preferences, corroborating the notion of an evolved plasticity to current ecological conditions and a control experiment seems to suggest that the scenarios can be considered as realistic descriptions of the intended ecological conditions.'}",248,31495970,R.

The present work introduced a new experimental paradigm to test some of those assumptions by studying the impact of sexual objectification in a simulated job interview on performance, sexual harassment judgments, and emotions for women who experienced (akin to complainants), observed (akin to coworkers or witnesses), or predicted (akin to investigators, EEOC officers, mediators, jurors, or judges,) the impact of sexual objectification. Consistent with hypotheses, sexual objectification resulted in worse performance predictions, more sexual harassment, and more negative emotion compared with the control condition, but these effects were moderated by perspective. Overall, predictors estimated worse performance, more sexual harassment, and more negative emotion in response to sexual objectification than observers and experiencers. Anticipated negative emotion and self-referencing explained the effects for predictors. Theoretical and practical implications for legal and psychological theory on sexual harassment, objectification, and affective forecasting are discussed.",,2013,70,33,1,False,,249,50133164,A.

250,Participant sexual orientation matters: new evidence on the gender bias in face recognition.,"Research participants' sexual orientation is not consistently taken into account in experimental psychological research. We argue that it should be in any research related to participant or target gender. Corroborating this argument, an example study is presented on the gender bias in face recognition, the finding that women correctly recognize more female than male faces. In contrast, findings with male participants have been inconclusive. An online experiment (N = 1,147) was carried out, on purpose over-sampling lesbian and gay participants. Findings demonstrate that the pro-female gender bias in face recognition is modified by male participants' sexual orientation. Heterosexual women and lesbians as well as heterosexual men showed a pro-female gender bias in face recognition, whereas gay men showed a pro-male gender bias, consistent with the explanation that differences in face expertise develop congruent with interests. These results contribute to the growing evidence that participant sexual orientation can be used to distinguish between alternative theoretical explanations of given gender-correlated patterns of findings.",Experimental Psychology,2013,45,18,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Findings demonstrate that the pro-female gender bias in face recognition is modified by male participants' sexual orientation, and contribute to the growing evidence that participant sexual orientation can be used to distinguish between alternative theoretical explanations of given gender-correlated patterns of findings.""}",251,1412068766,Marianne Tønnessen,2106253611,Vebjørn Aalandslid,4958459,T.

253,"Decomposition of the gender wage gap in Portugal, 1998–2007: The evidence of gender discrimination","The purpose of this article is to analyse the gender wage gap in Portugal by applyingthe counterfactual decomposition method employed by Machado and Mata (2005).In order to obtain a measure for wage discrimination at different quantiles, wagefunction estimation is based on quantile regression analysis (Koenker and Basset 1978), using datasets from the Inquerito ao Emprego (IELFS – Portuguese LabourForce Survey) of 1998 and 2007. The decomposition of gender wage inequalityshows potential wage discrimination by gender due to the differences in the returnsof working men’s and women’s characteristics. This discrimination increases acrossthe whole distribution, for both 1998 and 2007. Although differences in the workingmen’s and women’s characteristics declined, the results show empirical evidence ofthe persistence of the discrimination effect in 2007 – at the same level. In addition, Oaxaca-Blinder’s standard decomposition approach, developed in 1973, was applied.The results confirm the average gender wage gap does not reflect the reality observedthroughout the wage distribution, inasmuch as it overestimates what happens in lower-level quantiles and underestimates those of the higher levels.",,2013,0,4,0,False,,254,2462012,J.

254,Whence Feminism? Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary Archives,"This essay is a meditation on the possibility of a feminist assessment of digital literary archives and the interdisciplinary tools needed to do such work. Using the Women Writers Project and The Orlando Project as exemplary instances of digital literary scholarship, I discuss possible sites of feminist intervention (content, technological politics, labor structures,etc) and the kinds of theoretical paradigms one might use in such work. I also argue that such assessments are essential to recognizing the ways in which feminist digital literary studies have impacted the field of digital humanities. Drawing on recent work in technology studies and feminist theory, the essay problematizes simplistic celebratory claims and troubles the idea that simply saving women’s work in digital form is enough. I conclude with a set of reflections on the impact of shifting ideas about the value of feminist work and theory in both public and scholarly contexts. This includes a proposal that more established scholars proactively highlight the feminist interventions that they make and that all digital literary scholars consider increasing access to not only the work of women, but to the technologies that are integral to that access as well. In 2011, I presented a paper titled “Encoding Women: Are Digital Archives Feminist?” at the Renaissance Society of American conference in Montreal. Among other things, I argued for a recollection of the feminist effects of many digital humanities methodologies — including the much-lauded cooperative or collaborative project. One of the audience members asked me why we should consider such practices to be distinctly feminist, as opposed to part of a “more general liberatory” ethic that derives as much from the civil rights movement and cultural studies as anything else. I was troubled by the question, but not entirely sure why. I have come to see that his question supposes that digital tools and methods can be either (narrowly) feminist or “more generally liberatory,” but not both. It also suggests that the ethical and political agendas of feminisms cannot encompass concerns with race, class, or sexuality — something that runs completely counter to the work of most third-wave feminists and theories of intersectionality. Finally, by suggesting that I had to write a history that was either feminist or “more general,” his question encouraged a dangerous kind of appropriation, one that incorporates many of the insights and practices of various feminisms but strips out their identification as such, thereby eliding the many ways in which feminists and feminist paradigms have effected change. This growing invisibility is something with which I have grown increasingly concerned, as it seems to me that the salutary work of feminist scholarship has been systematically subsumed under some other — any other — banner. Not only does this make the work of scholarly feminism invisible, once again writing women out of history, it also creates a vision of 21st-century feminism as what is left over, what has not been claimed by other now mainstream methodologies, merely the hysterical rantings of angry women (again). Over the course of a couple of years now, I’ve worked to find a methodology that would allow me to answer the question that motivated that 2011 paper — can we describe digital archives as feminist? — and have consistently run into problems. Where should I look to find evidence of feminist engagement when considering digital archives? What metrics should be applied to measure the degree of feminism embodied by a digital archive, and what is the subject of that measurement? Are digital archives feminist because the content is by women, or because the modes of production are feminist, or because the technologies themselves are feminist or used to feminist ends? Is it all three? Do we have to 4 3 account for both the historical and social contexts from which particular archives arise when thinking about the nature of their feminism? What tools might be helpful in thinking through the sense that tools like XML are neutral? These are important questions not only because the answers enable a feminist critique of what have become cornerstones of digital humanities and literary work — digital archives — but also because the answers may help clarify the nature of the impact of feminism on digital humanities work. Within literary studies of the past, the major locus of feminist intervention was a text or set of texts, initially in the text “itself” and then also in its materiality and historical context. Such work provides models for thinking through text technologies, social conditions of reading and writing in print media, and rhetorical analysis, but not for working with digital media or with the large archive. Scholarship on brick and mortar archives offers models for thinking through collection building practices, information management, and certain kinds of access. To find models for assessing the hardware, software, and usage practices that are central to digital literary archives I had to turn to work within Science and Technology Studies, Media Studies, and feminist theorists of technology. This is the future of digital literary studies work — a complicated but necessary traversal of multiple disciplinary zones. Work in the history of the book has reminded literary scholars that we cannot ignore the social and material history of a text, an insight no less true when those texts are digital. Rather than answer the question that launched me on this project, what I’ll be doing here is attempting to sketch out the possible methodological terrain — answering not “are these digital archives feminist?” but “how might we understand the feminisms of digital literary archives?” Much of this essay can speak to issues around digital archives generally, but my focus is particularly on literary archives and implications for literary studies. There is a historical reason for this — both Orlando and WWO arose out of needs articulated by literary scholars for access to the work of women writers and to their histories. They were imagined as critical interventions in the way literature is taught and studied, and, indeed, many scholars and students use these and other digital archives as their primary sources for women’s writing. Thus, to understand the feminisms of digital literary archives is to understand how feminist theory and digital practices are critical contexts for literary scholarship, whether digital or analog, in the 21st century.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,2013,48,38,1,False,,255,33524004,P.

255,HOW PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE IMPEDES INTERSECTIONAL THINKING1,"Abstract Psychological science that examines racial and gender bias, primarily located within social psychology, has tended to discount the ways in which race and gender mutually construct each other. Lay conceptions of racial and gender discrimination tend to see racism as primarily afflicting men and sexism primarily afflicting White women, when in fact race and gender are interrelated and work together intersectionally. Ignoring women's experiences of racial discrimination produces androcentric conceptions of racisms—in other words, many definitions of racial discrimination are to some degree sexist (Goff et al., 2008). Similarly, privileging the experiences of White women produces narrow definitions of gender discrimination—in other words, many definitions of gender discrimination are to some degree racist, such that they serve to reinforce the current societal hierarchies. Psychological science sometimes appears to reflect such conceptions. The result is that the social science principally responsible for explaining individual-level biases has developed a body of research that can undervalue the experiences of non-White women (Goff et al., 2008). This article examines features of social psychological science and its research processes to answer a question suggested by this framing: is the current psychological understanding of racism, to some extent, sexist and the understanding of sexism, to some extent, racist? We argue here that the instruments that much of social psychological science uses to measure racial and gender discrimination may play a role in producing inaccurate understandings of racial and gender discrimination. We also present original experimental data to suggest that lay conceptions parallel social psychology's biases: with lay persons also assuming that racism is about Black men and sexism is about White women.2 Finally, we provide some suggestions to increase the inclusivity of psychology's study of discrimination as well as reasons for optimism in this area.",Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race,2013,117,56,8,False,,256,66425420,Irina Lazarevich,2100111223,M.

256,Violencia en el noviazgo y salud mental en estudiantes universitarios mexicanos,"Antecedentes: En las últimas dos décadas, ha aumentado el interés por la promoción de la salud en el sector educativo superior, a través del programa “Universidades Saludables” promovido por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS). Es importante reconocer las necesidades relacionadas con la salud de los integrantes de la comunidad universitaria, así como reflexionar sobre las acciones dirigidas a cubrirlas. Uno de los problemas prioritarios respecto a la salud mental de los jóvenes universitarios es la violencia en el noviazgo. Considerando lo anterior, los objetivos del presente estudio fueron: evaluar la violencia en el noviazgo, la sintomatología depresiva y la autoestima en estudiantes universitarios; estudiar la relación entre la violencia, la depresión y la autoestima; y promover la implementación de programas preventivos entre la comunidad universitaria. Métodos: Se realizó un estudio transversal y descriptivo con las respuestas de 729 estudiantes universitarios, aplicando el “Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationship Inventory,” el Inventario de Depresión de Beck y el Inventario de Coopersmith para evaluar la autoestima. Resultados: Los resultados mostraron una elevada prevalencia de violencia en los jóvenes universitarios, particularmente verbal-emocional (75%). Las agresiones fueron de carácter bidireccional, tanto hombres como mujeres cometieron y sufrieron la violencia. La conducta violenta se asoció con la baja autoestima en las mujeres y con síntomas depresivos en ambos sexos. Conclusiones: Desde el enfoque del programa “Universidades Saludables,” es importante que las instituciones de educación superior sean promotoras de la salud mediante la creación y difusión del conocimiento, la formación de recursos humanos y la promoción de la organización comunitaria.

260,“Of Course There Are Werewolves and Vampires”: True Blood and the Right to Rights for Other Species,"Often dismissed as superficial, vampire films and television series have been a dominant mode by which Hollywood has negotiated the ever-shifting contours of social difference in the United States since the 1920s and 1930s. Remarkably, critical analysis has paid little attention to the interconnections between racism, sexism, and speciesism—and almost no attention to ways that difference affects nonhuman animals. Drawing on work in animal studies and the posthumanities, this article explores the extent to which HBO’s True Blood (2008–present) can contribute to the ongoing process of decolonizing thinking from the everyday habits defined by anthropocentrism. By featuring supernatural species, it questions unwitting complicity with forms of cinematic and televisual realism in reifying political realism. The series is premised on the political organization of vampires who advocate for the right to the right of citizenship, exploring ongoing asymmetries in social and political power through resurrected Confederate soldiers, ghosts of murdered women and children, and terrorism in the form of rebel vampire groups exploding the factories where synthetic blood is manufactured and multiracial hate-groups of male and female humans wearing rubber “Barack Obama” masks and murdering shapeshifters. If the animal turn follows the postcolonial turn, then this article asks whether True Blood might suggest ways for humans to live ethically with other species and to think interspecies relations in ways that consider what interspecies ethics might also mean to humans still defined in terms of race, sex, nativity, and religion.",,2013,44,11,0,False,,261,83097766,Á.

We tested the relative efficacy of reducing concerns related to each of the stereotypes in a field experiment in which female confederates who sometimes wore pregnancy prostheses applied for jobs in a retail setting. As expected, ratings from 3 perspectives (applicants, observers, and independent coders) converged to show that pregnant applicants received more interpersonal hostility than did nonpregnant applicants. However, when hiring managers received (vs. did not receive) counterstereotypic information about certain pregnancy-related stereotypes (particularly lack of commitment and inflexibility), managers displayed significantly less interpersonal discrimination.

However, no study has yet investigated how sexual harassment is related to fundamental beliefs in Benin or West African countries. We conducted a field study on 265 female and male students from several high schools in Benin to investigate the link between sexual harassment and measures of ambivalent sexism, gender identity, and rape myth acceptance. Almost half of the sample reported having experienced sexual harassment personally or among peers. Levels of sexism and rape myth acceptance were very high compared to other studies. These attitudes appeared to converge in a sexist belief system that was linked to personal experiences, the perceived probability of experiencing and fear of sexual harassment. Results suggest that sexual harassment is a societal problem and that interventions need to address fundamental attitudes held in societies low in gender equality.",,2013,66,4,0,False,,274,69405544,Heiko Motschenbacher,,,,,,,,,,,History,JournalArticle

280,Rape myths: is elite opinion right and popular opinion wrong?,"England and Wales have recently experienced wide-ranging rape law reform and a galloping rape reporting rate but no comparable increase in rape convictions, leading many erstwhile law reformers to turn attention to attitudes. In essence, their argument is that reform has proved relatively ineffective because a range of agents hold ‘rape myths’. Despite the broad consensus that this approach has attracted, I argue that the regressiveness of current public attitudes towards rape has been overstated. The claim that rape myths are widespread may be challenged on three grounds: first, some of the attitudes are not myths; secondly, not all the myths are about rape; thirdly, there is little evidence that the rape myths are widespread. To a troubling extent, we are in the process of creating myths about myths. This process functions to close down, not open up, the possibilities of a productive public conversation about important and at times vexed questions.",,2013,0,37,2,False,,281,4147858,S.

In three experiments, women liked gender egalitarian men more so than men did, but both genders stigmatized them as more feminine, weak, and likely to be gay, compared with control male targets. This was true even when the gender egalitarian was an actual presidential candidate for the American Psychological Association (Experiment 3). We examined whether stigmatization was due to (a) gender egalitarians’ presumed affiliations with women and/or gay men (stigma-by-association); (b) the gay male feminist stereotype; or (c) a threat to men’s gender identity. Results supported stigma-by-association, but only for affiliations with women (not gay men). The gay male feminist stereotype was robust, but did not account for stigmatization, and men’s reactions to male gender egalitarians were independent of their gender identity.

Given that there has been no global investigation of the factors that might impede their successful use in cases of sexual assault, we conducted a review of relevant scholarly and “grey” literature from industrialized and less-developed regions. One key theme to emerge from the analysis concerned certain problematic practices and behaviors of professional groups involved in the various stages of the post-sexual assault process. We found that a lack of competence in handling sexual assault cases, contempt for women who have been victimized, and corruption among some forensic examiners, police, scientists, and legal personnel often have shaped the collection, processing, analysis, and use of medico-legal evidence.

286,Un-Ringing the Bell: Mcgowan on Oppressive Speech and The Asymmetric Pliability of Conversations,"In recent work Mary Kate McGowan presents an account of oppressive speech inspired by David Lewis's analysis of conversational kinematics. Speech can effect identity-based oppression, she argues, by altering ‘the conversational score’—which is to say, roughly, that it can introduce presuppositions and expectations into a conversation, and thus determine what sort of subsequent conversational ‘moves’ are apt, correct, felicitous, etc.—in a manner that oppresses members of a certain group (e.g. because the suppositions and expectations derogate or demean members of that group). In keeping with the Lewisian picture, McGowan stresses the asymmetric pliability of conversational scores. She argues that it is easier to introduce (for example) sexist presuppositions and expectations into a conversation than it is to remove them. Responding to a sexist remark, she thus suggests, is like trying to ‘unring a bell’. I begin by situating McGowan's work in the wider literature on speech and social hierarchy, and explaining how her account of oppressive speech improves upon the work of others in its explication of the relationship between individuals' verbal conduct and structurally oppressive social arrangements. I then propose an explanation and supportive elaboration of McGowan's claims about the asymmetric pliability of conversations involving identity-oppressive speech. Rather than regarding such asymmetry as a sui generis phenomenon, I show how we can understand it as a consequence of a more general asymmetry between making things salient and un-salient in speech, and I show how this asymmetry also operates in various cases that interested Lewis.",,2013,55,37,0,True,,287,114303822,C.

Yet, it is unclear how this motivation develops. The current work tested one route through which feelings of acceptance from outgroup members facilitate the development of IMS. Longitudinally, feeling accepted by outgroup members predicted increases in IMS across a 15-week period (Study 1). Experimental manipulations of outgroup acceptance also increased IMS toward racial outgroups (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, IMS mediated the relationship between outgroup acceptance and participants' increased willingness to pay money to increase opportunities for interracial contact (Study 2). Tests of mediation also demonstrated that feelings of acceptance mediated the effect of outgroup acceptance on internal motivation (Study 3). In addition, this pattern of responses held for members of both high- and low-status racial groups.

Studies 1-3 establish and replicate the basic effect, and rule out alternative explanations (positivity, projection, status striving) for men's tendency to dichotomize more than women. Studies 4 and 5 demonstrate the motivated nature of gender dichotomization by establishing that men, but not women, dichotomize more strenuously when reminded of the precariousness of their gender status, and report stronger motivation to restore their gender status upon learning that their ingroup is becoming less dichotomized.

Touch in such films is figured in diverse ways ranging from pats of reassurance and hugs of congratulation to cuffs of disapprobation. Touch is also occasionally depicted differently, dependent upon the ethnicity and gender of the central characters in specific films. These distinctions are evaluated for what they reveal about the nuances of understandings of touch in film portrayals of sport education in American high schools. The difficulty of interpreting physical contact between coaches and athletes in these films, and what this reveals about the problem of policing touch in general in educational settings, is explored. Finally, the paper examines how the films expose the intricacy of tactile encounters in ways that challenge the judiciousness of risk-averse ‘no-touch’ policies and practices in sports coaching.",,2013,33,4,0,False,,293,4263440,J.

293,"Impact of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support on Filipino immigrant worker mental health and substance use.","BACKGROUND
The personal and social impact of mental health problems and substance use on workforce participation is costly. Social determinants of health contribute significantly to health disparities beyond effects associated with work. Guided by a theory-driven model, we identified pathways by which social determinants shape immigrant worker health.


METHOD
Associations between known social determinants of mental health problems and substance use (social discrimination, job and employment concerns, and social support) were examined using structural equation modeling in a sample of 1,397 immigrants from the Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study.


RESULTS
Social discrimination and low social support were associated with mental health problems and substance use (P < 0.05). Job and employment concerns were associated with mental health problems, but not substance use.

297,The Origins of Senegalese Homophobia: Discourses on Homosexuals and Transgender People in Colonial and Postcolonial Senegal,"Abstract: This article traces the history of homosexual and transgender behavior in Senegal from colonial times to the contemporary period in order to demonstrate the flimsiness of the claims, made by many political and religious leaders and scholars, that homosexuality is “un-African.” Such claims, which appear as reactions to neocolonialism and Western intervention in African affairs, usually are homophobic discourses that invoke patriotism, cultural difference, and morality in order to justify the subjugation of homosexual and gender nonconforming individuals (goor-jiggens) living in Senegal. In an attempt to understand the roots of Senegalese homophobia, the article analyzes several depictions of homosexuals and transgender people in contemporary Senegal and traces them to similar representations in European writings of the colonial period. As this approach reveals, homosexuals and transgender people in Senegal, from colonial times to the present, have been constructed as scapegoats, first of the French mission civilisatrice (civilizing mission) and then of Senegalese political and Islamic backlashes. Although they have always cohabited with the rest of the society, homosexuals and transgender people in Senegal have been treated largely as strangers in their own land. By analyzing the discourses of both French colonials and Senegalese, one finds a persistent binary opposing the West and Africa and denigrating sexual and gender variances and subcultures in Senegal as pathological European imports. Résumé: Cet article retrace l’évolution historique des comportements homosexuels et transsexuels au Sénégal depuis les temps coloniaux jusqu’à aujourd’hui dans le but de démontrer la faiblesse des revendications faites par de nombreux leaders et intellectuels que “l’homosexualité n’est pas africaine.” De telles déclarations, apparemment des réactions contre le néocolonialisme et l’intervention des pays occidentaux dans les affaires africaines, sont pour la plupart des discours homophobes qui font appel au patriotisme, aux différences culturelles, et à des valeurs morales bien-pensantes pour justifier l’assujettissement des homosexuels et ceux ne se conformant pas aux normes sexuelles actuelles (goor-jiggens) au Sénégal. Dans un effort de comprendre les racines de l’homophobie présente au Sénégal, cet article analyse plusieurs représentations d’homosexuels et de transsexuels dans le Sénégal d’aujourd’hui et les relie à des représentations similaires dans la littérature européenne pendant l’époque coloniale. Cette approche montre que les homosexuels et transsexuels au Sénégal ont été, depuis les temps coloniaux, construits comme des boucs émissaires, tout d’abord de la “mission civilisatrice” française et ensuite des protestations contre les islamistes et le gouvernement sénégalais. Bien qu’ils aient toujours cohabité avec le reste de la société, les homosexuels et transsexuels ont été traités largement comme des étrangers dans leur propre pays. En analysant les discours des colons français et des Sénégalais, on trouve une polarisation opposant l’occident a l’Afrique et caractérisant négativement les variances de genre et de sexualité ainsi que les cultures marginales au Sénégal comme des phénomènes importés d’Europe.",African Studies Review,2013,64,34,4,False,,298,3659909,A.

301,Racial Identity Buffers African American Women From Body Image Problems and Disordered Eating,"The purpose of our study was to extend tenets of objectification theory to a sample of 278 undergraduate African American women. We hypothesized that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes would moderate the relationship between sexually objectifying experiences and internalized sociocultural standards of beauty, which would then correlate with less body surveillance. In turn, we predicted that less body surveillance would be associated with less body shame, appearance anxiety, and greater interoceptive awareness, which would likely be associated with decreased eating disordered behaviors. A moderated mediation analysis supported the overall model, suggesting that internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes buffer against sexually objectifying experiences. When sexually objectifying experiences were high and internalized multiculturally inclusive racial identity attitudes were low, participants were more likely to internalize dominant standards of beauty, which was then associated with increased body surveillance, body shame, appearance anxiety, disordered eating, and poorer interoceptive awareness.

302,The Influence of Female Role Models on Women’s Implicit Science Cognitions,"Can female science professors benefit women? Women’s negative implicit cognitions about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines impact performance in these fields, marking implicit associations as a space for potential change to improve women’s participation in STEM. Examining college student science majors (N = 320, 63% women) enrolled in chemistry and engineering courses, our study investigates how meaningful contact with female role models impacts women’s implicit cognitions about STEM. We used the Implicit Association Test to measure attitudes toward science, identification with science, and gendered stereotypes about science, and we compared students with female versus male professors. Our study first demonstrates both direct and indirect paths between implicit cognitions and women’s career aspirations in STEM. Next, when female professors were seen as positive role models, women automatically identified with science and stereotyped science as more feminine than masculine. Moreover, viewing professors as positive role models was associated with pro-science career aspirations and attitudes (both implicit and explicit), for men and women alike. The findings suggest that female science professors benefit women provided students identify with them as role models. We conclude that female STEM professors not only provide positive role models for women, but they also help to reduce the implicit stereotype that science is masculine in the culture-at-large. We further discuss how shifting implicit gendered stereotypes about science can impact women’s investment in a science career.",,2013,49,164,5,False,,303,72978277,J. Wiest,143637980,M.

308,A Warm Farewell.,"A dozen years ago, not long after the founding of the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), leaders of the organization recognized the need for a dedicated journal for the society. They sought a place in print that we molecular diagnosticians could call our own and where we could publish advances in a field that bridged basic science and clinical diagnostics. The initial goals were simple: to give equal value to new technology and new discoveries, to provide careful validation and comparison of clinical assays, and to promote our growing expertise, as well as that of this fledgling organization, AMP. These leaders also saw the value in partnering with a larger, established professional group that could aid us in quickly reaching beyond the borders of molecular pathology to a broader range of pathology and medical professionals. Thus, in 1999, The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics was launched (originally as The American Journal of Pathology, Part B), in collaboration with the American Society for Investigative Pathology. It has been a tremendous honor to spend 11 years serving in a leadership role for the JMD, and this issue will sadly be my last as Editor-in-Chief. It is my belief that the JMD has fulfilled those early goals, and my greatest desire is that it will continue to thrive well into the future. 
 
It has been exciting and rewarding to watch the Journal grow, along with AMP itself. Early on, AMP meetings served as a focal point for bringing together those few of us practicing molecular diagnostics (Who else could relate to the highs and lows of defining quality control and assay reproducibility when dealing with radiolabeled probes?). Over the years, the field has become much more sophisticated in its technology, clinical applications, and assay standardization, and the articles published within the JMD reflect this evolution. AMP has also become active nationally and internationally, addressing a variety of regulatory, educational, and other issues, and in parallel, the JMD has seen an increasing number of position papers from the society and other professional groups addressing many of the same issues of importance to our colleagues and trainees (see the Special Report on competency-based education in this issue). We are also at the point where an increasing number of submitted manuscripts no longer fit squarely into the traditional subdivisions of our society (Solid Tumors, Hematopathology, Genetics, and Infectious Disease) but instead fall into new areas, which will require ongoing evolution on the part of the JMD. Molecular diagnostics has grown in amazing and unanticipated directions and will continue to do so in the years to come, as will the JMD. 
 
I am very proud to see the progress that has been made by the JMD. Submissions have risen again this past year, and the quality of papers continues to go up. We have successfully moved from a quarterly to bimonthly publication, without a drop in quality or number of articles per issue. We continue to attract an increasing number of timely Reviews, as well as Commentaries on key articles, published within each issue. And perhaps the most quantitative, and scrutinized, measure of our success, the impact factor, has risen to an outstanding 3.643 (2008 JCR). The JMD has clearly established itself as the premier journal in the field of molecular diagnostics. Again, changes lie ahead, as we anticipate the revolution in scientific publishing that is coming: electronic and publish-ahead-of-print article delivery are just the beginning—I expect to have JMD content available instantaneously in my pocket in the not-so-distant future. Despite the many differences the future will bring to scientific publishing, the central purpose will remain unchanged: journals have a responsibility to provide efficient, unbiased peer review of scientific work, to relay top-quality, novel results to readers as quickly as possible, and to share useful information to advance the field as a whole. 
 
Thinking back, I am amazed by the responsibility and trust bestowed on me—by the Joint Journal Oversight Committee, the two societies, and their members, and by the innumerable authors who have entrusted our editorial team of Associate Editors and Editorial Board members with the task of evaluating their hard work. I hope we have handled each manuscript as we would our own, with fairness and a great deal of personal attention. We have strived to be open and unbiased, while maintaining and even raising the quality of published manuscripts. Occasionally issues did arise, and I hope that we handled these fairly and kindly—it is not easy to deliver negative news to one's respected colleagues. But this difficult job was made easier by the professionalism and grace shown by authors with whom we worked. The past years have been extremely gratifying, and I have learned and grown far more in knowledge and experience than I had ever imagined. While the JMD was envisioned to be a benefit to AMP, its members, and practitioners of molecular diagnostics worldwide, I truly feel as though the primary beneficiary has been me. 
 
As I say goodbye to my editorial responsibilities, my deepest thanks go out to all who have worked with me during my tenure. In particular, Nelson Fausto, who served as the first JMD Editor-in-Chief, guided me as I learned the ropes of editorial leadership as Senior Associate Editor. I thank the many Associate Editors who toiled tirelessly with me to oversee the review process and assist in manuscript decision making. I am also grateful to the three Managing Editors who have directed the JMD through its evolution: Priscilla Markwood, Maria Giorla, and Audra Cox. Finally, I am very appreciative of the leadership of the two societies for allowing me the editorial freedom to take the JMD in exciting directions. 
 
It is now time for a new leader to steer the direction of the JMD. So I extend my most enthusiastic wishes to Timothy O'Leary in his endeavors with the JMD; his leadership skills and strong molecular background make him an excellent choice to pilot the JMD into the future—a future that is very bright indeed. And although I will no longer be behind the helm, I will still read it cover to cover for years to come!",,2009,0,1,0,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This issue will sadly be my last as Editor-in-Chief of The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, and the central purpose will remain unchanged: journals have a responsibility to provide efficient, unbiased peer review of scientific work, to relay top-quality, novel results to readers as quickly as possible, and to share useful information to advance the field as a whole.'}",309,2490964,Martin Kolk,2628097,Sebastian Schnettler,,,,,,,,,"Sociology, Medicine","JournalArticle, Study"

310,"Subliminal Culture, Sexism and Hidden Curriculum in the Internationally Distributed Interchange Textbooks","This study sought to explore the culture, hidden curriculum and ideological import of the internationally distributed Interchange textbooks. It was intended to find out whether a recurrent ideological pattern and violation of the ethical standards of particular societies could be observed. To this end, the theory and procedures of critical discourse analysis (CDA), as expounded by Fairclough (1989), were applied to conversations, reading passages and illustrations in these textbooks and three dimensions of meaning - the social relations, their subject positions, and the content of the texts - were categorized and statistically analyzed. It was also an attempt to examine the status of sexism in the Interchange textbooks. To do so, two types of analysis were performed to examine the manifestations of sexist attitudes and values in four textbooks. First, a systematic quantitative content analysis was carried out with reference to sex visibility and female/male topic presentation in conversations, reading passages, and illustrations. Secondly, a qualitative inquiry was made into sex-linked job possibilities, sex-based activity types, stereotyped sex roles, firstness, and masculine generic conception. In general, the findings revealed that the internationally distributed Interchange textbooks are culture-biased and tend to represent a particular discourse type, i.e. the discourse of western culture, lifestyle, economy and consumer society which imposes a western sanctioned view. Moreover, the analysis showed that family, as the key component in Islamic societies, is deemphasized in the Interchange series. Results also revealed that these textbooks turn to be sexist in terms of invisibility of men. This can be a step forward in material preparation to consider women as first-class citizens. Meanwhile, in Islamic countries, it can be considered as an instrumental look at women to make these books more attractive and popular. Interestingly, these books cannot be considered sexist in terms of stereotyping a particular sex.",,2013,37,5,0,False,,311,50232890,C. Waters,123013937,Mercy Wey,1683176464,Rita Times,1683089622,M.

311,Perception of Health Status and Participation in Present and Future Health Promotion Behaviors Among African-American Women,"SUMMARY African-American women have a twofold prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and stroke and nearly a threefold higher risk of overall mortality compared to Caucasian women. Many of these potentially preventable health conditions are related to lifestyle. The purpose of this small, cross-sectional, descriptive survey study was to describe the perceived health status, current health-promotion behaviors, and interest in participating in future health-promotion activities among African-American women. We then sought to determine if there was an association between perceived health status and current health-promotion behaviors, and between perceived health status and interest in participating in future health-promotion activities. We administered a modified version of the Behavioral Risk Factor Questionnaire (BRFQ) by mail or telephone to a convenience sample of 53 African-American women living in the San Francisco Bay area. In general, the fairly healthy women reported being physically inactive, eating primarily a low-fat diet, not smoking cigarettes or drinking, and coping fairly well with stress, but not eating the daily recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables. Findings revealed perceived health status was not associated with current health-promotion behaviors or interests in participating in future health-promotion activities. A majority of the women, however, were interested in participating in future health-promotion activities, such as a women's health program, nutrition improvement, and moderate physical activity, indicating potential opportunities for health-promotion interventions that engage African-American women in healthier lifestyles. To help an individual make a future change, such as one's health-promotion practices, health-promotion interventionists must understand the individual's present behavior in the context of that culture.",,2001,42,0,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Perceived health status was not associated with current health-promotion behaviors or interests in participating in future health- Promotion activities, but a majority of the women were interested inparticipating in futureHealth-prom promotion activities, such as a women's health program, nutrition improvement, and moderate physical activity, indicating potential opportunities to engage African-American women in healthier lifestyles.""}",312,5347269,I.

312,Reliable Sex and Strain Discrimination in the Mouse Vomeronasal Organ and Accessory Olfactory Bulb,"Animals modulate their courtship and territorial behaviors in response to olfactory cues produced by other animals. In rodents, detecting these cues is the primary role of the accessory olfactory system (AOS). We sought to systematically investigate the natural stimulus coding logic and robustness in neurons of the first two stages of accessory olfactory processing, the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). We show that firing rate responses of just a few well-chosen mouse VNO or AOB neurons can be used to reliably encode both sex and strain of other mice from cues contained in urine. Additionally, we show that this population code can generalize to new concentrations of stimuli and appears to represent stimulus identity in terms of diverging paths in coding space. Together, the results indicate that firing rate code on the temporal order of seconds is sufficient for accurate classification of pheromonal patterns at different concentrations and may be used by AOS neural circuitry to discriminate among naturally occurring urine stimuli.",Journal of Neuroscience,2013,39,33,1,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results indicate that firing rate code on the temporal order of seconds is sufficient for accurate classification of pheromonal patterns at different concentrations and may be used by AOS neural circuitry to discriminate among naturally occurring urine stimuli.'}",313,51032023,C.

313,Non-binary or genderqueer genders,"Abstract Some people have a gender which is neither male nor female and may identify as both male and female at one time, as different genders at different times, as no gender at all, or dispute the very idea of only two genders. The umbrella terms for such genders are ‘genderqueer’ or ‘non-binary’ genders. Such gender identities outside of the binary of female and male are increasingly being recognized in legal, medical and psychological systems and diagnostic classifications in line with the emerging presence and advocacy of these groups of people. Population-based studies show a small percentage – but a sizable proportion in terms of raw numbers – of people who identify as non-binary. While such genders have been extant historically and globally, they remain marginalized, and as such – while not being disorders or pathological in themselves – people with such genders remain at risk of victimization and of minority or marginalization stress as a result of discrimination. This paper therefore reviews the limited literature on this field and considers ways in which (mental) health professionals may assist the people with genderqueer and non-binary gender identities and/or expressions they may see in their practice. Treatment options and associated risks are discussed.",International Review of Psychiatry,2016,61,469,33,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This paper considers ways in which (mental) health professionals may assist the people with genderqueer and non-binary gender identities and/or expressions they may see in their practice and considers treatment options and associated risks.'}",314,7534818,Marie Gustafsson Sendén,1416561510,L.

314,What makes physicians go to work while sick: a comparative study of sickness presenteeism in four European countries (HOUPE).,"QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY
Sickness presenteeism is common in the health sector, especially among physicians, leading to high costs in terms of medical errors and loss in productivity. This study investigates predictors of sickness presenteeism in university hospitals, which might be especially exposed to competitive presenteeism. The study included comparisons of university hospitals in four European countries.


METHODS
A cross-sectional survey analysis of factors related to sickness behaviour and work patterns in the field of academic medicine was performed among permanently employed physicians from the HOUPE (Health and Organisation among University Physicians Europe) study: (Sweden n = 1,031, Norway n= 354, Iceland n = 242, Italy n = 369). The outcome measure was sickness presenteeism.


RESULTS
Sickness presence was more common among Italian physicians (86%) compared with physicians in other countries (70%‑76%). Country-stratified analyses showed that sickness presenteeism was associated with sickness behaviour and role conflicts in all countries. Competition in the form of publishing articles was a predictor in Italy and Sweden. Organisational care for physician well-being reduced sickness presenteeism in all countries.


CONCLUSION
Sickness presenteeism in university hospitals is part of a larger behavioural pattern where physicians seem to neglect or hide their own illness. Factors associated with competitive climate and myths about a healthy doctor might contribute to these behaviours. Importantly, it is suggested that managers and organisations should work actively to address these questions since organisational care might reduce the extent of these behaviours.",Swiss medical weekly,2013,31,77,3,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Sickness presenteeism in university hospitals is part of a larger behavioural pattern where physicians seem to neglect or hide their own illness, and factors associated with competitive climate and myths about a healthy doctor might contribute to these behaviours.'}",315,116293438,Erin Whiteside,1448557232,J.

316,Understanding religion and social expectations in contemporary Muslim society when promoting breastfeeding,"The paper aims to examine religious and cultural issues with regards to breastfeeding and explore how this awareness can improve breastfeeding promotion in a contemporary Muslim society. Focusing specifically on Malay women, the study looks at how breastfeeding is being negotiated into women’s understanding of modesty in Islam and how this may affect the practice of breastfeeding in public. Using qualitative approach, nine focus groups were conducted among Malay mothers in different parts of Malaysia to explore their experiences breastfeeding in different locations. The respondents were also asked to comment on a breastfeeding picture taken from a local magazine to explore their level of acceptance and responses to image of breastfeeding in the media. It was observed that Malay women were very concerned about Islamic rules with regards to female modesty but often negotiated the sexualized breasts into their overall understanding. The combination of these concerns has discouraged many Malay women to breastfeed in public. The study also found that while many respondents are not comfortable with the idea of having images of Muslim breastfeeding women in the media, their concerns are all related to religious matters. The study suggests that images of Muslim women breastfeeding can and should be used in any promotional items in order to make it a culturally accepted behavior but must also adhere to Islamic rulings.",,2013,22,6,1,True,,317,6111719,Ž.

Additional aim was to compare the results with contemporary female population. Methods Five humerus measurements (maximum length, epicondylar width, maximum vertical diameter of the head, maximum and minimum diameter of the humerus at midshaft) for 80 male and 35 female medieval and 19 female contemporary humeri were recorded. Only sufficiently preserved skeletons and those with no obvious pathological or traumatic changes that could affect the measurements were included. For ten samples, analysis of DNA was performed in order to determine sex using amelogenin. Results The initial comparison of men and women indicated significant differences in all five measures (P < 0.001). Discriminant function for sex determination indicated that as much as 85% of cases could be properly categorized, with better results in men (86%) than women (80%). Furthermore, the comparison of the medieval and contemporary women did not show significant difference in any of the measured features. Sex results obtained by anthropological and DNA analysis matched in all 10 cases. Conclusion The results indicate that humerus measurement in Croatian medieval population may be sufficient to determine the sex of the skeleton.

318,Eastern Promise: Assessing the Future of UK-India Trade,"India is at a crossroads. As the UK Prime Minister prepares to meet Indian leaders virtually, he promises an Enhanced Trade Partnership, possibly leading to a full Free Trade Agreement (FTA). There are important commercial reasons for this agreement, but more importantly, there are powerful geopolitical reasons. India could be brought into an alignment of nations, including the CPTPP members, as a bulwark against the negative impact of China’s market distortions and security policies. The UK may just have the right combination of offensive and defensive flexibility to be able to do a deal with India. The contours of that deal are emerging and involve key UK asks, such as financial services and legal services access, as well as Scotch whisky tariff reduction, and key Indian asks, such as movement of natural persons supplying services and the UK committing not to impose bans on Indian agriculture in violation of the WTO SPS agreement. There is a developing alignment of nations, which collectively promote pro-competitive regulation where countries interact with each other through equivalence and mutual recognition as opposed to regulatory harmonisation. India has to choose whether to align with these nations or others, such as China, which have a very different model. There are strong geopolitical reasons for India to join this grouping – which could be started with an FTA with the UK – relating to its difficult relationship with China and its need to secure support in the Indian Ocean. However, a number of obstacles remain for this future to be reached. India has recently taken actions against the property rights of foreign investors. Property rights form the bedrock of economic systems that leverage the forces of competition to generate economic growth. But India’s market signals on property rights are negative and risk undermining its global reputation and potential. When the Prime Minister meets the Indian PM, he should make it clear that while the UK welcomes a deeper relationship with India, this will depend on whether India endorses, in both word and deed, property rights protection, market competition, and open trade.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2021,3,0,0,False,,319,114935582,G.

320,Stigma and intellectual disability: potential application of mental illness research.,"PURPOSE
Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) and individuals with mental illness are consistently found to be among the most socially excluded populations and continue to face substantial health, housing, and employment disparities due to stigma. Although this has spurred extensive research efforts and theoretical advancements in the study of stigma toward mental illness, the stigma of ID has received only limited attention. In this article we explore the application of mental illness stigma research for ID.


DESIGN
We carefully reviewed the existing research on mental illness stigma as a foundation for a parallel summary of the empirical literature on attitudes and stigma related to ID.


RESULTS
Based on our review, there has not been a systematic approach to the study of stigma toward ID. However, multilevel conceptual models of stigma have received much attention in the mental illness literature. These models have been used to inform targeted interventions and have application to the study of the stigma process for individuals with ID. Nonetheless, there are indeed key differences between-as well as substantial variability within-the ID and mental illness populations that must be considered.


CONCLUSIONS
Stigma is an issue of social justice impacting the lives of individuals with ID, yet there remains virtually no systematic framework applied to the understanding of the stigma process for this group. Future research can draw on the stigma models developed in the mental illness literature to guide more rigorous research efforts and ultimately the development of effective, multilevel stigma-change strategies for ID.",Rehabilitation Psychology,2013,150,89,7,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Stigma is an issue of social justice impacting the lives of individuals with ID, yet there remains virtually no systematic framework applied to the understanding of the stigma process for this group, prompting the development of effective, multilevel stigma-change strategies for ID.'}",321,145837406,J.

322,Charting a Moral Life: The Influence of Stigma and Filial Duties on Marital Decisions among Chinese Men who Have Sex with Men,"Introduction Stigma constitutes a critical challenge to the rising rates of HIV among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM). It reduces willingness to disclose one’s sexual orientation and can lead to concurrent sexual partnerships. Disclosure decisions are also affected by cultural norms that place pressures on sons to marry. In this manuscript, we characterize how stigma and cultural factors influenced Chinese MSM’s decisions around disclosure and marriage. We seek to show that MSM’s actions were motivated by moral considerations, even when those choices posed HIV transmission risks. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 MSM in Beijing, China. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English for analysis. Transcripts were coded using a procedure that allowed for themes to emerge organically. Results Participants struggled with feelings of shame and believed that others possessed stigmatizing attitudes about homosexuality. They had experienced relatively little discrimination because they infrequently disclosed their MSM status. In response to marital pressures, participant had to reconcile same-sex attractions with filial expectations. Their choices included: not being involved with women; putting on the appearance of a heterosexual relationship by marrying a lesbian; or fulfilling family expectations by marrying a heterosexual woman. Regardless of the decision, many rooted the justifications for their choices in the considerations they had given to others’ needs. Conclusion The growing epidemic among MSM in China requires action from the public health community. As programs are scaled up to serve these men, it is critical to remember that MSM, who often fear social sanction if they were to reveal their sexual orientation, continue to face the same pressures from culturally normative social duties as heterosexual men. Interventions must find ways to help men navigate a balance between their own needs and the responsibilities they feel toward their parents and others.",PLoS ONE,2013,32,77,7,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is sought to show that MSM’s actions were motivated by moral considerations, even when those choices posed HIV transmission risks, and that MSM continue to face the same pressures from culturally normative social duties as heterosexual men.'}",323,6414210,E.

323,The effects of single-sex compared with coeducational schooling on mathematics and science achievement: Data from Korea,"Some U.S. school districts are experimenting with single-sex schooling, hoping that it will yield better academic outcomes for students. Empirical research on the effects of single-sex schooling, however, has been equivocal, with various studies finding benefits, disadvantages, or no effect. Most of this research is marred because families generally choose whether the child attends a single-sex or coeducational school, so there are selection effects that create pre-existing differences between students in the different types of schools. The research reported here capitalized on the case of Korea, where students are randomly assigned to single-sex or coeducational schools. Using 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data, we applied hierarchical linear modeling to account for the nesting of students within schools. Results for eighth graders indicated no differences between students in single-sex and coeducational schools in mathematics and science achievement. Results from the 2003 TIMSS data replicated the finding: students' mathematics and science achievement was unrelated to the gender composition of their school.

324,Buffering attachment-related avoidance: softening emotional and behavioral defenses during conflict discussions.,"This study examined whether partners can soften the defenses associated with attachment-related avoidance. Heterosexual couples (N = 180) were video-recorded having 2 discussions in which 1 partner (the agent of influence) wanted the other partner (the target of influence) to change in some way. After rating how successful the discussion was in producing change, agents and targets reviewed their discussions. At the end of every 30 s of the interaction, they reported how angry they were during that portion of the discussion. For each 30-s interval, objective coders rated the extent to which targets of influence exhibited withdrawal and agents of influence (partners) softened their influence by being sensitive to targets' autonomy needs and by conveying that targets were valued. As predicted, avoidant targets showed greater anger and withdrawal when they were the target of their partner's influence, and these defensive reactions were associated with less successful discussions. However, analyzing within-person changes in emotions and behavior across the discussion revealed that avoidant targets' anger and withdrawal were attenuated at points during the discussion when their partners exhibited higher levels of softening communication. Between-person analyses comparing average levels of anger and partner softening across dyads also revealed that avoidant targets whose partners engaged in more softening experienced less anger and, in turn, couples' discussions were more successful. These results highlight the importance of dyadic processes in understanding the impact of attachment insecurity on relationships, and indicate that partners can buffer avoidant defenses by down-regulating anger and circumventing withdrawal during conflict discussions.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2013,75,113,4,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Between-person analyses comparing average levels of anger and partner softening across dyads revealed that avoidant targets whose partners engaged in more softening experienced less anger and, in turn, couples' discussions were more successful.""}",325,23691519,H.

An Investigation Using Japanese Employees,"The present study empirically examined previously inconsistent findings between Aldwin (Aldwin, C. M., 1994. Stress, coping, and development.

In particular, we examined whether stressor evaluation serves as a mediating factor in the relationship between sociocultural beliefs concerning coping and coping selection among a sample of Japanese employees (n 1,087). Results showed that although stressor evaluation significantly mediated the relationship between sociocultural beliefs concerning coping and coping selection, this mediating effect was small. These results did not support Aldwin’s model, but did support Slavin et al.’s model, suggesting that merely managing how individuals evaluate stressors might be insufficient for regulating the influence of sociocultural beliefs concerning coping on coping selection.",,2013,25,11,0,False,,326,2991629,Nathan P.

326,Are we really measuring what we say we're measuring? Using video techniques to supplement traditional construct validation procedures.,"Several researchers have persuasively argued that the most important evidence to consider when assessing construct validity is whether variations in the construct of interest cause corresponding variations in the measures of the focal construct. Unfortunately, the literature provides little practical guidance on how researchers can go about testing this. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe how researchers can use video techniques to test whether their scales measure what they purport to measure. First, we discuss how researchers can develop valid manipulations of the focal construct that they hope to measure. Next, we explain how to design a study to use this manipulation to test the validity of the scale. Finally, comparing and contrasting traditional and contemporary perspectives on validation, we discuss the advantages and limitations of video-based validation procedures.",Journal of Applied Psychology,2013,71,68,1,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'How researchers can use video techniques to test whether their scales measure what they purport to measure and the advantages and limitations of video-based validation procedures are described.'}",327,1870739,I.

Findings reveal three distinct career paths (research, teaching, and industry). This study provides insight into individual career decision processes involving as to how gender is experienced in male-centric cultures, how experiences of barriers are reframed, and how obstacles influence choices. These women emphasized strong desires to contribute to their respective fields and to collaborate with others, a key relational aspect missing in their current work. All participants indicated aspirations to have both a career and a full life beyond the lab. Findings further suggest a post-doctoral environment laden with gender and family biases including subtle discrimination and challenges specific to women working in male-centric cultures. A strong relationship between experiences of gender and family biases suggests that additional burdens are placed on women's career paths and their evolving identity. This study identifies the postdoctoral journey as a unique transition zone marked by a period of adaptation and selection as they make sense of their experience and decide on how best to achieve success and fulfillment as women and as scientists.",,2013,63,30,1,False,,329,98583883,W.

329,"No pain, no gain: embodied masculinities and lifestyle sport in Japan","Abstract In postmodern society, the field of consumption has replaced the world of production as the main arena in which dominant stereotypes of masculinity and femininity are communicated and reinforced. Previous research findings suggest that deference to male authority, homosociality, hierarchical junior–senior relationships, conformity and control, and the appreciation of pain and violence are characteristic elements which exaggerate masculine traits and devaluate feminine ones in sports in Japan. My own experiences with rock climbers in Western Japan questions the conventional wisdom of the preponderance of such “masculinity rites” – which overwhelmingly have been observed in highly formalized, competitive, and organized settings. Confronting traditional, mainstream sports with less explored subcultural modes of alternative sport involvement, such as surfing, skateboarding, or climbing, this article explores to what degree hegemonic masculinity has also shaped ideas and ideals of maleness within lifestyle sport and whether these subcultural spaces actually offer the opportunity for the experience of alternative modes of masculinity.",,2013,23,5,2,False,,330,49283397,H.

In this qualitative research on men as kindergarten teachers I analyzed how men in this profession construct masculinity while working with children and during interaction with (mostly female) colleagues, parents, and in the interview situation. Therefore, 10 men teachers were observed for one day in their working environment and interviewed in qualitative interviews. One main theoretical implication was the concept of ‘doing gender’ (e.g. West and Zimmerman 1987, Gildemeister 2004), which was adopted to understand the ‘doing masculinity’ of these men. Another theoretical basis is the concept of hegemonic masculinities by Raewyn Connell (1987, 2006), which was used, critically discussed, and as a result re-conceptualized. The discussion of the theoretical implications and the analysis of the empirical material showed that Connell's theory misses a type of masculinity that opposes hegemonic masculinity, just as her type of ‘complicit masculinities’ supports it. From the interviews and observations a type of ‘alternative masculinity’ was developed.",,2013,63,26,2,False,,332,69575634,Judith S. Mcilwee,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,JournalArticle
332,Work Satisfaction among Women in Nontraditional Occupations,"This article describes sources of work satisfaction and dissatisfaction among a sample of 86 California women entering “nontraditional” (i.e., male-dominated) skilled and semiskilled occupations in 1975. Respondents were interviewed at that time, and again in 1976-1977. The data indicate that the challenge of surviving and succeeding in a nontraditional job—mastering skills, increasing self-confidence, and getting along with (often troublesome) male coworkers and supervisors—was the predominant concern of the respondents in the first year, and was their primary source of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction in their work. In contrast, those women who remained in a nontraditional job one year later had become less concerned with these aspects of the job, and more concerned with the traditional sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction common to blue-collar workers, e.g., the nature of the work itself, working conditions, and relations with management. The findings also suggest that by the second year the perceived advantages of nontraditional work had been counteracted to some extent by the dissatisfactions inherent in those jobs—dissatisfactions that the respondents became more aware of as their nontraditional status in the workplace diminished.",,1982,18,35,1,False,,333,2349351,J.

Using recent scholarship and the emergence of barebacking, the author thinks through the discourses on this sexual culture and how doing so might allow sex education to move beyond merely thinking about sex to a more risky version of sex education. The author's intentions are to counter-intuitively use the figure of the ‘barebacker’ as a lifestyle for thinking through sex education in the twenty-first century to explore potential pedagogical insights where pedagogy is viewed not simply as methods of teaching or the art of teaching but as the process of fashioning the self through relationships with knowledge, the self and other. The phenomenon of the barebacker allows for an exploration of possible ways of coming into presence.

The first step towards such inclusion should be to ensure that teachers are provided with knowledge about lesbian mother families that moves beyond simply refuting stereotypes, and towards acknowledgement of the specific experiences and needs of this family form. However, it is important that educators, when attempting to include lesbian mothers and their children, do not instantiate new norms when attempting to challenge old stereotypes. This paper reports on the development and application of a workshop aimed at providing education students at one South Australian university with a framework for understanding lesbian mother families that is critical of norms in all their forms, including amongst those who research lesbian mother families. It is suggested that the positive findings from the workshop may reflect the utility of challenging both heteronormativity and homonormativity in conjunction with one another so as to present students with a broadly critical approach to sexuality education.",,2013,46,12,1,False,,340,4758170,B.

This paper examines what the revitalisation of interest in feminist thought and practice, especially in Australia, means for geography. We illuminate the trajectory of the feminist revitalisation in new media and beyond through developing a spatial analysis influenced by Rose and Fincher. Notions of paradoxical space and issue publics inform this reading of two pivotal moments in the feminist revitalisation: first, the creation of Destroy the Joint, a campaign launched and maintained in Facebook and Twitter spaces; and second, the Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard's speech against sexism and misogyny in Parliament in October 2012. Both these moments, coming from political and public spaces, received worldwide interest, and we critically examine the context and ramifications of these instances while situating the institutional processes surrounding them within the growing feminist revitalisation. In so doing, we argue that these Australian-based cases indicate a growing feminist movement that is open and multiply focused, connecting personal politics to public campaigning, and achieving material impacts. We conclude that developing a feminist geography of new media is a challenging task, as these spaces circumvent and renegotiate traditional spatial dimensions – including scale and place – through their dynamic networks.

We review current research from a variety of social science disciplines exploring the oft-unquestioned ironic effects of cooperative behavior and conversely, the value of social conflict for positive outcomes – e.g., increased creativity and moral behavior, and concrete social change and equity. Recent reviews of prejudice reduction interventions have shed light on the hazards of exclusively promoting positive attitudes and emotions within and between groups. In complement, we focus on cooperative and conflictual behavior and the consequences thereof. To highlight issues researchers and practitioners should consider when developing social interventions, we summarize some of the common ironic effects of cooperative and conflict behaviors.

345,"Technologies of gender and childbirth choices: Home birth, elective caesarean and white femininities in South Africa","Since the 1970s, feminist research has provided a powerful critique of biomedical models of childbirth. While this critique has been extremely important, it has to some extent led to the neglect of other forms of power. For example, there has been little research which has explored childbirth as a way of ‘doing gender’ in which normative or resistant forms of gender and femininity are (re)performed. Drawing on the Foucauldian notion of ‘technologies of power’, we argue that gender is a form of disciplinary power which shapes the choices that women make in relation to childbirth. Drawing on pre-birth interviews with 21 white, middle-class pregnant South African women who were planning on either a home birth (n = 12) or an elective caesarean section (n = 9), we show how three central technologies of white femininity shaped and regulated women’s childbirth choices. These included: a patriarchal optics of childbirth, the ‘natural childbirth’ ideal and the ‘good mother’ imperative.

351,Diversifying Feminist Ethnographers’ Dilemmas and Solutions,"Avishai, Gerber, and Randles (2013a, 394) describe the feminist dilemma as arising when established “feminist analytic frameworks clash with observations.” All three felt this dilemma when conducting research on groups commonly thought to be “conservative” or “nonfeminist.” They felt unable to reconcile what they imagined was the feminist imperative to privilege the voice of participants with their stated feminist political commitments. In spite of their expectations of male dominance and support of a patriarchal system in the field, they interpreted some of their observations as reflecting feminist ideals. However, they were uncomfortable drawing such conclusions, as they felt pressure to conform to an institutionalized orthodoxy of feminist thought. As self-identified feminists, they worried how other feminists would evaluate their work. To help better navigate this dilemma, the authors encourage “institutional reflexivity,” or critical reflection of how feminist theoretical and methodological orthodoxies “constrain and enable interpretations of the world.” They also encourage feminists to privilege their analytic interpretations over their political projects when this dilemma arises.

356,"Chapter 3 Mothering, Identity Construction, and Visions of the Future Among Low-Income Adolescent Mothers from São Paulo, Brazil","Abstract 
The “moral panic” generated by public response to teenage mothering marginalizes the experiences of young women as mothers, with adolescent pregnancy viewed as catastrophic for young women, their families, and society. In this analysis, focused on the experience of a group of teen women from the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the author explores how the integration of a maternal identity, shaped by Brazilian norms of “good motherhood,” with previously existing identities might lead to new aspirations and ambitions for the future or to hopelessness and despair. 
 
Visions of the future were shaped by individual women’s structural circumstances and fell into four rough groups. Well-established adult women expressed their maternal identity through personal ambition, revealing confidence in their ability to provide “the best” for their children. Some adolescent mothers were fortunate enough to be buffered by family resources so that optimistic objectives for the future that pre-dated the pregnancy remained fairly attainable and were compatible with a “good mother” identity. For teens from less well-off families, motherhood resulted in a new-found determination to succeed in school and work, in line with ideals of Brazilian “good mothering” that focus on working hard to benefit one’s children. Women from the poorest households could or would not conjure a vision of the future, faced with the overwhelming challenges of their circumstances. The detailed, longitudinal qualitative data analyzed here reveal how the construction of maternal identity and visions of the future among adolescent mothers are shaped by the embodied experience of motherhood and pre-existing structural forces.","Marginalized Mothers, Mothering from the Margins",2018,45,0,0,False,,357,34861735,Jessica F.

However, little is known about how welfare state regimes influence these inequalities. Objectives: To examine the relationship between welfare state regimes and gender inequalities in the exposure to work-related psychosocial hazards in Europe, considering occupational social class. Methods: We used a sample of 27, 465 workers from 28 European countries. Dependent variables were high strain, iso-strain, and effort-reward imbalance, and the independent was gender. We calculated the prevalence and prevalence ratio separately for each welfare state regime and occupational social class, using multivariate logistic regression models.

Serving the interests and aspirations of low-wage immigrant women workers with limited English-language skills, AIWA confronts diffuse and differential forms of interlocking oppression and deploys intersectionality to help activists change multiple states of subordinated voicelessness and devaluation into an empowered sense of self-representation and self-activity. For AIWA, an intersectional optic on social movement struggles creates insurgent identities that are dynamic and dialogic, more fluid and flexible than single-axis approaches. AIWA does not embrace intersectionality simply because its members have been wounded by racism, sexism, imperialism, class exploitation, and language discrimination but because each realm of these experiences has helped the organization to see how power works and how new identities are needed to combat its intersectional reach and scope. AIWA’s deployment of intersectionality stems from the fact that the very problems its members face are themselves both intersectional and radical.",Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society,2013,49,185,8,False,,363,2094014855,Z.

367,The ethics of infant male circumcision,"Is the non-therapeutic circumcision of infant males morally permissible? The most recent major development in this long-simmering debate was the 2012 release of a policy statement and technical report on circumcision by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). In these documents, the US paediatricians’ organisation claimed that the potential health benefits of infant circumcision now outweigh the risks and costs. They went on to suggest that their analysis could be taken to justify the decision of parents to choose circumcision for their incompetent children.1

### Circumcision and ‘health benefits’

The AAP's pronouncement unleashed a firestorm of commentary, much of it censorious. In this issue, human rights attorney J Steven Svoboda and Professor of Clinical Paediatrics Robert Van Howe take the AAP to taski for committing numerous significant errors, both in their analysis of relevant evidence and in basic medical-ethical reasoning.3 In addition, an independent international panel—composed of 38 leading paediatricians, paediatric surgeons, urologists, medical ethicists and heads of hospital boards and children's health societies—has likewise condemned the findings of the AAP. Writing in the journal Pediatrics , these authors state: Only one of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys, which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss. The other claimed health benefits, including protection against HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and penile cancer, are questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves.4

My own analysis of the AAP documents—and of ‘health benefits’ defences of circumcision generally—can be found elsewhere.5 Let me turn my attention in this editorial, then, to …",Journal of Medical Ethics,2013,32,34,2,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Only one of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys, which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss.'}",368,2064637290,David P.

368,"Circumcision, sexual dysfunction and the child's best interests: why the anatomical details matter","In his contribution to the Journal of Medical Ethics , Joseph Mazor1 makes a logical case, based on the premises underlying his reasoning, for his article's primary thesis: he concludes that parents have the prerogative to determine the ‘best interests’ of their infant son in a circumcision decision. If the facts of the matter were ultimately no different from what he adduces, one could admit the soundness of his argument. But the paper is flawed by some questionable assumptions and grievous incompleteness.

First, the author insufficiently explores the profound implications of a serious equivocation in the term ‘circumcision’ that is common throughout the literature. He does superficially reference the article on ‘Circumcision’ in The Jewish Encyclopedia , which describes in detail the actual steps involved in brit milah versus brit periah .2 Despite this general allusion, though, he hardly discusses the matter further, as though the distinction were practically irrelevant. It does have fundamental import, however. Milah is merely a token clip of the very tip (the overhang flap or akroposthion ) of the prepuce, which leaves most of the organ system (including all its essential functions) intact. This was evidently the version practiced in biblical times under the old Abrahamic–Mosaic covenant, before the Talmudic guardians of Judaic ethnic and religious identity proposed (around 150 AD) a means to prevent Hellinising Jewish men from attempting foreskin restoration by stretching their remaining preputial tissue forward. The rabbis mandated the replacement of milah with the more drastic procedure of periah , a radical surgery that cuts and tears from the penis its entire covering, leaving the glans irreversibly denuded. Unlike traditional milah , the innovation of periah necessarily has significant adverse consequences (delineated below).

Second, Mazor concedes that circumcision ( periah ) might cause a ‘moderate’ reduction of sexual pleasure in the lad's …",Journal of Medical Ethics,2013,28,16,2,False,,369,49287248,M. Preston,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

370,Shaving It All Off: Examining Social Norms of Body Hair among College Men in a Women's Studies Course,"As a field only four decades old, women’s studies has undergone sweeping changes since its inception in the early 1970s. Striving to shed light on the trappings of gender roles, the dangers of patriarchal power, and the fundamental inequalities that drive social relationships, women’s studies has always prioritized progressive social change (hooks 43; Shrewsbury 9). Responding to criticisms by sympathetic feminists of its overly White, middleclass orientation, women’s studies programs and departments have devoted significant effort to recruiting and retaining a more diverse group of scholars, students, and faculty. In particular, women of color, sexual minorities, older women, and men have entered the field in greater numbers and have changed the face of women’s studies across the U.S. and throughout the world. Women’s studies programs report more men taking women’s studies courses, more male women’s studies majors and minors, and more male women’s studies faculty members than ever before (Wiegman 106); efforts to recruit and retain gay men have been particularly at the forefront of recent women’s studies program priorities. Despite this, men’s experiences in the field of women’s studies remain an understudied phenomenon, particularly for the pedagogical and structural implications of designing and implementing effective, far-reaching women’s studies curricula that account for gender diversity and men’s lived experiences. Men in women’s studies courses are often faced with a number of unfamiliar predicaments: they suddenly find themselves the minority in the classroom (particularly for men in business and",,2013,31,23,4,False,,371,72885998,Michael Armato,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
371,Wolves in Sheep's Clothing: Men's Enlightened Sexism & Hegemonic Masculinity in Academia,"In the spring of 2008, I presided over and served as discussant for a session on hegemonic masculinity at a regional sociology conference. Going into the 8:30 a.m. session, my primary concern was that such an early time slot would fail to garner sufficient audience turnout to facilitate critical discussion. My concern was confirmed when only four attendees showed up. Despite the low turnout, quite a lively session followed, including an admittedly odd series of events wherein we paradoxically produced the hegemonic masculinity we were supposed to be challenging. The unfolding of the session prompted the development of ideas presented in this article. As I will show, the content and processes of academic engagement often evidence what I call “enlightened sexism,” attitudes and actions expressed and undertaken by men that on the surface appear to be gender egalitarian, but which actually support men’s privilege and women’s oppression. The thinking and actions associated with enlightened sexism are related to the development of academic masculinity, a form of masculinity that is best characterized not as an individual identity, but as the outgrowth of collective projects produced through the ordinary goings on within academic institutions. On the surface, men who embody academic masculinity appear enlightened and are often considered “good guys,” relatively sensitive men who know about “women’s issues” and can discuss feminist concerns. I argue that it is precisely academic men’s “enlightenment” that holds the potential to allow them to accrue masculine privileges, while doing little to challenge gender or other inequalities.

I suggest there is cause for concern in the way critics of the DSM have reframed sexual problems as understandable and adaptive responses to stressful life situations as this hovers close to a troublesome reinscription of women as less desirous than men.

Sexual violence against children and women brings with it long-term sequelae, both psychiatrically and socially. Apart from sexual gratification itself, sexual violence against women is often a result of unequal power equations both real and perceived between men and women and is also strongly influenced by cultural factors and values. Within sociocentric and ego-centric cultures, the roles and representations of genders, and attitudes toward sexual violence differ. Cultures which are described as feminist, provide equal power to both men and women. Sexual violence is likely to occur more commonly in cultures that foster beliefs of perceived male superiority and social and cultural inferiority of women.

384,Language as a Cognitive Tool to Imagine Goals in Curiosity-Driven Exploration,"Developmental machine learning studies how artificial agents can model the way children learn open-ended repertoires of skills. Such agents need to create and represent goals, select which ones to pursue and learn to achieve them. Recent approaches have considered goal spaces that were either fixed and hand-defined or learned using generative models of states. This limited agents to sample goals within the distribution of known effects. We argue that the ability to imagine out-of-distribution goals is key to enable creative discoveries and open-ended learning. Children do so by leveraging the compositionality of language as a tool to imagine descriptions of outcomes they never experienced before, targeting them as goals during play. We introduce Imagine, an intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning architecture that models this ability. Such imaginative agents, like children, benefit from the guidance of a social peer who provides language descriptions. To take advantage of goal imagination, agents must be able to leverage these descriptions to interpret their imagined out-of-distribution goals. This generalization is made possible by modularity: a decomposition between learned goal-achievement reward function and policy relying on deep sets, gated attention and object-centered representations. We introduce the Playground environment and study how this form of goal imagination improves generalization and exploration over agents lacking this capacity. In addition, we identify the properties of goal imagination that enable these results and study the impacts of modularity and social interactions.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2020,84,64,5,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is argued that the ability to imagine out-of-distribution goals is key to enable creative discoveries and open-ended learning, and Imagine, an intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning architecture that models this ability is introduced.'}",385,118370634,Jaime D.

386,Borderland Queer: Narrative Approaches in Clinical Work with Latina Women Who Have Sex with Women (WSW),"This article seeks to examine the use of narrative approaches as an effective counseling technique for exploring and validating the multi-layering oppressions often encountered by Latina women who have sex with women (WSW). Research exploring the lives and perspectives of Latina WSW remains a newly charted field with possibilities for acquiring information about sexual identity and best practices in working with this community. Their sexual minority status coupled with ethnic/racial gender identities present the added challenges of racism and sexism. To fully meet the specific needs of this population within a mental health setting, counselors must utilize an empowering approach that will draw from the strengths of the Latina WSW community, which will allow for open expressions of experiences and validation of their unique narratives. In this article, the author explores the relevant literature and proposes that narrative techniques can be powerful tools in addressing the racism, homophobia, and sexism that affect the lives of Latina WSW.",,2013,35,5,0,False,,387,25696566,Dawn M.

387,"Asian Cultural Values, Internalized Heterosexism, and Sexual Orientation Disclosure Among Asian American Sexual Minority Persons","The purpose of this study was to examine how cultural-specific influences effect dimensions of sexual identity experience among 143 Asian American lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) persons using a web-based Internet survey. Findings revealed that more adherence to Asian values was positively related to internalized heterosexism (also known as internalized homophobia) and negatively related to sexual orientation disclosure to others. Results also indicated that internalized heterosexism mediated and moderated the relationship between adherence to Asian values and sexual orientation disclosure. In terms of mediation, findings were consistent with the notion that more adherence to Asian cultural values leads to more internalized heterosexism, which in turn leads to less willingness to be out. In terms of moderation, results revealed that the difference between the high and low internalized heterosexism groups occurs at the lower levels of adherence to Asian values when LGBQ persons who have less internalized heterosexism have more sexual orientation disclosure. Results illustrate the complex ways that culture specific values and processes influence two important aspects of the coming out process.",,2013,47,30,1,False,,388,49667809,K.

389,Development and initial validation of The Sexual Orientation Beliefs Scale (SOBS).,"The purpose of these studies was to develop and validate a measure of beliefs about sexual orientation (SO) that incorporates essentialist, social constructionist, and constructivist themes. The Sexual Orientation Beliefs Scale (SOBS) is offered as a multidimensional instrument with which to assess a broad range of beliefs about SO, which evidence suggests are highly correlated with positive and negative attitudes about sexual minorities. An initial exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in the general population with a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender-identified (LGBT) sample (n = 323) and suggested a 4-factor structure of naturalness (α = .86), discreetness (α = .82), entitativity (α = .75), and personal and social importance (α = .68); this 4-factor structure was supported by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with an independent LGBT sample (n = 330; ""Form 1""). Additional EFA (n = 183) and CFA (n = 201) in a college student, mostly heterosexual-identified population suggest a slightly different factor structure, whereby group homogeneity (α = .84) and informativeness (α = .77) are salient themes (""Form 2""), and this structure was replicated across SO groups.

390,The meaning and role of ideology in system justification and resistance for high- and low-status people.,"In this article we explore how beliefs about system ideals and the achievement of those ideals differentially predict system justification among low- and high-status groups. Our goal was to reconcile how people can promote system ideals such as equal opportunities for all and at the same time recognize that group-based disparities are, in part, due to these unfulfilled ideals. Three studies examined whether people perceived a discrepancy between a system's ideal goals and its achievement of those goals. Everyone endorsed these goal ideals more than they believed that the goals were being achieved; however, this discrepancy was larger for low-status people. The larger the perceived discrepancy, the more dissatisfied people were with the system and the more likely they were to support hierarchy-attenuating policies. Studies 2 and 3 also examined people's motivation for endorsing goal ideals. People of all statuses endorsed system ideals to promote an ideal system more than to legitimize the actual system (Study 2); however, high-status people were slightly more likely to endorse system ideals to legitimize the actual system than low-status people (Study 3). In summary, low-status people were more likely than high-status people to recognize discrepancies between system goals and system outcomes, show dissatisfaction with the American system, and prefer policies that would attenuate extant hierarchies.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2013,87,51,4,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Low-status people were more likely than high- status people to recognize discrepancies between system goals and system outcomes, show dissatisfaction with the American system, and prefer policies that would attenuate extant hierarchies.'}",391,4269316,Jill Chonody,50524453,K.

In this article, we explore the nuanced nature of stereotypes about immigrants and how they relate to ambivalent attitudes toward immigrant groups and the disparate array of immigration policies that affect them. Using item response theory and multiple regression analysis, we identified and related stereotypes of different immigrant groups to group-based and policy attitudes. Results demonstrate that ambivalent stereotypes mapped onto ambivalent group-based and immigration policy attitudes. Specifically, stereotypes that portray groups in positive or sympathetic ways predicted positive attitudes toward the group and more supportive attitudes toward policies that facilitate their immigration to the United States. Conversely, negative qualities predicted negative attitudes toward the same group and support for policies that prevent the group from immigrating. Results are discussed in light of current theory related to stereotype content, complementarity of stereotypes, and broader implications for immigration attitudes and policy.",Cultural diversity & ethnic minority psychology,2013,53,37,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Investigating the nuanced nature of stereotypes about immigrants and how they relate to ambivalent attitudes toward immigrant groups and the disparate array of immigration policies that affect them demonstrates that ambivalent stereotypes mapped onto ambivalent group-based and immigration policy attitudes.'}",396,5241222,E.

397,"Showtime’s ‘female problem’: Cancer, quality and motherhood","Since the debut of the TV series Weeds in 2005, the cable network Showtime has developed a reputation for programming content based on the anti-heroine mother protagonist. This programming trend – which also includes The United States of Tara, Nurse Jackie and, most recently, The Big C – demonstrates the network’s success. In this way, Showtime pushes against the dominant trends of ‘quality television’s’ preference for male-centered programs (The Sopranos, The Wire, etc.) with narratives featuring middle-aged females and the contemporary issues that they face as women and mothers. I use theorist Diane Negra’s notion of ‘time-anxiety’ trope in postfeminist representations of women, motherhood, consumerism and time. For Negra, the ‘time-anxiety’ trope is a marketing tool based on the biological categorization of essential female experiences, which include themes of motherhood, marriage and anti-aging. Turing to trade and magazine publications, I use the term ‘female problem’ to investigate Showtime’s programming and marketing based on female mental and physical illness and its relevance to a broader, postmodern female experience. Using The Big C as a case study, I am interested in the show’s depiction of cancer as a larger cultural metaphor for the failures of motherhood and anxieties around consumerism. At the same time, the show’s investment in female experience fails to account for female bodies that differ from the white, middle-class and youthful protagonist.",,2013,38,9,1,False,,398,15051627,Heidi L.

402,"Women’s March Colloquy - The Long Weekend: Exclusion, Intrusion, Trolls, and Punks","This essay describes the indie punk scene in Washington, DC, in the days approaching and immediately after the Women’s March 2017. The scene became a cultural target of the right, as musicians were threatened by online trolls from 4chan and other rightwing message boards, culminating in the “Pizzagate”-inspired attack on the venue, Comet Ping Pong. Musicians staged a series of concerts and performances around the march, helping to dispel the sense of threat through intersectional political congregation as well as maintaining a longer steady protest locally. In this article, I will describe the local lead-up to the weekend of the Women’s March, including a protest concert the night before and an after-party the night of the march. The narrative draws out the growing sense of threat to musicians as online trolls from right-wing message boards became active. Then, the narrative continues to detail the ways in which the two events at the rock venues dispelled the fear through intersectional political congregation. I hope that this article offers insight on how eclectic urban musics that embolden the left can also provide cultural targets for the right. I am writing not only as a music scholar, but also as a resident of the nation’s capital embedded in a music scene and economic bracket and as a US citizen making sense of socio-political shifts. This article allows for this blur, eschewing the detached writing of scholarship and provocative agit-prop of activism. I write as a concerned local interlocutor who is fluent, at least, in speaking of music’s role in social change. As a research method, I worked my way outward from friends after the Women’s March to other participants through a series of interviews. My goal is to bring together the role of the Internet in musical and political action, a widening economic gap expressed culturally, and the ways in which music can simultaneously activate intersectional politics and animate deep antipathy. Visibly Divided: A Quick Backdrop Beginning with the post-Fordist turn of the 1970s, consumption began to underpin the US economy. Connections between urban manufacturing and rural goods began to wither in the new information economy. Painting with broad strokes, there now exists a heightened polarization that overlaps class, consumption, culture, politics, and geography—visible to anyone with access to the internet. Rural America has more visual access to less-accessible cultural and economic worlds. These worlds include DC’s gastronomic treats: vinegar and smoke-infused cocktails, fusion foods, and expensive coffees. 2 Music and Politics Winter 2019 Today, both cultural capital and real capital are becoming requisites for living in cities. Like all other US cities, DC has grown as a model of progressivism versus conservatism, including specifically the rise of the creative class. Hip and “enlightened” consumerism abounds (see Currid-Halkett 2017). Neighborhoods devastated from the 1968 riots now boast million-dollar row houses. Recent newcomers tend to be single white professionals who marry and begin families. DC has become whiter, wealthier, and younger. Amenities bring the wealthy professional class and ancillary service jobs engage the poor. As Richard Florida has recently written, the middle class is left out of city life.1 Alongside this demographic gap, there appears an empathy and values gap. Trolling Underground Art Rock: The Initial Threats to Individuals During the lead up to the weekend of the inauguration and march, many Washington residents felt a sense of threat. There was a sense of uncertainty for the many people who work in federal institutions. Independent musicians were also braced, standing ground under another threat from the alt-right. The threat began slowly and continued steadily across the scene. Washington has the distinction of having a politically-minded punk scene since the late 1970s—a scene that continues to evolve musically and ideologically. For decades, this scene has built an infrastructure of musical practice and political action, many of whom were hosts to the hundreds of thousands who came to protest. That infrastructure was both under threat and employed in the events leading up to and immediately following the march. On November 4, the Friday before the 2016 election, Amanda Kleinman received an email from a stranger. Getting emails from strangers was normal. She had been playing in independent experimental rock bands for decades and had an associated internet presence. This email, however, was unusual. It came from ProtonMail, a Switzerland-based encrypted email service. “Are the children safe,” the message read, “or are you the monster?” Perhaps it was in response to the dark imagery and her bad humor—part of her band’s aesthetic. In her first attempt to understand the source of the email, Kleinman thought back a few decades. “It seemed as if it was part of the Satanic panic of the 1980s,” she recalls. That night, Kleinman forwarded the email to Erick Jackson, her bandmate in the local rock band Heavy Breathing. Jackson did some research to discover that there was significant activity on WikiLeaks, a whistleblowing website that releases classified information to the public. Users were connecting Kleinman and their band to the website’s release of Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Party emails. Furious activity on several message boards had been “decoding” John Podesta’s leaked emails.2 Forum members honed in on pizza orders that Podesta and his staff were making to Comet Ping Pong, a local pizza restaurant that hosts a well-regarded local music series where Heavy Breathing had played recently. On the message boards, someone determined that orders for “cheese pizza” were code for “child pornography.” The “decoding” devolved from there. Ice cream surely meant male prostitute and salad dressing on the side was code for certain bodily fluids. The suggestion that someone would put walnut sauce on a pizza indicated to conspiracy theorists that the Democrats were not really talking about 1 Richard Florida, The New Urban Crisis: How Our Cities Are Increasing Inequality, Deepening Segregation, and Failing the Middle Class and What We Can Do About It (New York: Basic Books, 2017); see also Richard V. Reeves, Dream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class Is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust, Why That Is a Problem, and What to Do About It (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 2017). 2 See Gregor Aisch, Jon Huang, and Cecilia Kang, “Dissecting the #PizzaGate Conspiracy Theories,” The New York Times, December 10, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html. The Long Weekend: Exclusion, Intrusion, Trolls, and Punks 3 pizza—whereas to urbanite foodies, the combination was a vegan refinement of pesto. The conspiracy, now termed “Pizzagate,” had moved to Alex Jones’ Infowars Internet radio show two days before Kleinman received the threatening email. Through his far-right conspiracy theory website, Jones claimed that Comet was home to a child sex slave den led by Comet owner James Alefantis and that Clinton herself “has personally murdered and chopped up” children there. Meanwhile, the message board activity continued. A transcript of a birthday roast given by Kleinman to Sasha Lord, who booked bands at Comet, had been analyzed in great detail. The roast involved a ski mask, sunglasses, and a pitch-shifter that, as part of Heavy Breathing’s regular act, transformed Kleinman into “The Majestic Ape.” People tried to connect Kleinman to Alefantis. Were they the same person? Was the roast part of a ritual before the slaughter of children? “They don’t understand art,” says Kleinman who is also a photographer and works at the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design. Rock has had an art mode since British art school graduates like Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and John Lennon of the Beatles began representing the genre. But most of the innovation in independent art-rock these days remains underground in urban areas. In part, interpretation of Heavy Breathing’s act is determined by class and geography. The internet, however, has provided access across those divisions. Soon after Kleinman received the first email, other threats came via Facebook Messenger. By the time of the presidential election, threats had spilled into the comments on her YouTube videos and personal Instagram account. Then came calls to her workplace. Deans at the Corcoran received calls like, “Do you know that you employ a pedophile monster?!” The school enhanced its shooter training for her office. She began tracking down the trolls. In some cases, she used Facebook to identify the trolls’ mothers and informed them about what their (mostly grown) children were doing to her. In other cases, she found that messages came from paid troll farms in Malaysia and Madagascar. In one YouTube video, a man threatened to gut her with a knife—which he described in detail. She was able to identify him as a border patrol agent and contacted his supervisor. But striking back was futile. With each offensive move, new threats emerged with redoubled vengeance. Threatening Alternative Venues The lack of institutional support for independent musicians forces music into unconventional and more precarious spaces. Much of the creative music in DC happens in alternative music venues connected by word-of-mouth. With the rise of social media, the internet has given greater visibility to what had been under the radar—and not only visibility to potential concertgoers. Far-right message boards found an opportunity to investigate and target alternative venues following the tragic fire at the Ghost Ship building on December 2, 2016 in Oakland. This warehouse-turned-arts collective caught fire killing 36 people during a record release show for 100% Silk Records, an independent label for electronic dance music.

To advance knowledge of these dialogues, this qualitative study explores heterosexual students' motivations and expectations, challenges, and learning outcomes related to their participation in intergroup dialogue courses on sexual orientation. Core themes include desire to learn about the LGB community, concerns about offending classmates, anxiety around LGB stigma, conflict with classmates around controversial topics, affirming LGB people, and learning about heterosexism, privilege, and intersectionality of identity.

408,"Work–Life Balance and Parenthood: A Comparative Review of Definitions, Equity and Enrichment","This review investigates the problems of definition and inequity with which the literature on parenthood and work–life balance is beset. It analyses research trajectories first within the established disciplines of organizational psychology and the sociologies of work and family practices, and then within the newer field of management studies. Gender, class and difference are singled out as troubling themes, especially in relation to fathers and impoverished parents. A tendency towards mono-disciplinarity is observed within organizational psychology and sociologies of work and family practices. The review offers explanations for the historic but narrow definition within organizational psychology and sociologies of work and family practices of work–life balance as affecting mainly heterosexual dual-career parent couples. The authors show how this narrow definition has led to inequities within research. They further identify as limiting the definition of work–life balance to be always ‘problematic’, rather than enriching, among employed parents. Consequently, a three-factor framework is recommended, through which future studies may address the problems of definition and equity in work–life balance literature, including: a broader definition of work–life balance to include marginalized parents; the defining of parenting and employment as potentially life-enriching; and a commendation of the transdisciplinary approach within management studies as poised to move debate forward.",,2013,115,79,6,False,,409,8250341,L.

410,The use of sexual controversy in South African advertising: A pragmatic analysis,"Abstract This article is based on an investigation of printed South African advertisements in which sexual controversy is deliberately used as a strategy to draw attention. The dataset is a collection of Afrikaans- and English-medium advertisements selected from popular South African magazines published between 2000 and 2010. The purpose of the research is to offer an insight into the nature of controversy as a mechanism in the South African media and to categorise the dataset primarily by means of a pragmatic analysis to identify the implied marketing message. Controversy in the advertisements was associated with themes related to sex, such as nudity, sexism, health and safety issues, and indecent language usage. The research investigated the exploitation of pragmatic instruments, in order to evoke controversy in advertisements, such as the transgression of the conditions governing conversation according to Grice's (1989) Co-operative Principle and the maxims of conversation. A study of controversial advertising may offer a deeper understanding of modern society. As expected, the results indicate that sex still sells and that sexual controversy is by no means fixed or age and culturally bound. Moreover, the character of the advertisements is nowadays very often an intellectual game which requires the target market's cognitive involvement and inter-textual knowledge.",,2013,27,4,0,False,,411,2173926248,Miwako Kato Homma,3779036,R.

412,Science Interests in Preschool Boys and Girls: Relations to Later Self-Concept and Science Achievement.,"Although young children display various types of interests, little is known regarding the potential impact of these interests on subsequent learning and development. Of particular importance is the question of whether or not children's early interests are instrumental in their later academic achievement. The current study fills this gap in the interest literature by longitudinally investigating the relationship between 116 children's early science interests and their subsequent self-concepts and science-related academic achievement, with particular emphasis placed on gender. The intensity and content of children's science interests between the ages of 4 and 6 (i.e., preschool interests) and between the ages of 6 and 8 (i.e., elementary school interests) were used as predictors of age 8 self-concept and science achievement. Boys displayed higher overall levels of science interests than girls, though interest was not related to boys’ self-concepts. Girls’ early intense science interests were related to higher science self-concepts at age 8. In addition, early interests predicted science achievement in girls but not in boys. In conclusion, it appears that early science interest may be a critical supporting factor for girls in fostering positive self-concepts and higher science achievement scores. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

413,Love It or Leave It: Norwegian Students' Motivations and Expectations for Postcompulsory Physics.,"In response to insufficient participation and female underrepresentation in physics education, this article uses questionnaire data from Norwegian physics students in upper secondary (N = 585) and first-year tertiary (N = 278) education to characterize the “physics choosers.” An expectancy-value perspective is adopted to describe the motivations and expectations behind the respondents’ physics choice. Three choice profiles were identified among secondary students. The intrinsic and extrinsic profile, broadly motivated by interest-enjoyment, expectation of success, and utility for university admission; the extrinsic profile emphasizing mainly utility; and the intrinsic profile emphasizing mainly interest-enjoyment. Females were underrepresented in the intrinsic profile. Many secondary students did not know what kind of job they wanted, but those who did, aspired to go into medicine (particularly females) or engineering (particularly males). Tertiary students were motivated by a passion for physics and high expectation of enjoyment, and many of them planned to go into research. Tertiary students were more likely than secondary students to value idealistic purposes in a future career. The results imply that participation in physics may be improved by targeting students with a broader motivation than interest alone, through inclusive classroom practices, support of students’ self-concepts, and examples of physics applications and physics-related careers available. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

415,Sticks and stones: the multifarious effects of body-based harassment on young girls' healthy lifestyle choices,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of girls and boys about the effects that body-based harassment would have on girls' eating habits and engagement in physical activity. Five scenarios were read to focus groups comprised of 12- to 14-year-old students in grades 7 and 8. Each scenario represented behaviours that fall within the definition of body-based harassment. The students were asked how they thought the target of the behaviour felt when it occurred, how they would be likely to respond and why they thought the harasser engaged in the behaviour. Results corroborated previous literature that body-based harassment can have a negative effect on eating patterns of young girls and can be a contributing factor to disordered eating. Additional results suggested that body-based harassment could play a role in altering participation in physical activity and sport in two negative directions; impetus for dropping out of activity and motivation to become a pathological exerciser.

In support of our argument that there exists an immediate need for equity programming within physical education in higher education, we present the results from two interconnected studies designed to make transparent: (1) the demographic character of faculties of Kinesiology and Physical Education across Canada; as well as (2) the delivery of content related to race, diversity and whiteness within the curriculum. In the first study, we collected website representations of faculty and staff (i.e. photos) as well as lists of curricular offerings for each of the member institutions of the Canadian Council of University Physical Education and Kinesiology Administrators. Website documents were downloaded, analyzed and organized according to criteria related to race and diversity. The follow-up study consisted of interviews with 40 faculty members across Canada where we asked questions pertaining to their perceptions of the faculty setting (i.e. the demographic make-up of their faculty including faculty, staff and students as well as the culture within the faculty) and the curriculum. As a method of triangulation, interview data was used to confirm and inform our analysis of the initial website data; when combined, the analyses provide a comprehensive picture of the cultures of whiteness that exist within physical education in higher education. In order for physical education to be truly inclusive, we call for the development of greater alliances across disciplines and geographic borders such that the hegemony of whiteness within the (physical education) academy can be disrupted.",,2013,53,56,12,False,,417,8325741,Julie A.

417,Validation of alternative indicators of social support in perinatal outcomes research using quality of the partner relationship.,"AIM
To test alternatives to the current research and clinical practice of assuming that married or partnered status is a proxy for positive social support.


BACKGROUND
Having a partner is assumed to relate to better health status via the intermediary process of social support. However, women's health research indicates that having a partner is not always associated with positive social support.


DESIGN
An exploratory post hoc analysis focused on posttraumatic stress and childbearing was conducted using a large perinatal database from 2005-2009.


METHODS
To operationalize partner relationship, four variables were analysed: partner ('yes' or 'no'), intimate partner violence ('yes' or 'no'), the combination of those two factors, and the woman's appraisal of the quality of her partner relationship via a single item. Construct validity of these four alternative variables was assessed in relation to appraisal of the partner's social support in labour and the postpartum using linear regression standardized betas and adjusted R-squares. Predictive validity was assessed using unadjusted and adjusted linear regression modelling.


RESULTS
Four groups were compared. Married, abused women differed most from married, not abused women in relation to the social support, and depression outcomes used for validity checks. The variable representing the women's appraisals of their partner relationships accounts for the most variance in predicting depression scores.

421,Some factors underlying individual differences in speech recognition on PRESTO: a first report.,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies investigating speech recognition in adverse listening conditions have found extensive variability among individual listeners. However, little is currently known about the core underlying factors that influence speech recognition abilities.


PURPOSE
To investigate sensory, perceptual, and neurocognitive differences between good and poor listeners on the Perceptually Robust English Sentence Test Open-set (PRESTO), a new high-variability sentence recognition test under adverse listening conditions.


RESEARCH DESIGN
Participants who fell in the upper quartile (HiPRESTO listeners) or lower quartile (LoPRESTO listeners) on key word recognition on sentences from PRESTO in multitalker babble completed a battery of behavioral tasks and self-report questionnaires designed to investigate real-world hearing difficulties, indexical processing skills, and neurocognitive abilities.


STUDY SAMPLE
Young, normal-hearing adults (N = 40) from the Indiana University community participated in the current study.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Participants' assessment of their own real-world hearing difficulties was measured with a self-report questionnaire on situational hearing and hearing health history. Indexical processing skills were assessed using a talker discrimination task, a gender discrimination task, and a forced-choice regional dialect categorization task. Neurocognitive abilities were measured with the Auditory Digit Span Forward (verbal short-term memory) and Digit Span Backward (verbal working memory) tests, the Stroop Color and Word Test (attention/inhibition), the WordFam word familiarity test (vocabulary size), the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) self-report questionnaire on executive function, and two performance subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Performance Intelligence Quotient (IQ; nonverbal intelligence). Scores on self-report questionnaires and behavioral tasks were tallied and analyzed by listener group (HiPRESTO and LoPRESTO).


RESULTS
The extreme groups did not differ overall on self-reported hearing difficulties in real-world listening environments. However, an item-by-item analysis of questions revealed that LoPRESTO listeners reported significantly greater difficulty understanding speakers in a public place. HiPRESTO listeners were significantly more accurate than LoPRESTO listeners at gender discrimination and regional dialect categorization, but they did not differ on talker discrimination accuracy or response time, or gender discrimination response time. HiPRESTO listeners also had longer forward and backward digit spans, higher word familiarity ratings on the WordFam test, and lower (better) scores for three individual items on the BRIEF-A questionnaire related to cognitive load. The two groups did not differ on the Stroop Color and Word Test or either of the WASI performance IQ subtests.


CONCLUSIONS
HiPRESTO listeners and LoPRESTO listeners differed in indexical processing abilities, short-term and working memory capacity, vocabulary size, and some domains of executive functioning.

This is an ingenious move – discussing the interplay between sexism and commercialism through discourse on minors can circumvent retorts to feminist claims about the harms of sexist culture that ‘well, that's her choice’. Yet such discourses also necessarily render morally problematic any expression of sexuality or desire for the female subject under discussion, since the ‘girl’ is understood as prior to sexual consent. Debating sexism over the bodies of ‘girls’ therefore has had the unintended consequence of generating a replay of the ‘sex wars’, a debate between different feminist camps over whether consent can be meaningful.

428,“There Must be Some Way Out of Here”: Why the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities is Potentially the Best Weapon in the Fight Against Sanism,"It is impossible to consider the impact of anti-discrimination law on persons with mental disabilities without a full understanding of how sanism permeates all aspects of the legal system – judicial opinions, legislation, the role of lawyers, juror decision-making – and the entire fabric of society. For those unfamiliar with the term, I define “sanism” as an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry, 1 that permeates all aspects of mental disability law and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: litigants, fact finders, counsel, and expert and lay witnesses. 2  Notwithstanding over two decades of anti-discrimination laws 3 and, in many jurisdictions, an impressive corpus of constitutional case law and state statutes, 4 the attitudes of judges, jurors and lawyers often reflect the same level of bigotry that defined this area of law half a century ago. 5 The reasons for this are complex and, to a great extent, flow from centuries of prejudice – often hidden prejudice, often socially acceptable prejudice 6 – that has persisted in spite of prophylactic legislative and judicial reforms, and – at least superficially – an apparent uptick in public awareness. I have railed multiple times about the “irrational,” “corrosive”, “malignant” and “ravaging” effects of sanism, but its “pernicious power” still poisons all of mental disability law. 7  The recently-ratified Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is the most revolutionary international human rights document – ever – that applies to persons with disabilities. The Disability Convention furthers the human rights approach to disability and recognizes the right of people with disabilities to equality in most every aspect of life. It firmly endorses a social model of disability – a clear and direct repudiation of the medical model that traditionally was part-and-parcel of mental disability law. It calls for “respect for inherent dignity” and “non-discrimination.” Subsequent articles declare “freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,” “freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse,” and a right to protection of the “integrity of the person.”  In this paper, I consider the impact that the Convention is likely to have on sanism. First, I will briefly discuss both our sanist past and our sanist present. Then, I will consider how the CRPD has the greatest potential for combating sanism, and for changing social attitudes. In this latter inquiry, I will also draw on the tools of therapeutic jurisprudence. Then, I will offer some brief and modest conclusions.",,2013,84,14,1,True,,429,34907261,V. Ingle,6108233,P.

431,Employing a Black Feminist Approach to Doctoral Advising: Preparing Black Women for the Professoriate,"Advising has been identified as a strategy that influences the retention and graduation of many underrepresented populations in higher education including, students of color and women. For Black women, multiple identities, including race and gender, intersect in ways that need acknowledgement during the socialization process. Given the growing numbers of Black women earning doctoral degrees, the authors propose a renewed focus on advising using a Black Feminist approach for advising process Black women. This conceptual essay will outline the differences between mentoring and advising, identifying the tasks and features of the advising relationship potentially needed to ensure the success of Black women graduate students who aspire to enter the professoriate.Keywords: advising, doctoral students, Black womenSince the turn of the 21st century, the number of Black females entering doctoral programs-and ultimately, the professoriate-has been steadily on the rise. Black women are attaining doctoral degrees at the highest levels in history and currently have the largest faculty presence of all women of color (Ryu, 2010). In 1989, Black women represented only 2.1% of fiill-time faculty nationwide (Benjamin, 1997. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education (2010), this number had doubled to 4% by 2009. In the fall of 2009, African American women accounted for the largest proportion of female faculty of color at 8.6%. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of Black female doctorate recipients increased from 60% to 66% (Survey of Earned Doctorates Fact Sheet, 2008). Currently, Black women are outpacing their Black male counterparts as new members of the professoriate. In the fall of 2009, Black women made up the majority (57%) of Black assistant professors across the country (Chronicle of Higher Education, 2010). These trends show that the status of Black women faculty is becoming increasingly significant in the new millennium.In this conceptual article, the authors will identify the responsibilities, functions, and characteristics for faculty in the doctoral advising relationship that are needed to ensure the success of Black female doctoral students who aspire to enter the professoriate. Black female doctoral students separate from Black males are highlighted due to the continued need to better understand these women's experiences in higher education (Williams, 2001). For Black women, multiple identities, including race and gender, intersect (Crenshaw, 1989; Hill Collins, 2000) in ways that need acknowledgement during the doctoral student socialization process (Bertrand Jones & Osborne-Lampkin, in press). Black women faculty are forced to invalidate stereotypes and legitimize their competence, intelligence, and overall worth (Benjamin, 1997; Hill Collins, 1986; hooks, 1989), especially at predominantly White institutions (PWIs). Black female doctoral students with faculty career aspirations should be advised of both the benefits and challenges of a future faculty career. The authors assert that advising can be used to help mitigate the challenges that Black female doctoral students experience and potentially face as new faculty in academe.Black feminist thought is used as a framework for doctoral student advising occurring at PWIs, where the potential pool of available Black, female doctoral advisors are dismally low. Despite the encouraging statistics presented previously, Black females still do not represent a critical mass of college and university faculty, especially at PWIs. Currently, Black women faculty represent only 1% of the professoriate at PWIs (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2010). For Black female doctoral students at these institutions it remains imperative to have an effective advising model, one that can enhance program satisfaction and success-as defined as degree completion-of Black female doctoral students.Review of Related LiteratureChallenges for Black Female Doctoral StudentsBlack female faculty and graduate students face a unique set of barriers directly related to their race and gender that can be detrimental to their success and vitality in academe (Benjamin, 1997; Evans, 2007; hooks, 1989; Mabokela, 2001). …",,2013,24,43,4,False,,432,1519166144,Maria Helena Santos,2071079828,Lígia Amâncio,7465517,H.

432,Gender and politics: The relevance of gender on judgements about the merit of candidates and the fairness of quotas,"Drawing on the conceptualization of meritocracy as an illusion, we argue that perceptions of merit and fairness of sex quotas in politics are influenced by gender ideology, specifically gender symbolical asymmetry, which equates men with individuals and the universal reference of 'person', and women with a sexed category. A total of 311 Portuguese participants read one of eight scenarios manipulating the sex and political competence of two candidates for an electoral list where only one would be selected. According to the experimental condition, either the female or the male candidate was presented as more competent or both candidates were presented as equally competent. In the control condition no such information was provided. Participants rated the merit of the selected candidate and the fairness of quotas. Results show that men take mostly only the candidates’ competence information into consideration. Reflecting gender symbolic asymmetry women were also influenced by the fact that the selected candidate was male or female. Results are discussed in the light of the gender symbolic asymmetry model.",,2013,45,6,0,True,,433,116348737,A. Rafi,14198783,D. Baunach,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

434,The Perfume. When the Applicant’s Odour Affects the Recruiter... or not: A Question of Determinability,"Various tools are used in recruitment, even if the validity of some of them, as the interview, is problematic. Indeed, during an interview a recruiter is affected, also without realizing it, by miscellaneous unwanted influences that may direct the evaluations. According to the “social determinability approach”, such non-conscious influences may affect more or less the person, according to the surrounding social situation. The present study is interested in the impact of the type of odour of an applicant according to the recruiter’s degree of “determinability”. It is hypothesized that these two factors do have consequences on the hiring decision and on the evaluation of the applicant, according to the social value of personality traits. Results show that the applicant has been judged more “useful” when wearing a masculine fragrance that is congruent with his gender and the recruitment situation. More particularly, he is more hired by “determinable” recruiters when his fragrance is typically masculine, while the fragrance does not influence the decisions of “non determinable” recruiters. So, when recruiters are “determinable”, their degree of permeability to situational influences increases. They then use any element of the context (here, the applicant’s fragrance) to judge the applicant and to hire him.",,2013,0,1,0,False,,435,114751125,Cynthie Marchal,40296894,C. Leys,72818941,P.

436,"Endorsement of sexist ideology in Taiwan and the United States: social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and deferential family norms.","Despite close relationships between men and women in daily lives, gender inequality is ubiquitous and often supported by sexist ideology. The understanding of potential bases of sexist ideology is thus important. According to Duckitt's dual-process model (2001), different worldviews may explain different types of sexist ideology. Individuals who hold a ""competitive world"" worldview tend to endorse group-based dominance. This lends itself to the endorsement of hostile sexism, because hostile sexism is an obvious form of male dominance. Conversely, individuals who hold a ""dangerous world"" worldview tend to adhere to social cohesion, collective security, and social traditions. This lends itself to the endorsement of benevolent sexism, because benevolent sexism values women who conform to gender norms. As predicted by Duckitt's model, research has shown that social dominance orientation, a general orientation towards the endorsement of group-based dominance, is closely associated with hostile sexism. Furthermore, right-wing authoritarianism, which measures adherence to social traditions, is closely associated with benevolent sexism. Due to the interdependent nature of gender relationships, the current research proposed that a relationship-based belief in hierarchy, deferential family norms, and norms depicting proper manners among family members should predict the endorsement of hostile and benevolent sexism, after controlling for social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism. As predicted, according to student samples collected in Taiwan and the US, the endorsement of deferential family norms predicted the endorsement of hostile sexism and of benevolent sexism, respectively. In addition, among men and women, social dominance orientation predicted hostile sexism more strongly (as opposed to benevolent sexism), whereas right-wing authoritarianism predicted benevolent sexism more strongly (as opposed to hostile sexism). Implications regarding relationship norms, social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and sexist ideology are discussed.",International Journal of Psychology,2013,25,11,1,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The current research proposed that a relationship-based belief in hierarchy, deferential family norms, and norms depicting proper manners among family members should predict the endorsement of hostile and benevolent sexism, after controlling for social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism.'}",437,117393498,Cheong-Yi Park,48415944,H.

437,Sexual harassment in Korean college classrooms: how self-construal and gender affect students' reporting behavior,"This article examines the reasons why women students may hesitate to report sexual harassment. The research draws on the notion of ‘self-construal’. Self-construal is a form of self-identification in social relationships, which in this case relates, in particular, to gender within cultural environments in Korea. For the purposes of this research, a survey was conducted with 298 Korean college students from 7 to 14 March 2006. The results showed that different types of self-construal had different influences on Korean college students' and their reporting of sexual harassment, whereas gender did not. Grounded in the theoretical framework of self-construal, people with independent self-construal were found to express their uncomfortable feelings and to report to the university counseling center, whereas people with interdependent self-construal did not. Furthermore, we found that women were more likely than men to directly express their opinions and report sexual harassment to the university counseling center. Men are also harassed by women colleagues or students but are often more reluctant than women to recognize their experiences as ‘sexual harassment’ because of the stereotype that men are the perpetrators of this behavior, not its victims, and because they fear ‘loss of face.’ It is necessary to engage not just with femininity but also with masculinity and the relationship between these constructs because they are both temporally and geographically contingent.",,2013,96,10,2,False,,438,5349766,J.

438,The subtle–blatant distinction of ethnic prejudice among ethnic majority chidren,"Research on ethnic prejudice among children is important for contemporary multicultural schools seeking to enhance communication among students from different ethnic groups and provide effective intercultural education. Current scientific discourse points to the appearance of new implicit forms of prejudice, witnessed in modern multicultural societies, while traditional explicit prejudice tends to decline. However, empirical studies concerning the blatant–subtle distinction of prejudice in children are scarce. This paper examines ethnic prejudice in 329 ethnic majority preadolescents (aged 10–13 years) attending 10 urban and rural schools in central Greece. Data were collected using questionnaires constructed on the basis of focus group discussions with children, in addition to sociometric tests. Findings support the subtle–blatant distinction of prejudice in children and indicate that although blatant prejudice expressed as personal rejection is indeed low, perceptions of ethnic minority groups as a ‘problem’ for school life, as well as subtle prejudice, are substantial. Ethnic minority children are less popular and stigmatizing behaviour is common. Intimacy with an ethnic minority classmate is associated with lower levels of blatant prejudice at the individual level but the other forms of prejudice are not affected.",,2013,55,9,0,False,,439,32038335,K.

441,Differential effects of female and male candidates on system justification: Can cracks in the glass ceiling foster complacency?,"Despite women's increasing representation in elected offices across a range of countries, women remain a minority of elected officials. Although greater gender equality in political leadership may be assumed to promote gender equality in other domains, the presence of female candidates might ironically facilitate attitudes associated with legitimizing gender inequality. Using experimental methods, we demonstrate that the presence of a female political candidate, relative to a male political candidate, leads to greater beliefs that the sociopolitical system is just (Experiment 1), greater legitimacy of the gender status hierarchy (Experiment 2), and greater implicit preference for stability (Experiment 3). Ironically, within a context in which women are generally underrepresented as political leaders, the increasing presence of women as political candidates might lead to stronger legitimization of the current sociopolitical system, potentially inhibiting social change.

442,Is the Belief in Meritocracy Palliative for Members of Low Status Groups? Evidence for a Benefit for Self-Esteem and Physical Health via Perceived Control.,"Consensually held ideologies may serve as the cultural ""glue"" that justifies hierarchical status differences in society (e.g. Augustinos, 1998). Yet to be effective these beliefs need to be embraced by low-status groups. Why would members of low-status groups endorse beliefs that justify their relative disadvantage? We propose that members of low-status groups in the United States may benefit from some system-justifying beliefs (such as the belief in meritocracy) to the extent that these beliefs emphasize the perception of control over future outcomes. In 2 studies, among women, lower-SES women, and women of color, we found a positive relationship between the belief in meritocracy and well-being (self-esteem and physical health) that was mediated by perceived control.

443,"Social psychological perspectives on the legitimation of social inequality: Past, present and future","This introductory article for the special issue entitled “Social Psychological Perspectives on the Legitimation of Social Inequality” reviews various theoretical frameworks applied to the study of this topic. Legitimation of social inequality occurs through individual-level, group-level, and system-level processes. In societies in which egalitarianism and fairness are core cultural values, legitimation permits differential treatment of people on the basis of their social group memberships while allowing people to maintain positive self-images, to reinforce group-based hierarchies and to justify a status quo that systematically benefits some individuals and groups more than others. In this article, we focus on three major theoretical perspectives in social psychology that have inspired most of the research featured in this special issue, and we offer a general overview of the articles to follow, expanding upon their connections to one another and to the theme of the issue. We highlight the promise of research on legitimation of social inequality not only for developing a deeper and more integrative theoretical understanding of intergroup relations but also for guiding interventions to achieve social equality in practice.

Compared with control targets, male leave requesters were viewed as higher on weak, feminine traits (e.g., weak and uncertain), and lower on agentic masculine traits (e.g., competitive and ambitious). Perceptions of weakness uniquely predicted greater risk for penalties (e.g., being demoted or downsized) and fully accounted for the effect of poor worker stigma on male leave requesters’ penalties. By contrast, the poor worker stigma and both agency and weakness perceptions contributed to their reward recommendations.

MethodsThis secondary analysis of existing data collected in two independent, cross-sectional surveys (the French GAZEL cohort and a representative sample of Tunisian women) compared both samples for six dimensions of the Women’s Health Questionnaire while taking into account social and demographic characteristics and menopause status with multivariate logistic models. ResultsComparison of 1,040 Tunisian women aged 45 to 64 years with 774 French women aged 48 to 53 years showed that Tunisian women had a significantly lower QoL than the French women in every dimension (low QoL for Tunisian vs French, odds ratio [95% CI]: somatic symptoms, 2.1 [1.6-2.7]; depressed mood, 3.6 [2.8-4.7]; anxiety, 2.4 [1.8-3.3]; vasomotor symptoms, 1.7 [1.3-2.3]). QoL was also lower for working-class women, but associations were weaker than for country (low QoL for working class vs middle class, odds ratio [95% CI]: somatic symptoms: 1.9 [1.5-2.4]; depressed mood, 1.5 [1.2-1.8]; anxiety, 1.8 [1.5-2.3]; vasomotor symptoms, 1.7 [1.4-2.2]). Associations between country and QoL were stronger in the working class than in the middle class.

Drawing on data from the National Survey of Religion and Family Life, which contains information on multiple sources of potential emotional support, we use latent class analysis to uncover four different anticipated support profiles, which are organized along two dimensions of variation: religiosity and breadth. We label these profiles religious, secular, broad, and limited. Our analyses demonstrate associations between these anticipated support profiles and a person's gender, family status, age, race, socioeconomic status, and religious involvement. For instance, we find that Catholics are more likely than non-Catholics to have secular rather than religious support profiles, and African Americans tend to have profiles that are either religious or limited. Finally, we show that these profiles have implications for well-being.

The results show that non-European ethnic minorities experience weaker labour market attachments relative to the native majority. Once employment is secured, however, there is no evident pattern of ethnic disadvantage in access to advantaged occupational positions.

460,Role of Womanism Perceived Sexist Events and Psychological Distress of Sexual Minority Women of Color : The Moderating,"Scholars have argued that much of the sexism literature has not acknowledged diversity among women, and they have called for more attention to the intersectionality of the multiple marginalized identities of sexual minority women of color (WOC) in particular. With a sample of 182 sexual minority WOC, we examined (a) the links between perceived lifetime and recent sexist events and psychological distress and (b) the potential moderating role in these relations of womanism (a perspective of feminism that recognizes the roles of both gender and race/ethnicity in the lives of WOC). Findings from our Internet survey indicated that lifetime and recent sexism were related significantly and positively to psychological distress. Womanism was also associated positively with both forms of sexism and psychological distress. In partial support of study hypotheses, womanism moderated the relationship between perceived lifetime sexist events, but not recent sexist events, and psychological distress. More specifically, the link between lifetime sexist events and psychological distress was significant and positive for sexual minority WOC with lower levels of womanism and not significant for those with higher levels of womanism. With regard to practice implications, assessing and exploring sexist events, placing these experiences in a larger sociocultural context of oppression, connecting with the legacy of social activism of marginalized groups, and encouraging supportive networks may diminish distress.",,2013,61,0,0,False,,461,46679258,Michael S.

461,"Act Your ( Old ) Age : Prescriptive , Ageist Biases Over Succession , Consumption , and Identity","Perspectives on ageism have focused on descriptive stereotypes concerning what older people allegedly are. By contrast, we introduce prescriptive stereotypes that attempt to control how older people should be: encouraging active Succession of envied resources, preventing passive Consumption of shared resources, and avoidance of symbolic, ingroup identity resources. Six studies test these domains, utilizing vignette experiments and simulated behavioral interactions. Across studies, younger (compared with middle-aged and older) raters most resented elder violators of prescriptive stereotypes. Moreover, these younger participants were most polarized toward older targets (compared with middle-aged and younger analogues) – rewarding elders most for prescription adherences and punishing them most for violations. Taken together, these findings offer a novel approach to ageist prescriptions, which disproportionately target older people, are most endorsed by younger people, and suggest how elders shift from receiving the default prejudice of pity to either prescriptive resentment or reward.",,2015,69,41,5,False,,462,116661214,Sara M.

462,Promiscuous (use of) feminist methodologies: the dirty theory and messy practice of educational research beyond gender,"This editor’s introduction narrates how we as researchers trained in qualitative and feminist methodology came to read our own work as promiscuous and interpret the terms “feminist” and “feminism” through both practice and theory. It marks the circulation of the term “promiscuous feminist methodology” and registers its salience for educational researchers who risk blundering feminist theories and methodologies in chaotic and unbridled ways. The use of the phrase “promiscuous feminist” to describe methodology is not merely an attention-seeking oxymoron, though we hope that its irony is not lost. The sexism embedded in language is what makes the notion of “feminists gone wild” tantalizing, though what we put forth is how the messy practice of inquiry transgresses any imposed boundaries or assumptions about what counts as research and feminism. Because the theories we put to work “get dirty” as they are contaminated and re-appropriated by other ways of thinking and doing through (con)texts of messy practices, promiscuous feminist methodologies are always in-the-making and already ahead of what we think they are. Set in motion by anxieties, disappointments, and frustrations of feeling out of place in the academy and in feminism, we examine our personal, academic, and political engagement with these contradictions that became the springboard for this special issue.",,2013,75,40,2,False,,463,114674533,L.

While men were also criminalised for good order offences, women suffered a double punishment.

464,Sterilizing society: social order and policing sex work in Taiwan,"This article utilizes Michel Foucault's view of state racism to analyze the criminalization of sex workers in Taiwan. To explore the political significance underlying the term “sex work” for anti-prostitution activists, we must historically situate their discourses and their impact on legal control in the late 1980s women's movements. Their efforts to reform society followed from their commitment to child protection and from their long-standing goal of eliminating women's sexuality through motherhood. An uphill battle, marshaled chiefly by the amendment of the Youth Welfare Act in 1988 and the legislation of CYSTPA in 1995, it became more furious in its assault on sex workers. By 2009, whereas those anti-prostitution activists had promoted anti-human trafficking provisions to protect victims under the age of 18, such provisions had in reality become mechanisms for arresting anyone related with the sex industry. This means that what was put forward as a principle for the integration of society and its visible order was based on sexual inequality. Contrasting the strategies and rhetoric of regulating sex workers in Taiwan, what is really necessary is to bring the cultural dynamics behind policies into a sharper view of state racism.",,2013,31,1,0,False,,465,143994852,Elspeth J.

Results confirm that slurs are generally judged as being more insulting when directed towards females than towards males. In comparison, differences in sex of sender were small. When directed towards females, slurs referring to ""being loose"" were rated as the most insulting. For both target sexes, remarks referring to homosexuality and physical unattractiveness were among those rated as the most insulting. Least insulting were slurs referring to unethical acts, lack of intelligence and cowardliness. A sex of respondent effect was found, suggesting that women rated slurs generally more insulting than men.

Additionally, identity performance is negotiated in unique and sometimes contradictory ways.

483,Digital Manipulation of Images of Models' Appearance in Advertising: Strategies for Action Through Law and Corporate Social Responsibility Incentives to Protect Public Health,"Context: Widespread digital retouching of advertising imagery in the fashion, beauty, and other consumer industries promotes unrealistic beauty standards that have harmful effects on public health. In particular, exposure to misleading beauty imagery is linked with greater body dissatisfaction, worse mood, poorer self-esteem, and increased risk for disordered eating behaviors. Moreover, given the social, psychological, medical, and economic burden of eating disorders, there is an urgent need to address environmental risk factors and to scale up prevention efforts by increasing the regulation of digitally altered advertising imagery. Methods: This manuscript summarizes the health research literature linking digital retouching of advertising to increased risk of eating disorders, disordered weight and appearance control behaviors, and body dissatisfaction in consumers, followed by a review of global policy initiatives designed to regulate digital retouching to reduce health harms to consumers. Next, we turn to the US legal context, reporting on findings generated through legal research via Westlaw and LexisNexis, congressional records, federal agency websites, law review articles, and Supreme Court opinions, in addition to consulting legal experts on both tax law and the First Amendment, to evaluate the viability of various policy initiatives proposed to strengthen regulation on digital retouching in the United States. Findings: Influencing advertising practices via tax incentives combined with corporate social responsibility initiatives may be the most constitutionally feasible options for the US legal context to reduce the use of digitally alternated images of models' bodies in advertising.

This study found that the terms “empathy” and “care” are infrequently applied to an engineering context, although like-terms such as “users’ needs” and “compassion” are present in the literature. Focus group participants discussed several ways through which engineering is already an empathetic/caring discipline, such as in the prominence of collegial collaboration or when considering the importance of the societal issues engineers seek to solve. It was suggested that if engineers were to become more empathetic and caring diversity may increase and solving people’s problems would become more prudent. Using the literature review and thematical analysis as way points, implications for the education of engineers and engineering as a profession are discussed. Overall, promoting the constructs of empathy and care in engineering education was considered a positive undertaking with numerous implications. Introduction/Background Empathy is one of the most powerful emotions, yet until recently society and science have ignored “the most valuable resource in our world”. 1 The last ten years have seen an increase of research articles and popular books on the topic of empathy. For example, titles such as “Mirroring People: The Science of Empathy and How We Connect with Others” 2 and “The Social Neuroscience of Empathy” 3 , both published in 2009, represent two recent examples of the growing body of the newly emerging “science of empathy”. By a cursory and unsystematic review of the literature (this paper will present a much more thorough review), the lack of research on the connection between engineering (along with other technical/scientific fields) and empathy/care is glaring. This comes as a surprise because empathetic design is considered the most comprehensive form of human-centered design 4 and empathic communication skills are postulated to lead to more personal connection to stakeholders: 5 As the world becomes more integrated culturally and environmentally, engineers have to adapt to challenges with responsible innovations that embrace ethical and ecological contexts. Traditionally, engineering as a profession has focused primarily on a set of technical skills, such as problem solving, design, and modeling. It is undeniable that these skills are core and important. However, the target attributes for future engineering graduates, such as featured in the National Academy of Engineering’s (NAE) “Engineer of 2020”, include specific character qualities and affective dispositions as well, wherein promoting traits such as empathy and care is sometimes referenced as holistic engineering education. 6 The NAE now emphasizes the need to promote engineering “habits of mind”, which include systems thinking, creativity, optimism, collaboration, communication, and attention to ethical considerations. 7 These “habits of mind” qualities would shift perceptions of engineers from individuals who are solely object-oriented workers to individuals who have a strong work ethic (in collaborations and communications), are ethically responsible (globally, socially, intellectually, and technologically), are able to adapt to new trends, are innovative, and are entrepreneurial. Research in other domains such as medicine and nursing found that traits which underlie many of the attributes for the NAE’s idealized “Engineer of 2020” (as similarly desired for the medical profession) are empathy and care. 8 Despite NAE’s initiatives, there is a lack of research and curricula on the development of habits of mind, including empathy and care, in engineering education. Although other disciplines incorporate empathy and care as part of long standing core values and learning outcomes, little of this expertise has made its way into engineering and engineering education. Historically, the engineer has had a masculine image, 9 which is associated with keeping emotions to oneself or actively hiding feelings in order to be perceived as objective, impartial, analytical, and not weak. 10 Thus, it is not surprising that when this conversation about empathy and care’s relationship to engineering arises, the engineer might say, “Shhh” as these terms traditionally do not mesh with the dominant image of engineering. The research questions guiding this study are as follows: 1. How, and to what extent, are terms associated with empathy and care being used within engineering literature, and to what aspects of engineering are these terms most frequently related? 2. How are empathy and care perceived to be present within the engineering profession according to the views of engineering faculty representatives and non-engineering faculty hailing from domains traditionally perceived to be empathetic and caring? 3. How are empathy/care currently incorporated into engineering education and are there areas where they may be further incorporated? We will begin by introducing our theoretical framework, summarizing prior research and existing literature before presenting our study. We will then describe the methodological framework, methods of data collection and analysis, and results. Finally, we will conclude by discussing implications and take-away messages for engineering education. Theoretical Framework There are no single universal definitions of empathy or care, nor is there only one means of teaching these constructs. One widely accepted definition of empathy presented by Berger was being able to understand the experience of others. 11 In turn, one shared understanding of caring, as defined by Mayeroff, is helping others grow in their unique way and at their own pace. 12 While empathy and care are often considered to be related (e.g. empathy leads to caring, caring leads to empathy, one trait is a component of the other), one unanimous consensus on how they are related is non-existent. Empathy is both a cognitive and an affective process. It involves a person’s perceptions, thoughts, and feelings and how those concepts become manifested into a deeper understanding of others. Generally, empathy is considered an internal process that may or may not lead to an external expression of conveyed understanding. Care is a similar complex construct, involving both feelings and actions. It is a concept that dwells in intentions and actions of people who are pursuing the wellbeing of something, whether it is another person, the environment, the general public, the goals of a company, the values of stakeholders, or their own personal interests. Given the wide variety of definitions for care, no two individuals are likely to understand the concept exactly the same. Analyzing the constructs of empathy and care together allows researchers to gain insight into which specific elements of these broad concepts are the most significant to the world of engineering. It has been posited that empathy leads to care, care leads to empathy, and even that the two constructs are in fact inseparable, 13 we posit that situated together and within an engineering context, empathy will instill within engineers an affective disposition, whereas care will influence engineers to act in a positive manner. An empathetic engineer will understand which actions are deemed positive to others and a caring engineer will ensure that their engineering decisions have long-term positive effects. This project is grounded in two theoretical assumptions stemming from Conversation Theory. 14 First, in order to conduct interdisciplinary work and integrate conceptions from different fields of inquiry, a common language needs to be established. Second, the establishment of a common language is not a static process or the development of a thesaurus; common language is a continued and dynamic process of negotiation, in which conversations between participants lead to knowledge emergence and shared understandings. Conversations are not merely describing an existing reality: conversations can be understood as practices “that systematically form the objects of which they speak”. 15 Prior Research and Literature Review This paper is a comprehensive extension to a previous literature review that examined how empathy and care are conceptualized in standards and curriculum of fields that are traditionally perceived to be empathetic and caring, fields that “have mastered the integration of teaching of empathy and caring into their regular curricula”. 13 The previous literature review also examined how the terms “empathy” and “care” were being used within engineering literature. In the previous study, we found 22 empathy and 16 care-related engineering papers explicitly using these terms. Nearly half of these (14 and 7) papers were within the domain of Engineering Education. While empathy and care have been incorporated into many professional standards, such as counseling and nursing, rarely is this the case in engineering. One exception was the American Society of Civil Engineers’ “Vision for the Civil Engineer in 2025”, which suggested that the future civil engineer should be able to “[l]ead by formulating and articulating environmental infrastructure and other improvements and build consensus by practicing inclusiveness, empathy [emphasis added], compassion, persuasiveness, patience, and critical thinking”. 16 Phase",,2012,74,4,0,False,,492,66913182,Barbara LeMaster,70820278,Karen Quintiliani,39055388,Allison Hunt,,,,,,,Sociology,

493,"A longitudinal analysis of Hispanic youth acculturation and cigarette smoking: the roles of gender, culture, family, and discrimination.","INTRODUCTION
Risk for smoking initiation increases as Hispanic youth acculturate to U.S. society, and this association seems to be stronger for Hispanic girls than boys. To better understand the influence of culture, family, and everyday discrimination on cigarette smoking, we tested a process-oriented model of acculturation and cigarette smoking.


METHODS
Data came from Project RED (Reteniendo y Entendiendo Diversidad para Salud), which included 1,436 Hispanic students (54% girls) from Southern California. We used data from 9th to 11th grade (85% were 14 years old, and 86% were U.S. born) to test the influence of acculturation-related experiences on smoking over time.


RESULTS
Multigroup structural equation analysis suggested that acculturation was associated with increased familismo and lower traditional gender roles, and enculturation was linked more with familismo and respeto. Familismo, respeto, and traditional gender roles were linked with lower family conflict and increased family cohesion, and these links were stronger for girls. Familismo and respeto were further associated with lower discrimination. Conversely, fatalismo was linked with worse family functioning (especially for boys) and increased discrimination in both the groups. Discrimination was the only predictor of smoking for boys and girls.


CONCLUSIONS
In all, the results of the current study indicate that reducing discrimination and helping youth cope with discrimination may prevent or reduce smoking in Hispanic boys and girls. This may be achieved by promoting familismo and respeto and by discouraging fatalistic beliefs.",Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2013,50,47,2,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results of the current study indicate that reducing discrimination and helping youth cope with discrimination may prevent or reduce smoking in Hispanic boys and girls by promoting familismo and respeto and by discouraging fatalistic beliefs.'}",494,144305927,B.

494,A Corpus-based Investigation of Gender Stereotyping and Linguistic Sexism in Qatari Primary School Science Textbooks,"The content of textbooks that do not show gender equality can act as a conduit for the indoctrination of sexism and sex role conformity among primary students since they are too young to understand the hidden bias embedded. This corpus-based study is part of a bigger study that investigated the occurrence of gender stereotyping and linguistic sexism in the corpus of Qatari primary school science textbooks (Grades 1 to 6). The research design of this study paired the Corpus Lingusitics Approach with Critical Discourse Analysis, which is an innovative endeavour in textbook analysis not much capitalised by researchers in the area. This paper reports the findings of the quantitative textbook analysis. The findings revealed the existence of a large number of neutral gender roles which seem to indicate that the textbook writers were making a conscious effort to promote gender equality. However, further analysis reveals that there is indeed a masculine bias in the science textbooks in that the language used often reinforced male actors as the natural standard. Although in the public sphere females were significantly depicted, their positions are less varied and they occurred less frequently than the males. Males are portrayed as successful and powerful in the social domain and occupy higher positions in society. The second-place status of females is still deeply rooted in the textbooks investigated, and this may negatively impact on the effort to accentuate the active roles of Qatari females in the field of science.",,2013,53,2,0,False,,495,6372321,A.

However, though prioritized as subjects for prevention, they are also often denied sexual agency. Purpose This article reports the results of a study conducted to examine young Latino/a participants' perspectives on communicating and learning about sexuality in school and family settings. Methods A Photovoice project was conducted with 20 Latino/a high school students. Each participant received a digital camera to take photos for 2 discussion sessions. Participants discussed select photos in relation to self-generated topics. Results One overarching theme, double standards in expectations about sexual communication, and 2 related subthemes, contrasting gender expectations in sexual desire and pleasure and confirming ideologies in sexual taboos and disconnections, emerged during discussions. Discussion The persistence of a double standard placing responsibility for sexual protection on young women indicates a need to design health education programs centered on a critical examination of gendered and sexual expectations.

This research explored the types of sexual exploitation that practitioners had worked with in the preceding year and Local Safeguarding Children Boards' responses to young people's sexual exploitation. The findings indicate that there may be several models of sexual exploitation operating simultaneously in any particular area, and the article therefore suggests that the discourse on young people's sexual exploitation that has dominated policy and practice for more than a decade in the UK requires reconsideration to account for the complex forms of sexual exploitation young people experience in the 21st century. The paper suggests that, in order to provide young people with the most appropriate support, practice responses need to be developed from the concrete conditions in which young people are subject to sexual exploitation, rather than applying abstract 'models' that fail to capture the lived experience of the young people concerned.

Three hundred undergraduate participants read a vignette describing a JFP and responded to a series of measures. Results supported a causal pathway whereby stronger perceiver sexism predicted stronger negative affective evaluations of, and weaker empathic reactions toward, the JFP. Stronger negative affective evaluations and weaker empathic reactions, in turn, predicted stronger culpability attributions toward the JFP. Also, participants who were provided information about the JFP's extensive victimisation history and coercion into the trade, relative to participants who were not provided this information, attributed lesser culpability to the JFP. Finally, stronger culpability attributions toward the JFP related to weaker recommendations of restorative justice (i.e. counselling/mental health services for the JFP) and stronger recommendations of retributive justice (i.e. incarceration for the JFP). Study implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

500,Synergistic Effects of Expectancy and Value on Homework Engagement: The Case for a Within-Person Perspective,"Historically, expectancy–value models of motivation assumed a synergistic relation between expectancy and value: motivation is high only when both expectancy and value are high. Motivational processes were studied from a within-person perspective, with expectancies and values being assessed or experimentally manipulated across multiple domains and the focus being placed on intraindividual differences. In contrast, contemporary expectancy–value models in educational psychology concentrate almost exclusively on linear effects of expectancy and value on motivational outcomes, with a focus on between-person differences. Recent advances in latent variable methodology allow both issues to be addressed in observational studies. Using the expectancy–value model of homework motivation as a theoretical framework, this study estimated multilevel structural equation models with latent interactions in a sample of 511 secondary school students and found synergistic effects between domain-specific homework expectancy and homework value in predicting homework engagement in 6 subjects. This approach not only brings the “×” back into expectancy–value theory but also reestablishes the within-person perspective as the appropriate level of analysis for latent expectancy–value models.",Multivariate Behavioral Research,2013,111,48,6,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study estimated multilevel structural equation models with latent interactions in a sample of 511 secondary school students and found synergistic effects between domain-specific homework expectancy and homework value in predicting homework engagement in 6 subjects.'}",501,2115253866,Carwyn Jones,116032270,Lisa Edwards,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

More specifically, it pays heed to the work that feminist theologians have done to expose the patriarchal heart of many traditional Christian eschatological imaginings. Alongside this, it also charts an appreciation of alternative ideas offered by feminist theologians: primarily that of a sympathetic God who exercises power-in-relationship with creation in the here and now. However, in an attempt to both synthesize and add to these two theological fields, I suggest that eschatology can embrace both the sympathetic God-with-creation, and the finally redemptive God-for-creation.

507,Girls’ “New Femininity” Refusals and “Good Girl” Recuperations in Soap Talk,"The “new femininities” produced in postfeminist media confront girls with complex and challenging subjectivities that reach into the spaces where girls engage in their own productions of self. Feminist scholarship has interrogated and critiqued the “girl” produced in postfeminist popular culture texts, highlighting her internal contradictions and often problematic re/production within the heterosexual matrix. Yet, despite an intensified focus on girls featured in popular culture, the ways that girls themselves make sense of the “girl” in contemporary femininity texts has been relatively neglected. Viewing girls' sense-making of femininity in popular culture texts as crucial in the process of their subjectivity or self-production, in this paper we examine pre-teen girls' negotiations of femininity through their talk about Scarlett, a main teen girl character in a New Zealand soap drama. Our analyses and discussion focus on girls' management of the contradictory and regulatory productions of femininity in the text, in particular the often classed conditions under which girls recuperate the “good girl” discourse to refuse the regulatory femininities inside the heterosexual matrix. We suggest that an absence of empowering discourses outside of postfeminism's sexual empowerment limits girls' resources for critiquing and challenging regulatory femininities, “new” and “traditional.”",,2013,57,16,1,False,,508,117924972,Noelle J.

An experimental study was carried out with 108 Afghan police officers who took part in a training course at the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan (NTM-A) bases in Herat and Kandahar. Participants read an extract of a police intervention for an IPV case. They were faced with honor-related attitudes and possible actions to be taken to help victims and arrest perpetrators. In the experimental condition, in the questionnaire provided to police officers, there was reference to the victim admitting to an affair with another man. No such reference was present in the control condition. Results showed that admitting an infidelity produced more lenient attitudes toward the violence against the woman, which in turn reduced police officers’ intention to intervene by arresting the man and providing support to the victim.

512,Maternal body work: How women managers and professionals negotiate pregnancy and new motherhood at work,"This article builds on the theorizing of body work through introducing a new concept: ‘maternal body work’. In so doing, it shows how progress towards a feminist politics of motherhood within organizations remains limited. Despite decades of feminist scholarship, dissonances remain between the private worlds of reproduction and public worlds of organization. With regard to this limited progress, the article reveals how, among a sample of 27 mothers (all professionally and managerially employed in the UK), 22 felt marginalized and undervalued at work, experiencing the borders between maternity and organization as unmalleable.

513,The politics of experience: A discursive psychology approach to understanding different accounts of sexism in the workplace,"Researching sexism is not only a controversial undertaking, but one that is rendered problematic due to the fact that many individuals are reluctant to name certain experiences or practices as ‘sexist’. In this article, I use a discursive psychology approach to transcend arguments as to whether certain experiences and practices should be understood as sexist, focusing instead on how, in the context of a research ‘conversation’, participants attempt to warrant their own interpretations of these processes. Using data from research conversations held with two policewomen, who present very different accounts of sexism, I argue that social facts, like sexism, possess an inherent interpretive duality: they can be understood, simultaneously, to be both objective and subjective experiences. The study illustrates that the resolution of competing reality claims (e.g. is sexism a ‘fact’ or is it ‘in the eye of the beholder’) depends upon the processes through which particular versions of reality acquire authority. This essentially political process is, I argue, critical for understanding the reproduction, resilience and endurance of social facts such as sexism.",,2013,89,21,6,False,,514,46739617,S.

Concerns that girls are asked to self-sexualize at younger and younger ages have led to an examination of the influence of media on girls. The current study attempts to explore public views on the ‘self-sexualization’ of a Disney pop star, Miley Cyrus, in what was called a ‘pole dance’ by the media. This performance at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards stirred considerable debate in the news and on public websites. The current analysis examines website responses of 13 websites through a qualitative, thematic analysis of over 500 individual responses. Analysis of internet comments revealed themes of agency and innocence in adolescent female sexuality as well as the function of these themes in US culture. The dominant themes are discussed in light of the largely absent gendered analysis of the performance and its significance.",,2013,65,24,1,False,,515,145636164,Sarah Riley,116711159,C.

515,Feminism versus femininity? Exploring feminist dilemmas through cooperative inquiry research,"This article analyses the findings from a cooperative inquiry study with seven feminist identified women based in the UK. It explores the tensions participants experienced in negotiating their feminist identification on the one hand and engagements in normative beauty practices on the other. A discourse analysis of participants’ talk identified an ideological dilemma of ‘feminism versus femininity’, a contemporary re-working of long-standing constructions of feminism and femininity as mutually exclusive. In exploring how this dilemma was negotiated, the article supports existing arguments that femininity is increasingly constructed as a bodily practice. The article also examines the consequences of employing the feminist versus femininity dilemma which included the use of anti-feminist and homophobic constructions. Strategies to resist the dilemma involved postfeminist individual choice arguments or refusal to participate in practices that were critiqued. These strategies were individualist, only partially successful, and failed to engage with the classed and racialised aspects of contemporary beauty ideals.",,2013,54,30,3,False,,516,144501236,R.

521,The Value of Outside Support for Male and Female Politicians Involved in a Political Sex Scandal,"ABSTRACT This research examined how third party statements impact the evaluation of male and female politicians caught in a scandal (i.e., extramarital affair). Governor's sex was crossed with three types of support statements: third party supportive (TPS), third party non-supportive (TPNS), and governor self-supportive (GSS). In Experiment 1, a female politician was evaluated more positively than a male politician. The TPS and the GSS conditions were both evaluated more positively than the TPNS condition. Experiment 2's design was similar to Experiment 1's, except it involved multiple affairs. In Experiment 2, participants used the third party's statements as an information source and thus reduced their use of gender stereotypes in the TPS and TPNS conditions compared to the GSS condition. We also found that male respondents gave more negative evaluations of the female governor than female respondents.

524,Inhabiting the contradictions: Hypersexual femininity and the culture of intoxication among young women in the UK,"This paper contributes to debates on post-feminism and the constitution of contemporary femininity via an exploration of young women’s alcohol consumption and their involvement in normative drinking cultures. We view femininity as a profoundly contradictory and dilemmatic space which appears almost impossible for girls or young women to inhabit. The juxtaposition of hyper-sexual femininity and the culture of intoxication produces a particularly difficult set of dilemmas for young women. They are exhorted to be sassy and independent – but not feminist; to be ‘up for it’ and to drink and get drunk alongside young men – but not to ‘drink like men’. They are also called on to look and act as agentically sexy within a pornified night-time economy, but to distance themselves from the troubling figure of the ‘drunken slut’. Referring to recent research on young women’s alcohol consumption and our own study on young adults’ involvement in the culture of intoxication in the UK, we consider the ways in which young women manage to inhabit this terrain, and the implications for contemporary feminism and safer drinking initiatives.",,2013,122,153,14,True,,525,4734418,Geeta Nanda,3887810,S.

525,THE INFLUENCE OF GENDER ATTITUDES ON CONTRACEPTIVE USE IN TANZANIA: NEW EVIDENCE USING HUSBANDS' AND WIVES' SURVEY DATA,"Summary This paper explores the hypothesis that gender attitude scales (which measure the degree of equity in gender attitudes) are associated with contraceptive use. Four hundred male and female respondents (200 couples) were interviewed using a pre-tested, structured questionnaire. Analyses included comparisons of means and prevalence rates on gender equity indicators, other related factors and socio-demographic characteristics; t-tests to compare mean scores on each gender scale for wives and husbands to identify any significant differences; chi-squared tests to compare associations between individual attributes, attitudes and contraceptive use; and multivariate logistic regression to examine associations between each gender scale and contraceptive use. The findings revealed that, on average, wives endorsed more inequitable gender attitudes compared with husbands on all gender attitude scales. For wives, more equitable gender attitudes were positively associated with contraceptive use. For husbands, the role of gender attitudes had no significant association with wives' reported contraceptive use. Family planning programmes that aim to challenge inegalitarian gender norms should not overlook women in their efforts since both men and women often accept and support inequality in a social system and, in some cases, it may be women's gender attitudes that most influence family planning decisions.",Journal of Biosocial Science,2013,45,54,1,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""The findings revealed that, on average, wives endorsed more inequitable gender attitudes compared with husbands on all gender attitude scales, and it may be women's gender attitudes that most influence family planning decisions.""}",526,1413017499,Antoni Rubí-Barceló,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,

An associative procedure was used to expose participants to stereotypical vs. counterstereotypical gender roles, and a word categorization task with stereotypically feminine communal/warmth and stereotypically masculine agentic/competence trait words measured participants’ automatic responses. Results show that women exposed to traditional roles reverse the activation of gender stereotypes. That is, they activated competence/agency faster for female primes and warmth/communion faster for male primes in a subsequent task. The implicit stereotype reversal was predicted by participants’ endorsement of positive attitudes toward affirmative action policies.

The data analysis used χ2 for single comparisons but also multivariate analyses as between-class analysis and the Monte Carlo test to differentiate samples. The difference in the answers from students of the two countries is strongly significant, Estonian students’ answers being more innatist and linked with more intolerant attitudes than French ones, although in both cases the majority is tolerant. For each country, very few factors differentiate students: only gender in France for the question on sexism and schools in Estonia.

533,Gender role stereotype and poor working condition pose obstacles for female doctors to stay in full-time employment: alumnae survey from two private medical schools in Japan.,"The shortage of physicians has become a serious problem in Japan. It has been pointed out that an increase in the number of female doctors may contribute to the aggravation of this shortage because it is known that women work fewer hours than male doctors. Here, we investigated how many female doctors had ever resigned from a full-time position, and elucidated the reasons why female doctors find it difficult to stay in full-time employment. An alumnae survey of 2 private medical schools was conducted in 2007. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to 1423 graduates and 711 responded with informed consent (response rate, 50%; mean age, 39 years). Overall, 55% of the respondents had previously resigned from full-time employment, of which 90% resigned within 10 years of graduating from medical school. The difficulty in balancing work, childbirth and child rearing (45%) were the top 2 reasons for resignation, followed by physical problems (12%) and long working hours (8%). Among those who resigned, only 33% returned to full-time employment. Women who had at least 1 child were only 30% of those who had never resigned and 84% of those who had previously resigned. The majority of study subjects, regardless of experience of resignation (88%), agreed that women should continue to work even after childbirth.

535,The impact of sex ratio and economic status on local birth rates,"Human mating and reproductive behaviour can vary depending on various mechanisms, including the local sex ratio. Previous research shows that as sex ratios become female-biased, women from economically deprived areas are less likely to delay reproductive opportunities to wait for a high-investing mate but instead begin their reproductive careers sooner. Here, we show that the local sex ratio also has an impact on female fertility schedules. At young ages, a female-biased ratio is associated with higher birth rates in the poorest areas, whereas the opposite is true for the richest areas. At older ages, a female-biased ratio is associated with higher birth rates in the richest, but not the poorest areas. These patterns suggest that female–female competition encourages poorer women to adopt a fast life-history strategy and give birth early, and richer women to adopt a slow life-history strategy and delay reproduction.",Biology Letters,2013,23,30,1,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is shown that the local sex ratio also has an impact on female fertility schedules, and at young ages, a female-biased ratio is associated with higher birth rates in the poorest areas, whereas the opposite is true for the richest areas.'}",536,98278392,S.

The paper seeks to answer the following questions: (1) How does the migration behavior of married and cohabitating men and women differ from that of individuals who live alone? (2) What factors influence family migration? (3) Are there gender-specific differences in the factors that influence migration? Hypotheses are derived from theories of gender roles, household economics, and bargaining to investigate the migration of individuals and families. Data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study covering the period 1992 to 2007 are analyzed using logistic hierarchical regression models. The results show that the male partner's education level is the most important determinant of migration, whereas the female partner's education is of secondary importance. The results generally support the predictions of gender role theory. Despite their egalitarian views and socialization in a socialist country, couples from East Germany exhibit a traditional orientation toward gender roles when making migration decisions.",,2013,52,2,0,False,,537,9529851,S.

These two sites form powerful and contrasting creative contexts, yet they are also connected in that they creatively modify cultural and physical landscapes. Taking the affective turn as the basis of the discussion, I explore ways in which tactility and touch intersect with everyday creativity to provide meaning and self-identity but also affective relationships with objects. Thus, the contribution of this paper develops a neglected area of affect and its relation to consumer cultures, especially cultures of making and collecting that constitute experience of forgotten pasts in organization studies.

544,A multidisciplinary survey on discrimination analysis,"Abstract The collection and analysis of observational and experimental data represent the main tools for assessing the presence, the extent, the nature, and the trend of discrimination phenomena. Data analysis techniques have been proposed in the last 50 years in the economic, legal, statistical, and, recently, in the data mining literature. This is not surprising, since discrimination analysis is a multidisciplinary problem, involving sociological causes, legal argumentations, economic models, statistical techniques, and computational issues. The objective of this survey is to provide a guidance and a glue for researchers and anti-discrimination data analysts on concepts, problems, application areas, datasets, methods, and approaches from a multidisciplinary perspective.

546,Pediatric Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Current Concepts Review,"Objective: We present a review of revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in pediatric patients, discussing risk factors for rerupture, physical examination and imaging, treatment principles and surgical techniques, postoperative rehabilitation, and clinical outcomes. Data Sources: PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were queried for relevant articles about revision ACL topics. All types of manuscripts, including clinical studies, basic science studies, case series, current concepts reviews, and systematic reviews were analyzed for relevant information. Current concepts on risk factors for rerupture, physical examination and imaging, treatment principles and surgical techniques, postoperative rehabilitation, and clinical outcomes were synthesized. Main Results: Surgical treatment should be individualized, and the graft type, fixation devices, tunnel placement, and complementary procedures (eg, extra-articular tenodesis) should be tailored to the patient's needs and previous surgeries. Rehabilitation programs should also be centered around eccentric strengthening, isometric quadriceps strengthening, active flexion range of motion of the knee, and an emphasis on closed chain exercises. Despite adherence to strict surgical and postoperative rehabilitation principles, graft refailure rate is high, and return to sports rate is low. Conclusion: Rerupture of the ACL in the pediatric population is a challenging complication that requires special attention. Diagnostic evaluation of repeat ACL ruptures is similar to primary injuries. Although outcomes after revision ACL reconstruction are expectedly worse than after primary reconstruction, athletes do return to sport after proper rehabilitation. Further research is needed to continue to improve outcomes in this high-risk population, aimed at continued knee stability, graft survivorship, and improved quality of life.",Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine,2021,83,0,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Rerupture of the ACL in the pediatric population is a challenging complication that requires special attention, and outcomes after revision ACL reconstruction are expectedly worse than after primary reconstruction, athletes do return to sport after proper rehabilitation.'}",547,1420053690,J.

547,The Boy's Forum: An Evaluation of a Brief Intervention to Empower Middle-School Urban Boys,"Programs for middle-school boys are needed because data suggests that young adolescent males have problems as they grow and develop. Few gender role interventions for boys have been evaluated or published in the professional literature. Conceptual justification for boy's programs is given using psychosocial theory, gender role transitions, multicultural aspects of masculinity, and positive/healthy masculinity. A short term, inexpensive intervention, “The Boy's Forum,” was implemented for middle-school boys who were predominately Hispanic and African American. The Boy's Forum explained the hazards of growing up male (Goldberg, 1977) but also emphasized positive masculinity through empowerment, emotional awareness, and personal problem solving. The use of media, group discussions, empowerment themes, and adult self-disclosure to promote boy's psychosocial growth are described. Evaluation of the program occurred before the program, immediately after the program and three weeks later. Results indicate that a majority of boys attending the Boy's Forum reported that the programming positively affected their thinking, feelings, and to a lesser extent their behaviors over a three-week period. Limitations of the evaluation of this program, recommendations for future research, and the need for future curricular development for boys are discussed.",,2013,23,15,2,False,,548,144249989,M.

Results from two focus groups show that teenagers do not problematize the link between violence and desire implied by the storyline. Girls express a consensual admiration towards female characters with post-feminist traits and also show their desire to experience the main female character’s love story, which reflects traditional femininity. In both cases, suffering and sacrifices for love’s sake are justified; furthermore, men who are tough yet sweet are considered extremely attractive. Boys seem to be more reluctant to enter into and tolerate troubled relationships. They try to distance themselves from the narrative of the series, mocking the main male character.

553,"“My Husband, My Hero”: Selling the Political Spouses in the 2010 General Election","In spite of a record number of female parliamentary candidates, the 2010 general election campaign became notable for the intensity of coverage given to the female spouses of the three main party leaders. We find that this resulted from a combination of party communication strategy, established media discourses, and the agency and visibility of the wives themselves. First, Labour and the Conservatives were the most prominent in integrating their leaders' wives into their campaigns, often to counter the less marketable qualities of the leaders themselves. Second, while mainstream media outlets—particularly newspapers—sought to cover all three women, they did so drawing upon established gender-based conventions, focussing on the wives' physical appearance and apparent dedication to their husbands. Third, while the wife of the Liberal Democrat leader opted for limited and strategic contact with media, the wives of the Conservative and Labour leaders exploited a range of new media platforms, combining official party websites, personal blogs, and webcasts. We argue that any assessment of the role of the spouses of party leaders has to look at media-driven priorities only alongside the various strategies open to parties and individuals in managing media activities. We also suggest that there is scope to use the coverage of leaders' spouses to explore the development, limits, and gender politics of any shift toward presidentialism.",,2013,48,16,0,True,,554,12117859,M.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of gender violence legislation on the incidence of sexism and gender bias in advertisements published in four countries: Argentina, Mexico, Spain, and the United States.


METHODS
The study focused on the content of 163 advertisements: 69 from Spain, 16 from Mexico, 50 from Argentina, and 28 from the United States. Data were gathered on the presence of bodies not associated with the product being advertised, to study the stereotypical presentation of men and women and gender biases in advertisements in Argentina, Mexico, Spain, and the United States.


RESULTS
The following stereotypical findings were observed: (i) men were shown in public places more often than women in the ads from Argentina (P = 0.000), Spain (P = 0.000), and Mexico (P = 0.011); (ii) men were shown more often than women practicing neutral professions in the ads from Argentina (P = 0.004), Spain (P = 0.000), and Mexico (P = 0.025); and (iii) men were shown more often than women as workers and users (P = 0.000) and less often than women in a parenting role (P = 0.000). With regard to biases, (i) men were given greater visibility than women in all four countries, and (ii) only in the ads from Spain were there significant differences in terms of parity, with men appearing more often in the ads than women (P = 0.014), and empowerment, with men shown making decisions more often than women; P = 0.045).


CONCLUSIONS
Those countries with legislation aimed at using communication to prevent gender violence do not have less sexism in their advertisements.

However, little research has specifically examined individual perceptions of domestic violence victims who remain in abusive relationships. This study begins to fill the void in the literature by examining college students' attitudes toward battered women. Specifically, the study considers whether students adhere to common myths associated with battering and if myths lead college students to view domestic violence victims as “blameworthy.” The study relies on a sample of 370 university students attending a large Southern metropolitan university. Findings indicate that students moderately support domestic violence myths and that myth promotion is associated with support for increased criminal justice penalties such as prosecution of mothers and approval of delayed police response in cases of repeat victimization.

557,Addressing gender imbalances in Animal Conservation,"[Extract] The paucity of senior female scientists in science, including ecology and conservation, is a growing concern in the western world. 'Where are the women in ecology?' asked a paper in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment recently (Martin, 2012). 'Women are driven out of research', conclude O'Brien & Hapgood (2012). Despite the increasing popularity of biology, including ecology, among female undergraduates and graduates, the proportion of female scientists in top positions remains low (European Commission, 2009; Martin, 2012; O'Brien & Hapgood, 2012; Adamo, 2013). An increasing number of individuals, institutions and governmental organizations are starting to ask why so many female scientists do not end up being employed in the type of occupations in which they were trained (Rosser, 2008; Hill, Corbett & St. Rose, 2010; Royal Society of Edinburgh, 2012). There are several reasons to address this issue, especially at a time of economic austerity in many countries. Losing trained scientists can represent a sunk cost: conservative estimates put the economic cost of a PhD in the US at c. $500 000 (Rosser, 2008), while each PhD student in the UK receives c. £100 000 from the government to cover stipends and research and training expenses (UKRC, 2012). Moreover, gender diversity is associated with indirect benefits; for example, commercial busi- nesses with gender-balanced staff and management tend to perform better financially (UKRC, 2010a).",,2013,22,11,1,False,,558,11667817,M.

However, the public health community has, yet, to address how people define and understand gender equality and how they enact the process of empowerment in their lives. This study uses safe homes and respect for everyone (SHARE), an anti-violence intervention in rural Rakai, Uganda, as a case study to investigate perceptions of gender equality. Investigators analysed 12 focus groups of adult women and men to explore how macro-level concepts of gender equality are being processed on an interpersonal level and the effects on health outcomes. Respondents generally agreed that women lack basic rights. However, they also expressed widespread disagreement about the meanings of gender equality, and reported difficulties integrating the concepts of gender equality into their interpersonal relationships. Community members reported that equality, with the resulting shift in gender norms, could expose women to adverse consequences such as violence, infidelity and abandonment with increased sexual health risks, and potential adverse effects on education. Efforts to increase women's rights must occur in conjunction with community-based work on understandings of gender equality.",Global Public Health,2013,39,10,0,False,,559,102893144,Marjorie J.

562,When relationships do not live up to benevolent ideals: Women's benevolent sexism and sensitivity to relationship problems†,"Benevolent sexism promises women a revered place within intimate relationships, which should lead to greater dissatisfaction when they face relationship difficulties. We collected self-reports of relationship problems and relationship satisfaction (Study 1; N = 91 heterosexual couples), relationship problems and relationship evaluations daily over 3 weeks (Study 1), and hurtful partner behaviour and relationship evaluations over 10 days (Study 2; N = 86 women). Women's endorsement of benevolent sexism predicted sharper declines in relationship satisfaction when they faced greater relationship problems (Study 1) and hurtful partner behaviour (Study 2). These effects were magnified in longer relationships (Studies 1 and 2), indicating that the sensitivity to relationship problems associated with women's endorsement of benevolent sexism is particularly pronounced when women have more invested in their relationship role being revered and cherished. The results suggest that women who endorse benevolent sexism are vulnerable within their relationships because their satisfaction is contingent upon the fulfilment of the promises of benevolent sexism.

Pp. xv, 284. $29.95.Dale Carpenter's Flagrant Conduct: The Story of Lawrence v. Texas has been roundly greeted with well-earned praise. After exploring the book's understanding of Lawrence v. Texas as a great civil rights victory for lesbian and gay rights, this Review offers an alternative perspective on the case. Built from facts about the background of the case that the book supplies, and organized in particular around the story that the book tells about Tyrone Garner and his life, this alternative perspective on Lawrence explores and assesses some of what the decision may mean not only for sexual orientation equality but also for equality along the oftenintersecting lines of gender, class, and race. Lawrence emerges in this light not as a singular victory for lesbian and gay civil rights, or perhaps even for civil rights more generally, but as a complexly mixed opinion about and for equality in society and under law.I'm not a hero. But I feel like we've done something good for a lot of people. I feel kind of proud of that.-Tyrone Garner (p. 277)We still have a lot of work to do as far as getting equal treatment and jobs and housing and employment.-Tyrone Garner (p. 277)[F]ew remember Garner or invoke his name.-Dale Carpenter (p. 277)I. LAWRENCE V. TEXAS AND THE POLITICS OF CIVIL RIGHTSThe early returns on Dale Carpenter's Flagrant Conduct: The Story of Lawrence v. Texas1 have persistently been in the mode of high praise.2 It is easy to see why. This history of Lawrence v. Texas-culturally and legally, one of the most discussed U.S. Supreme Court decisions of the last decade, and for lesbian and gay equality the most significant constitutional breakthrough to date3-brings many of the people and events behind the decision, hence the decision itself, to life in a thoroughly engaging and informative way. The book's deeply human-centered approach, in which Lawrence, as a legal, political, and cultural event, is revealed as the product of a vast and complex set of human actions and interactions over extended time and space, humanizes Lawrence by naming many of the figures who made it possible along the way. In the process, the book also humanizes the legal process itself, showing that it is populated by individuals-not nameless, faceless bureaucrats-who can be recognized, identified with, and, in many cases, thanked. By returning the legal system to the public this way, the book reveals the democratic and egalitarian spirit animating it, a spirit that is felt in its narrative progression-Lawrence v. Texas as progress and justice achieved-as well as in its crystal-clear, at times beautiful, prose.As it happens, the same democratic and egalitarian spirit that animates the book also animates its unabashedly pro-lesbian-and-gay-equality stance, a stance within which the book achieves what many readers will regard as a notable degree of fairness and balance. Carpenter has his views, of course, and his own pro-gay political blend. But despite his associations with libertarianism and Log Cabin Republicanism, and his conservative advocacy for marriage equality, the book does not read like it is pushing a conservative political brand. Yes, at moments-some subtle, some not-the book evinces sympathies for conservatisms that might track Carpenter's views. But in one of the book's many surprises, it offers grist for a more radically progressive outlook and perspective on Lawrence than any true conservative, pro-gay manifesto ordinarily would choose. Through this telling, the book thus surpasses its title's claim. ""The Story of Lawrence v. Texas"" actually packs plurals-stories-with facets and dimensions that exceed a single plotline linked to a single-minded political game.On its own terms, the book's account of Lawrence is filled with heroes of different sizes and shapes, more, certainly, than one would have guessed based only on the judicial reports. …",,2013,6,1,1,False,,565,1799395571,Maggie Böhm,108631866,Derrick Shapley,,,,,,,,,Psychology,Review
565,Interracial Marriage Trends and Migration Patterns: An Analysis of LAFANS 2000,"We hypothesized that interracial married couples will migrate more than intraracial married couples. We focus on three mechanisms (education, social support, and discrimination) that provide explanations for interracial couples to migrate more than interracial couples. The theoretical framework included the “Push-Pull” theory and perspective on social network ties and how they link to couples migration patterns. We used information gathered in a wave of the survey conducted in 2000 for the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study. We used this survey and analyzed in a logistic regression model how the three mechanisms described above affect interracial married couples and migration patterns. The results provide a positive direction but did not provide a statistical significant due to small sample size. In conclusion, we find support from all three mechanisms for interracial marriage couples to have higher possibility for migration. Future implications should examine divorce rate and cohabitation to provide a higher migration pattern with interracial married couples.",,2013,60,4,0,False,,566,116963318,Andrew Porwancher,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
566,"Prying the gates wide open: academic freedom and gender equality at Brown University, 1974–1977","In 1974, Brown University’s Department of Anthropology denied tenure to assistant professor Louise Lamphere. Convinced that her dismissal was the product of sex discrimination, Lamphere filed suit against Brown. Lamphere and three other female scholars who joined her suit successfully pressed Brown into an out-of-court settlement in 1977. Significantly, the settlement required Brown not only to provide redress to the plaintiffs but also to take sweeping action in rectifying its faculty’s inequitable gender ratio. While Lamphere’s case marked a rare victory for academic women in the male preserve of the Ivy League, this study concerns the bearing of the lawsuit on academic freedom. It argues that academic freedom entails two interlocking principles: freedom of inquiry and departmental autonomy. Lamphere emphasised the former while Brown advocated the latter. Ultimately, the Lamphere case illustrates how academic freedom loses its efficacy when freedom of inquiry and departmental autonomy are decoupled.",,2013,14,0,0,False,,567,46385569,Lei Lai,5398154,Linda Babcock,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
567,Asian Americans and workplace discrimination: The interplay between sex of evaluators and the perception of social skills,"Summary 
In two role-playing scenarios, we investigate how White male and female evaluators perceive an Asian American versus White job candidate on the dimensions of competence and social skills and how these perceptions affect evaluators' decisions in hiring and promotion. Specifically, Study 1 examines how the perceptions of competence and social skills affect Asian (versus White) college graduates' chance of obtaining a non-technical (versus technical) position, and Study 2 tests how these perceptions affect Asians' probability of promotion relative to Whites'. Our findings suggest that female evaluators were less likely to select Asian than White candidates into positions involving social skills and were less likely to promote Asian than White candidates into these types of positions. Furthermore, female evaluators' perception that Asians were less socially skilled than Whites mediated both of these decisions. This paper contributes to the understanding of workplace discrimination of Asian Americans. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,2013,55,36,1,False,,568,4868802,George B.

570,Cardiac rehabilitation in BC: An approach based on Dr Hellerstein’s model,"Dr Herman Hellerstein was one of the first physicians to recognize there was more to cardiac disease than just the heart. In the 1950s his research led him to develop a multidisciplinary approach to cardiac rehabilitation that targeted the many facets of heart health. He went on to demonstrate that optimal treatment of heart disease requires both lifestyle modifications and med ical treatment. Today lifestyle modifications are the foundation for cardiac rehabilitation programs in Bri tish Columbia. Patients who take part in cardiac rehabilitation have an im proved quality of life and a substantially lower risk of dying. In fact, cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce mortality by as much as 26%. In spite of the known benefits, cardiac rehabilitation programs in BC are currently underutilized. We hope to change this by increasing awareness of the benefits and the availability of programs based on Dr Hellerstein’s approach to heart health. Dr Herman Hellerstein grew up in the mining town of Dillonvale, Ohio, where he witness ed firsthand the effects of poverty and poor working conditions on people. He attended medical school at Western Reserve University and soon found himself drawn to cardiology. A dedicated researcher, he examined hearts in 2000 consecutive autopsies to de termine the incidence of cardiac disease. He studied methods to cor relate ECG findings with infarct ter ritory, and worked to make ECG ma chines more usable in the office and hospital settings. He was a strong proponent of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at a time when it was felt that nothing could be done for a fibrillating heart. But he found the true passion of his life when he was approach ed by the Cardiac in Industry Com mittee in 1949 to determine if patients who had experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) could safely return to work. Pioneering post-infarction care At the time Dr Hellerstein first became involved in cardiac rehabilitation (CR), complete bed rest for 6 weeks was the treatment of choice for an infarct. The practice of allowing patients to sit up in bed or walk around the room was only slowly being adopted. Patients who had an MI were often considered invalids and advised never to return to work. In the 1950s, knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors was in its infancy. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) would not formally recognize hypercholesterolemia as a risk factor for atherosclerosis until 1961. ECG machines were bulky and considered of little use in the acute care setting. Coronary angiography and cardiac surgery were still largely experimental. Balloon angioplasty, coronary stents, thrombolysis, and coronary artery bypass grafting were not available. Medical therapy generally consisted of nitrates alone. It was in this context that Dr Hellerstein pioneered a post-infarcCardiac rehabilitation in BC: An approach based on Dr Hellerstein’s model Risk factor modification, diet, and exercise are still key to improving heart health.

Using groundbreaking ideas for the time, Dr Hellerstein forged one of the first multidisciplinary approaches to disease with a clinic staffed by physiotherapists, dietitians, vocational counselors, and psychotherapists. When he found a dearth of information on how much energy was actually expended while people performed various tasks, he began going to workplaces himself with research teams to measure blood pressure and heart rate response to activity. Initially considered radical, Dr Hel lerstein’s approach to CR, exercise, diet, and return to work faced resistance. Today his approach is widely accepted as being beneficial to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). He eventually founded the Work Classification Clinic, was ap pointed chairman of the International Society of Cardiology’s Council on Preventative Medicine and Cardiac Rehabilitation, and authored many papers and several books about heart health. His most recognized book, Healing Your Heart, shows patients how modest changes in lifestyle can lead to large reductions in cardiovascular risk. Dr Hellerstein spent much of his life promoting a healthy lifestyle for his patients and teaching his students to do the same. He died in 1993 at age 77 from cancer. Managing CAD Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the blood vessels surrounding the heart. This narrowing results from an inflammatory process that is driven by multiple associated risk factors. The beginnings of atherosclerotic plaque formation are seen even in childhood, with as many as 1 in 6 teenagers exhibiting early evidence of CAD. While the disease is common, the progression of atherosclerosis and the age when patients present to the medical system are variable. Until 2007, CAD was the largest killer of Canadians. In the Canadian 2008 mortality statistics, CAD placed a close second to cancer in all-cause death, and remained the number one killer of women. This is despite advances in cardiology that have dramatically decreased MI mortality for patients younger than 65 years old from close to 30% within the first month to less than 5%. CAD is a chronic illness rather than an acute one that we treat aggressively once and then forget about. While the flashy TV show management of an MI is often what comes to mind for both physician and patient, the much less glamorous lifestyle changes of diet, exercise, and risk factor management are what provide lasting benefits. By participating in CR, patients can decrease their risk of death from an MI by up to 26%, to a risk as low as 1%. The multidisciplinary approach pioneered by Dr Hellerstein targets physical, psychological, social, and vocational areas of a patient’s life. Ideally, it should include all of these elements, as illustrated in . Evidence for risk reduction The implementation of CR within communities has often been variable in scope and practice, which has led to difficulties in evaluating its efficaTable 1 Cardiac rehabilitation in BC: An approach based on Dr Hellerstein’s model Patient referral process Patient assessment: • Risk stratification • Exercise stress testing • Risk factor assessment Health behavior interventions and cardiovascular disease risk factor modification Nutritional counseling Risk factor counseling and management: • Lipids • Hypertension • Smoking cessation • Diabetes • Psychosocial issues • Weight management, particularly abdominal obesity • Psychosocial management • Physical activity counseling • Exercise training Patient education programs: • Health behavior adherence strategies • Medication adherence strategies Outcomes assessment programs: • Health outcomes • Educational outcomes • Behavioral outcomes • Service outcomes Continuous quality improvement programs Continuous professional development programs Reproduced with permission from Canadian Guidelines for Cardiac Rehabilitation and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention10 Table 1.

However, a recent meta-analysis by Heran and colleagues evaluated 10 794 patients with CAD who may or may not have been revascularized and who were randomly assigned to either exercise-based CR or usual care. Most of these patients were low-risk, middle-aged Caucasian males. Within less than a year of follow-up, CR was found to reduce hospital admissions by 31%. In the longer term, CR was found to significantly reduce overall mortality by 13% and cardiovascular mortality by 26%. This was consistent with previous meta-analyses. Taylor and colleagues showed a decrease of 20% in all-cause mortality and a de crease of 26% in cardiovascular mortality with CR, while Clark and colleagues demonstrated a 15% decrease in all-cause mortality. In addition, while the meta-analyses by Heran and Taylor were unable to demonstrate a reduced incidence of MI or need for revascularization, Clark’s 2004 metaanalysis showed a 17% overall reduction in recurrent MI over a median 12month follow-up period. Beneficial for all One of the most powerful aspects of CR is that the benefits transcend age and sex. In fact, women and the elderly, who have been traditionally underserved by CR programs in the past, stand to gain significantly from participating. The prevalence of CAD increases with age, and as the Canadian population ages we will need to focus on prevention of coronary events to reduce the burden on our health care system. A normally aging person develops a blunted response to physical exercise, decreased oxygen uptake, and decreas ed cardiac output at maximal exercise. When compared with their younger counterparts, however, elderly patients have comparable relative increases in exercise tolerance with exercise training. In the past, women may have been less likely to attend a CR program because many were older than men when they first presented with an MI. While women still tend to be older at first presentation, those at tending CR programs have been shown to achieve significant reductions in in flammatory markers, as well as reductions in other cardiac risk factors.

576,“That's So Gay!” Exploring College Students' Attitudes Toward the LGBT Population,"Traditional students are often introduced to unfamiliar subcultures for the first time on the college campus. Recent high school graduates find themselves transitioning from an atmosphere in which homophobia is likely to be tolerated and possibly even expected to an educational setting in which diversity is promoted. Research shows that the college years are influential in the re-socialization of core values, yet very little work focuses on the ideological shifts that may take place in attitudes toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) population. The research presented in this study includes a modified version of LaMar and Kite's Component Measure, which has been broken down into 6 distinctive components of tolerance. In addition to examining religion, gender, and race—factors that have been correlated in past research with differing levels of tolerance toward the LGBT community—this study adds politics, sexual orientation, academic class standing, and college of major—variables that have received little or no attention in this literature. Higher levels of LGBT tolerance are consistently observed across the indexes among women, more liberal Christian traditions, non-Christian faiths, the non-religious, and those who self-identify as LGBT. The distinctive contribution of this study is that students in the College of Arts and Sciences and students further along in their college careers are also more tolerant.

However, rarely has patriarchy been examined as an outcome across studies. The current study works toward filling this gap by examining several individualand neighborhood-level factors that might influence patriarchy. Specifically, this research seeks to determine if neighborhood-level attributes related to socioeconomic status, family composition, and demographic information affect patriarchal views after individual-level correlates of patriarchy were controlled. Findings suggest that factors at both the individualand neighborhood levels, particularly familial characteristics and dynamics, do influence the endorsement of patriarchal views.

581,Counseling Jewish Women: A Phenomenological Study,"Over the last 2 decades, social scientists have noted the lack of attention the field of psychology has paid to religion, especially compared with other multicultural variables such as race (Schlosser, Foley, Poltrock Stein, & Holmwood, 2010). In particular, Kielty Briggs and Dixon Rayle (2005) concluded that many counselor program directors and educators are unclear as to how to integrate religious issues into core courses and counselor education curricula accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs. Thus, few counseling trainees receive adequate supervision to competently address clients' religion in counseling (Hall, Dixon, & Mauzey, 2004; Levitt & Balkin, 2003). Regarding Jewish realities, counseling scholars have also observed the relative invisibility of Jews as a topic matter in the counseling literature and multicultural counseling movement (Altman, Inman, Fine, Ritter, & Howard, 2010; Torton Beck, Goldberg, & Knefelkamp, 2003). Fischer and Moradi (2001) contended that ""conspicuously absent from the multicultural counseling literature are theory and research related to the Jewish people"" (p. 351). Specifically, in his review, Langman (1999) concluded that ""books, journals, classes, and conferences in counseling and psychology make little mention of Jews, Jewish issues, or anti-Semitism"" (p. 2). Several writers have theorized that this notable absence may emanate from (a) high levels of Jewish assimilation (Langman, 1995), (b) viewing Jews solely as members of a religious sect (Friedman, Friedlander, & Bluestein, 2005), or (c) anti-Semitism (Weinrach, 2002). Moreover, MacDonald-Dennis (2006) proposed that Jews are often ignored because they are classified as members of the general White American majority. In her aptly titled book, How Jews Became White Folks, Brodkin (1998) discussed this post-World War II equation of Jews equaling White and how this racial categorization was never considered before. Naumburg (2007) noted that clinicians tend to view their Jewish clients, except for those who are visibly religious Jews, as Caucasian Americans, unaware that being Jewish is a hidden diversity that ""requires a willingness to see beyond white skin and be aware of potential differences that lie beneath the surface"" (p. 80). Thus, Yeung and Greenwald (1992) and Schlosser (2006) concluded that counselors' lack of awareness of Jewish realities results in their being ill-prepared to fully help Jewish clients in counseling. This reality is problematic because many non-Orthodox, American Jews view psychotherapy favorably and ""are likely to utilize psychotherapy services"" (Schlosser, 2006, p. 425). Scholars, however, have recently begun to gather data on Jewish identity that focus on religious denomination. Specifically, Hartman and Hartman (1999) looked at nine Jewish religious and ethnic identity components of 610,000 New York Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox households and concluded that the strength of Jewish identity is highly related to Jewish denomination. Similarly, Friedman et al.'s (2005) qualitative study of 10 Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and nonaffiliated Jewish adults revealed that Conservative Jewish Americans may experience themselves as bicultural, that is, both Jewish and American. Next, Altman et al. (2010) explored the unique nature of the Jewish ethnic identity of 10 young adult, Conservative Jewish Americans and discovered six themes that inform participants' Jewish identity. Although these studies signify a positive change in the counseling field's interest in studying Jewish life, there is only one published data-based article that specifically looks at Jewish women, namely Goldberg and O'Brien's (2005) study on attachment, and one dissertation examining Jewish women's body image (Greenberg, 2009). There are, however, several books and articles that have shed theoretical light on the unique ways Jewish women understand their lives and identities and how this holds implications for counseling (see Green & Brodbar, 2011; Josefowitz Siegel & Cole, 1991, 1997; Weiner & Moon, 1995). …",,2013,21,30,5,False,,582,52214631,Amineh Abbas,34694309,J.

Studies in the review examined factors for perpetration by and against adolescents and adults, by male and female perpetrators, and by those who offended against individuals of the same sex or opposite sex. Factors associated with child sexual abuse (CSA) perpetration were not included. In all, 2 societal and community factors, 23 relationship factors, and 42 individual-level factors were identified. Of these 67 factors, consistent significant support for their association with SV was found for 35, nonsignificant effects were found for 10, 7 factors had limited or sample-specific evidence that they were associated with SV but were in need of further study, and 15 demonstrated mixed results. The factors identified in the review underscore the need for comprehensive prevention programs that target multiple risk and protective factors as well as factors that occur across the social ecology. Moreover, we identified two domains of factors—the presence and acceptance of violence and unhealthy sexual behaviors, experiences, or attitudes—that had consistent significant associations with SV but are not typically addressed in prevention programs. Therefore, SV prevention may also benefit from learning from effective strategies in other areas of public health, namely sexual health and youth violence prevention.","Trauma, Violence, & Abuse",2013,253,333,28,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Two domains of factors—the presence and acceptance of violence and unhealthy sexual behaviors, experiences, or attitudes—that had consistent significant associations with SV but are not typically addressed in prevention programs are identified.'}",584,46460700,Kristof Dhont,4572371,A.

592,Social Mating System and Sex-Biased Dispersal in Mammals and Birds: A Phylogenetic Analysis,"The hypothesis that patterns of sex-biased dispersal are related to social mating system in mammals and birds has gained widespread acceptance over the past 30 years. However, two major complications have obscured the relationship between these two behaviors: 1) dispersal frequency and dispersal distance, which measure different aspects of the dispersal process, have often been confounded, and 2) the relationship between mating system and sex-biased dispersal in these vertebrate groups has not been examined using modern phylogenetic comparative methods. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the relationship between mating system and sex-biased dispersal in mammals and birds. Results indicate that the evolution of female-biased dispersal in mammals may be more likely on monogamous branches of the phylogeny, and that females may disperse farther than males in socially monogamous mammalian species. However, we found no support for a relationship between social mating system and sex-biased dispersal in birds when the effects of phylogeny are taken into consideration. We caution that although there are larger-scale behavioral differences in mating system and sex-biased dispersal between mammals and birds, mating system and sex-biased dispersal are far from perfectly associated within these taxa.",PLoS ONE,2013,101,107,8,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results indicate that the evolution of female-biased dispersal in mammals may be more likely on monogamous branches of the phylogeny, and that females may disperse farther than males in socially monogamous mammalian species.'}",593,80969161,O.

593,Talking at cross-purposes? The missing link between feminist linguistics and translation studies,"Following decades of feminist linguistic activism, and as a result of a greater awareness of the vital role that non-sexist language plays in achieving social equality, different campaigns were launched in many countries leading to a more frequent use of so-called inclusive language. Bringing this together with current theoretical approaches to translation studies which have been defining translation as an ideological act of intercultural mediation since the 1990’s, this article seeks to examine to what extent feminist linguistics have had any influence on translation studies. My purpose is to assess whether particular feminist linguistic interventions in vogue when writing ‘original’ texts within the realm of the source language are also adopted when (re)writing ‘translated’ texts in the target language, bearing in mind the double (con)textual responsibility that translators have towards the source and the target (con)texts. I will examine the arguments for and against the use of inclusive language in (literary) translation through an analysis of the “ideological struggle” that emerged from two ideologically disparate rewritings of gender markers into Galician of the British bestseller The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Mark Haddon (2003), focusing on the ideological, poetic and economic pressures that (still) define the professional practice of translation. It is my contention that the close scrutiny of these conflicting arguments will shed light not only on the existing gap between the theory and practice of translation, but may be also indicative of a possible ‘missing link’ between feminist approaches to linguistics and to translation studies.",,2013,0,9,1,False,,594,152648512,F.

595,[Gender bias in the management and outcome of cardiovascular patients in Friuli Venezia Giulia (Northern Italy)].,"OBJECTIVE
to assess whether there are any differences depending on the patient's gender in the acute management of patients with symptoms compatible with coronary disease or admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis or coronary disease in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Northern Italy).


DESIGN
retrospective analysis of the Emergency Room (ER) and Hospitalization databases of the regional health information system.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
the study included all the patients who arrived at one of the 18 regional ERs because of chest pain, and all the patients admitted to one of the regional hospitals with a diagnosis of coronary disease in 2010.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
for both genders,waiting times from triage to the physician's visit, electrocardiogram (ECG) frequency in the ER among patients with chest pain and frequency of coronary angioplasty, and intrahospital mortality among patients admitted with a diagnosis of coronary disease were evaluated.


RESULTS
women arriving at an ER with chest pain waited on average 3 minutes more than men before being visited by a physician (24.9 vs. 21.9 minutes); however, the likelihood of undergoing ECG was similar in the two genders (54.4%vs. 55.0%; OR: 0.96, 95%CI 0.89-1.03). Women admitted to the hospital because of coronary disease undergo coronary angioplasty less frequently than men (29.1%vs. 43.5%; OR: 0.67, 95%CI 0.57- 0.78). Intrahospital mortality was 7.6%in men and 4.3%in women, however, it was similar after adjustment for confounders. Among patients <65 years it was 3 times higher for women than for men.


CONCLUSION
some gender differences in the management of patients were observed. Further research is warranted to assess whether those differences reflect appropriate care or whether they indicate the existence of a gender bias affecting the decisions of healthcare professionals.",Epidemiologia & Prevenzione,2013,0,0,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Some gender differences in the management of patients were observed, and further research is warranted to assess whether those differences reflect appropriate care or whether they indicate the existence of a gender bias affecting the decisions of healthcare professionals.'}",596,34758613,Lucy Diep,2210966,G.

Communication Technologies Including Brain-Machine Interfaces Revealed from the Perspectives of Special Education School Teachers Through an Ableism Lens,"Some new and envisioned technologies such as brain machine interfaces (BMI) that are being developed initially for people with disabilities, but whose use can also be expanded to the general public have the potential to change body ability expectations of disabled and non-disabled people beyond the species-typical. The ways in which this dynamic will impact students with disabilities in the domain of special education is explored. Data was drawn from six special education school teachers from one school in Calgary, Alberta. Five sub-themes (social acceptance, not adding to the impairment, fear of judgement by society, pursuing “normality” and meeting the demands of society) were identified that fit under the main identified theme of “fitting in by not standing out”. Findings demonstrate a dichotomy in participant views of non- or socially acceptable communication devices. The perception of BMI technology was also explored among special education school teachers, revealing benefits and challenges with the uptake of this technology for students with disabilities.

599,On Canicide and Concern: Species Sovereignty in Western Accounts of Rwanda's Genocide,"There is no ""crime against animality"" nor crime of genocide against nonhuman living beings. Jacques Derrida The Beast and the Sovereign Dogs, in their historical complexity, matter here. Dogs are not an alibi for other themes; dogs are fleshly material semiotic presences in the body of technoscience. Dogs are not surrogates for theory; they are not here just to think with. They are here to live with. Partners in the crime of human evolution, they are in the garden from the get-go, wily as Coyote. Donna Haraway The Companion Species Manifesto THE OPENING PAGES of James Dawes's That the World May Know offer one of the few descriptions of the unique fate of dogs in Rwanda's genocide. The author recounts a story of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) having encountered, in their liberation of the nation, dogs that ""were unusually large and fierce, having fed well on the heaps of corpses choking the roadways. RPF soldiers, sickened by this final indignity, began to shoot the dogs. Immediately, animal rights groups in London launched a protest to protect the dogs"" (20). Dawes later cites this protest as evidence that ""the genocide becomes primarily an occasion for whites to fantasize about themselves,"" an act of ""moral self-congratulation"" (33). The genocide of some eight hundred thousand Rwandans (mostly Tutsis) in 1994 was largely overlooked by the West, and Dawes uses this show of concern for animals to emphasize the flagrant disregard for Rwandan humans between April and July 1994. (1) Although Dawes problematizes the interest in animal rights that overlooks human rights, his text defines animals exclusively in terms of the indignity they perform on humans, showing no concern for their lives and deaths. Given this indignity, are shows of concern for animals allowed? Is it permissible, for instance, to suggest that dogs feeding on the dead and the production of canine ferocity have a history, not only in narratives like Dawes's but also in a genocidal political climate in whose memory ethical concern for the non-human is unquestioningly suspended? When the UN troops stationed in Rwanda declared the dogs a ""health problem"" (as many texts document), how should we understand the relationship between this biopolitical claim on dogs' bodies and concern? I begin with Dawes in order to think about how texts direct our concern in particular ways when we think of postgenocide Rwanda, especially when various figures of animality become categories--applied to both humans and non-humans--for which concern is suspended. This paper theorizes concern as a technology of relationality that affectively orients how we associate with others across interpersonal, international, and interspecies contexts, one that accompanies processes of narration and representation to produce certain lives as subjects of legitimate ethical engagement, and others as objects for whom ethical engagement is not, or does not have to be, a consideration. Interrogating Western texts' handling of the fate of the dogs, I argue that these texts' attempts to account for, bear witness to, and especially (belatedly) show concern for the Rwandan genocide construct the animal as a marker of non-concern, a category for which concern is always already foreclosed. In the global handling of conflict, the animal is used to direct the trajectory of concern toward the human and away from those deemed beyond the categorical limits of humanness, separating and elevating human concerns from those of non-human life. This reading follows recent postcolonial analyses, in the era of what Rob Nixon calls the ""slow violence"" of environmental degradation (11), which demonstrate that--particularly in postcolonial fields of knowledge-making and situations of conflict--human and non-human concerns cannot easily be separated as independent from one another. (2) The first section of this paper examines how the orientation of concern in certain Western accounts of the genocide produces a species sovereignty of the human that disavows its ties with the non-human. …",,2013,64,3,0,False,,600,47542137,M.

601,Who stereotypes female candidates? Identifying individual differences in feminine stereotype reliance,"Increasing numbers of women are running for political office at the local, state, and national levels. Existing research offers unclear conclusions about whether feminine stereotypes are an electoral constraint for female candidates. An underlying assumption in this scholarship is that all types of individuals rely on similar processes to form electoral assessments of female candidates. This study tests the assumption of equitable stereotype reliance across individuals. I integrate theories from psychology about which types of individuals are most likely to use stereotypes to judge others, and consider how these determinants operate in a political context. I argue that whether an individual relies on feminine stereotypes to evaluate a female candidate depends on characteristics such as attention to politics, partisanship, and other relevant demographic characteristics. An original survey experiment identifies how individual characteristics affect whether a voter turns to feminine stereotypes when a woman runs for office. These findings are consequential because individuals who rely on feminine stereotypes are also less likely to vote for a female candidate.",,2015,58,83,5,False,,602,4004426,Alexander M.

605,Menarche and Menstruation Through the Eyes of Pubescent Students in Eastern Taiwan: Implications in Sociocultural Influence and Gender Differences Issues,"Background: Menstruation is a significant part of women’s lives. It has been studied from many perspectives to draw various conclusions about biological and physiological development, gender differences, and sociocultural environments. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore how male and female pubescent students perceive and interpret menarche and menstruation and how their perceptions reflect gender differences and the sociocultural environment in eastern Taiwan. Methods: This was an exploratory qualitative study that employed focus group interviews. Data were collected from 20 girls and 27 boys, aged 10–12 years, who were recruited from two elementary schools. Participants engaged in 19 focus group discussions, which lasted 45–60 minutes each. Discussion transcripts were collected, encoded, categorized, and analyzed using the Atlas V 5.0 software. Results: The central theme in menarche and menstruation experiences among pubescent students in eastern Taiwan can be summarized as, “Struggling to grow up amidst contradictions,” an attitude that reflects gender divisions and sociocultural representations and practices. Generally, participants’ views on menstruation fell within five subthemes: “Ambiguous,” “Disregarded,” “Dirty,” “Personal,” and “Transitional.” These themes were analyzed within the contexts of society, school, and family. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: In line with previous research, this study shows the need for more individual reproductive health consultations, reliable sex education, and well-planned health policies to assist pubescent students manage menstruation.

608,The UK National Health Service: Delivering Equitable Treatment Across the Spectrum of Coronary Disease,"Background—Social gradients in cardiovascular mortality across the United Kingdom may reflect differences in incidence, disease severity, or treatment. It is unknown whether a universal healthcare system delivers equitable lifesaving medical therapy for coronary heart disease. We therefore examined secular trends in the use of key medical therapies stratified by socioeconomic circumstances across a broad spectrum of coronary disease presentations, including acute coronary syndromes, secondary prevention, and clinical angina. Methods and Results—This was a cross-sectional observational analysis of nationally representative primary and secondary care data from the United Kingdom. Data on treatments for all myocardial infarction patients in 2003 and 2007 were derived from the Myocardial Ischemia National Audit Project (n=51 755). Data on treatments for patients with chronic angina (n=33 211) or requiring secondary prevention (n=32 976) in 1999 and 2007 were extracted from the General Practice Research Database. Socioeconomic circumstances were defined using a weighted composite of 7 area-level deprivation domains. Treatment estimates were age-standardized. Use of all therapies increased in all patient groups, both men and women. Improvements were most marked in primary care, where use of &bgr;-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for secondary prevention and treatment of angina doubled, from ≈30% to >60%. Small age gradients persisted for some therapies. No consistent socioeconomic gradients or sex differences were observed for myocardial infarction and postrevascularization (hard diagnoses). However, some sex inequality was apparent in the treatment of younger women with angina. Conclusions—Cardiovascular treatment is generally equitable and independent of socioeconomic circumstances. Future strategies should aim to further increase overall treatment levels and to eradicate remaining age and sex inequalities.",Circulation.

609,Frame Spillover: Media Framing and Public Opinion of a Multifaceted LGBT Rights Agenda,"Between May and July 2003, a shift in how the US public viewed the legality of consensual homosexual sex occurred. While in May the largest percentage of respondents to date supported decriminalizing such activity, that percentage dropped eleven points two months later. Similar declines in support were evident in the same period over a range of gay and lesbian rights claims. The ruling in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) decriminalizing homosexual sex is the obvious intervening event. To explain this pattern, coding of print and televised news coverage of the ruling throughout 2003 was undertaken. Coverage was not overtly negative in terms of antigay rhetoric or hostility toward the judiciary; rather, the dominant media frame focused on the implications of Lawrence for an entirely separate rights issue: marriage equality. This article examines the dynamic of frame “spillover,” or the idea that media focus on a distinct and not widely supported rights claim in a multifaceted rights agenda might depress support across the entire rights agenda. The findings call for further research, and they have implications for scholarship on public opinion, social movement framing, and ideational development and policy debate as studied within the broader field of American political development.",Law &#x0026; Social Inquiry,2013,187,34,6,False,,610,2077018953,S.

615,State of the science: does the theory of maternal role attainment apply to African American motherhood?,"INTRODUCTION
This article reviews the current state of knowledge of the theory of maternal role attainment (MRA) and its relevance in describing African American motherhood. EBSCOhost Research Databases that included PubMed, CINAHL plus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched for journal articles that examined maternal identity and MRA. Keyword searches included maternal identity, maternal role attainment, becoming a mother, prenatal attachment, maternal-fetal attachment, and maternal-infant attachment. Inclusion criteria for this review were published journal articles of studies conducted in the United States, with a clear delineation of the theoretical framework of MRA. Journal articles that measured MRA among women with depression or medically fragile infants were excluded. Two hundred and twelve studies were reviewed; 25 studies, published between 1975 and 2007, met the inclusion criteria. Nine articles described the theory of MRA, 11 articles measured variables thought to influence MRA, and 6 articles described maternal-fetal attachment, a construct of MRA.


METHODS
Studies were reviewed, categorized, and analyzed to determine current knowledge of how the theory of MRA describes African American motherhood. Categories included studies describing the theoretical framework of maternal identity and MRA, studies measuring key variables thought to impact MRA, and studies measuring maternal-fetal attachment and maternal-infant attachment.


RESULTS
The studies were limited by homogenous samples of upper-middle-class white women and low-income, single, African American adolescents. Study results of MRA cannot be generalized to African American women.


DISCUSSION

616,"“Andrea Dworkin was probably turning in her grave”: Pornography, (Post)Feminist Backlash and Contemporary Women's Memoirs","Summary In a comment that is perhaps representative of new voices in contemporary feminist criticism, Natasha Walter states that in the 1970s “[a]ll treatments of sexuality in culture were forced to reveal the imprint of sexism”. She concludes that a minority of feminists perceived “any hint of sexuality in culture” as “proof of sexism” (Walter 1999: 112). Now, in the 21st century, the representation of dominant female sexuality, across all mediums of visual and textual expression, predominantly avoids the usual cultural trap of promiscuity; the image of the uncontrolled nymphomaniac, and it is this climate of active female sexual expression and a more inclusive (post)feminist discourse that has seen recent erotic non-fiction memoirs thrive. In this article, I will discuss three recent erotic memoirs: Melissa P.'s One Hundred Strokes of the Brush before Bed (2004), Toni Bentley's The Surrender: An Erotic Memoir (2006) and Catherine Townsend's Breaking the Rules: Confessions of a Bad Girl (2008). In the context of these memoirs, I will discuss the manner in which the texts celebrate, rather than contest, the eroticisation of male power and sexual values ascribed by the mainstreaming of the sex industry, and demonstrate how, in the context of postfeminist rhetoric and second-wave feminist backlash, this eroticisation of male power is represented, contentiously and divisively, as ostensibly liberating to women.",,2013,18,2,0,False,,617,2093345056,Michael Hill,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

618,Extended cardiac rehabilitation for socially vulnerable patients improves attendance and outcome.,"INTRODUCTION
Patients living alone or having a low socioeconomic status are likely to quit cardiac rehabilitation. We aimed to compare patients being offered extended rehabilitation (ERP) with those being offered standard rehabilitation (SRP) as concerns 1) attendance rates and 2) achievement of treatment goals at 12 months.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
During a five-year period, 508 consecutive myocardial infarction patients below the age of 70 years were included. In the first two years of the study, 205 patients were offered SRP (historic controls); during the last three years of the study, 303 patients were identified of whom socially non-vulnerable patients were assigned to SRP and socially vulnerable patients were assigned to ERP.


RESULTS
Socially vulnerable patients achieved significantly higher participation rates (97.7%) than controls (75.0%), p < 0.0001, if they were offered ERP. There was no difference in cardiac rehabilitation attendance rate among socially non-vulnerable patients compared to controls (84.7% versus 82.1, p = 0.64). Socially vulnerable patients being offered ERP also had lower levels of cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and body mass index, and a higher level of compliance with medication than controls.


CONCLUSION
Extended offers for socially vulnerable patients improve attendance rates for cardiac rehabilitation and seem to improve the share of patients achieving treatment goals.


FUNDING
The Ministry of the Interior and Health, the Ministry of Social Affairs in Denmark, The Danish Heart Foundation and Aarhus University Hospital Research Initiative funded the present study.

622,Selling out (in) sport management: practically evaluating the state of the American (Sporting) Union,"When teaching in Sport Management programs professors are often forced to respond to the actions and teachings of professionals in the field. According to the study by Kincheloe & Steinberg many of these normalized and, indeed celebrated, behaviors are actions that are part and parcel of the ‘recovery movement’ which (re)inscribe new forms of colonization, sexism, racism, classism and so on. Given that these performances are often considered ‘good business practice’, it is now more important than ever to challenge these conventions in what has been termed the post-neoliberal moment. This paper, therefore, analyzes and explains how the mundane recycling of borrowed thought has seeped into America's collegiate educational system—particularly in sport management programs. It does so through a critical examination of Amber's educational and pre-professional experience as an intern for various sporting constituencies. Further, we examine the disguised precedence and obligatory requisites of the sporting industry, which use exploitative and manipulative marketing tactics to fabricate a hyperreal milieu of sporting production and consumption. Given this context, the project at present seeks to (re)evaluate just what we, as teachers, owe our students as they venture into an economy facing ‘hard times’.",,2013,72,15,1,False,,623,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
623,Male and female sluts: Shifts and stabilities in the regulation of sexual relations among young heterosexual men,": Contemporary sexual relations are marked by a powerful double standard, in which women’s but not men’s sexual behaviour is policed and disciplined. There is some evidence, however, that constructions of sexual reputation are shifting. Qualitative research among young heterosexual men in Australia finds that some express concern about being perceived as a ‘male slut’ because of excessive or inappropriate sexual activity. This signals a slight weakening of the sexual double standard. At the same time, this and other negative constructions of male sexual reputation are policed only by women, and they sit alongside men’s ongoing support for divisions of women into ‘nice girls’ and ‘sluts’.",,2017,40,8,1,False,,624,33402050,R.

624,INTRODUCTION: Master Builders: Research on Men and Masculinities and Directions for Australian Theory and Practice,"Research on men and masculinities is not just an academic exercise. It deals with issues of practical importance and widespread cultural interest, which are explored in many media besides research. One of the most striking examples is The Master Builder, by the founder of modern European drama, Henrik Ibsen (1992). This play, first performed in 1892, is one of the great allegories of modern masculinity. It is not quite as famous as A Doll House, and its central figure is not quite as iconic as Nora, whose slamming door at the end of Act III became an international symbol of women’s emancipation. Nevertheless, the protagonist Halvard Solness does represent a significant type of masculinity emerging in European modernity. Solness is a ‘master builder’, an employer of labour, but not part of the old elite. He is, precisely, what we would call a developer. If he were alive in Australia today he would undoubtedly have mates in the NSW branch of the Liberal or Labor Parties. He is selfmade. He contracted an advantageous marriage and then leveraged that advantage with energy and skill. He has achieved respect as well as wealth. Yet underneath this success is a psychological mess. Solness has doubts about his achievement, guilt about his troubled wife and her destroyed home. He is fearful of the rising generation who will become his competitors and, perhaps, prove better than him. His life is finally shaken from its moorings by the arrival of an idealistic young woman who misinterprets his role. Solness’s story ends in a heavily symbolic death in an industrial accident on his newest building. Ibsen’s work is worth recalling as a sign of the wide interest in problems of masculinity and as a notable diagnosis of the complexity and, in fact, the fragility of apparently confident forms of masculinity. There is a cultural context for our research in social science, and we have much to learn from it.",,2013,21,6,0,False,,625,21687196,H. V. D. Akker,103586599,R. Ploeg,66168719,P.

625,Disapproval of Homosexuality: Comparative Research on Individual and National Determinants of Disapproval of Homosexuality in 20 European Countries,"In this contribution, we elaborate on disapproval of homosexuality in 20 European countries. We mainly focus on the explanation of differences in the disapproval of homosexuality at the individual and the national level. Data from four waves of the European Social Survey are used, using multilevel techniques to test our hypotheses. Individual differences in disapproval of homosexuality can be derived from theories of socializing agents (religious institutions, schools) and socializing circumstances as well as from psychological theories on conventionalism and tradition. We find that religious people, people who support conventionalism, and those who attach to traditions disapprove of homosexuality more, whereas highly educated people disapprove less. Differences between countries can be explained by socializing circumstances of the national context as the countries’ religiosity and laws on homosexuality turned out to be important determinants of the disapproval of homosexuality. We found that disapproval of homosexuality is the least in countries where law permits homosexuals to marry. In addition, people who live in more religious countries disapprove of homosexuality more than people who live in secular countries.",,2013,39,201,11,False,,626,1925177,B.

626,Racial and Gender Discrimination in the Stress Process: Implications for African American Women's Health and Well-Being,"In recent decades, sociologists have increasingly adopted an intersectionality framework to explore and explain the complex and interconnected nature of inequalities in the areas of race, class, and gender. Using an inclusion-centered approach and a sample of 204 low-socioeconomic-status (SES) African American women, the authors theorize and explore the role of racial and gender discrimination in the stress process. Analyses examine relationships between social stressors (racial and gender discrimination) and individual stressors occurring in each of six distinct social contexts. Furthermore, the authors evaluate the effects of racial and gender discrimination as compared to individual stressors on three indicators of mental health and well-being. Findings suggest that racial and gender discrimination increases risk for poor health and low well-being, working both directly and indirectly through increased vulnerability to individual stressors. This research demonstrates the value of a more comprehensive study of stressors that influence the health of low-SES African American women and other multiply disadvantaged groups.",Sociological perspectives,2013,95,208,6,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is suggested that racial and gender discrimination increases risk for poor health and low well-being, working both directly and indirectly through increased vulnerability to individual stressors.'}",627,47454709,Kristine M.

631,Positive Portrayals of Feminist Men Increase Men’s Solidarity With Feminists and Collective Action Intentions,"The present study examined whether positive portrayals of feminist men could increase men’s sense of solidarity with feminists and, through it, their intentions to engage in collective action in support of women. A sample of 102 mostly White men between the ages of 18 and 63 was recruited from Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing marketplace. They were exposed to a short article either portraying feminist men in a positive light, a negative light, or describing the history of feminism without mentioning men. Men who read the positive portrayal article expressed more solidarity with feminists and greater intentions to engage in collective action in support of women than men who read either the history of feminism article or the negative portrayal article. Feminist solidarity fully mediated the relationship between positive portrayals of feminist men and collective action intentions. Consistent with research among women, the findings demonstrate that feeling connected to feminists is an important antecedent of men’s collective action in support of women. They also suggest a novel approach for involving men in collective action in support of women: building a positive image of feminist men. The implications of the findings for the men’s role in the feminist movement are discussed.",,2013,69,52,5,False,,632,33114432,H. Bowles,5398154,Linda Babcock,,,,,,,,,Psychology,JournalArticle
632,How Can Women Escape the Compensation Negotiation Dilemma? Relational Accounts Are One Answer,"Policy makers, academics, and media reports suggest that women could shrink the gender pay gap by negotiating more effectively for higher compensation. Yet women entering compensation negotiations face a dilemma: They have to weigh the benefits of negotiating against the social consequences of having negotiated. Research shows that women are penalized socially more than men for negotiating for higher pay. To address this dilemma, the authors test strategies to help women improve both their negotiation and social outcomes in compensation negotiations. In Study 1, communicating concern for organizational relationships improved female negotiators’ social outcomes, and offering a legitimate account for compensation requests improved negotiation outcomes. However, neither strategy—alone or in combination—improved both women’s social and negotiation outcomes. Study 2 tested two strategies devised to improve female negotiators’ social and negotiation outcomes by explaining why a compensation request is legitimate in relational terms. Results showed that, although adherence to the feminine stereotype is insufficient, using these “relational accounts” can improve women’s social and negotiation outcomes at the same time. Normative implications of conformity to gender stereotypes to reduce gender pay disparities are discussed.",,2013,94,103,5,False,,633,46343915,S. Simon,32047738,Crystal L.

Study 2 then directly assessed the effect of media images of women on female participants’ self-reported responses following a leadership task. Women exposed to media images of women in counterstereotypical roles reported less negative self-perceptions and greater leadership aspirations than women exposed to images of women in stereotypical roles. Moreover, negative self-perceptions mediated the relationship between media images and leadership aspirations.

We examined the role of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) in predicting prejudice toward Americans, mediating the relationships between personality dimensions and prejudice, and predicting intergroup emotions indirectly through intergroup threat perceptions. Three main findings emerged. First, whereas RWA was a positive predictor of prejudice toward Americans, SDO was a negative predictor. Second, RWA mediated a positive relationship between a social conforming personality and prejudice toward Americans; SDO mediated a negative relationship between a tough-minded personality and prejudice. Third, value threat perceptions mediated a positive relationship between RWA and feelings of disgust toward Americans; economic threat perceptions mediated a negative relationship between SDO and anger toward Americans.

A total of 181undergraduate students read a trial transcript involving an allegation of spousal abuse in which defendant and victim race were manipulated using photographs. They then provided a verdict and confidence rating, a sentence, and responsibility attributions, and completed various scales measuring attitudes toward wife abuse and women. Findings revealed that female jurors were harsher toward the defendant than were male jurors. When controlling for attitudes toward Asians, jurors found the defendant guilty more often in cases involving interracial couples, as compared to same-race couples. Path analyses revealed various factors and attitudes involved in domestic violence trial outcomes.

643,"Sexual diversity, discrimination and ‘homosexuality policy’ in New South Wales' government schools","Lesbians and gay men have historically been derided, harassed, silenced and made invisible in Australia. This prejudice and discrimination has been reinforced structurally through social, cultural and political institutions. Although sexual orientation is now included in state and territory anti-discrimination legislation, and recent federal legislative change supports greater parity with the rights of heterosexuals, there is still discrimination towards lesbians and gay men. This paper examines some of the ways that lesbians' and gay male subjectivities are discursively constructed in modern-day Australia. It then reviews the ongoing negative and complex effects of such discourses on same-sex-attracted individuals in schools, schooling cultures and teacher pedagogies. This provides the background for a review of New South Wales Government education policy on ‘homosexuality’ and argues that this policy ultimately reinforces unhelpful discourses about sexual diversity, and fails to reflect the complexities and fluidities of sexual identities. Although policy implementation in schools in itself can be complex, strong and visible support ‘from the top’ in the form of relevant policy is critical to foster widespread action, understanding and cultural change in schools.",,2013,100,29,1,False,,644,2109294797,Jioni A.

In three experiments, a three-way interaction was revealed, where the effect of a cue to bias varied as a function of both the ethnicity and sex of the target person. Some targets (White males) were generally rated less favorably when judges were reminded of bias, whereas other targets (Black males, Middle Eastern males and White females) were generally rated more favorably, indicating bidirectional correction. Finally, a normative account of the results was explored. In a pattern consistent with the experimental results, it was considered more important to avoid overrating White men than all other groups, and more important to avoid underrating all other groups than White men.

651,"U.S. Graduate Social Work Faculty's Attitudes Toward Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People","ABSTRACT Social workers are expected to promote social justice for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and social work programs and their faculty are expected to prepare students for competent and ethical practice with LGBT people and communities. Faculty's LGBT social attitudes can play a central role in developing students’ competencies. Minimal attention has been given to the nature of faculty's LGBT social attitudes. This article presents the results of a national survey conducted in the United States with a random sample of graduate teaching faculty concerning their LGBT social attitudes (n = 161). Bivariate and multivariate predictors of LGBT social attitudes were identified. Although a number of factors were significant in bivariate analyses and initial multivariate analysis (controlling only for sociodemographics), the final estimated model suggests race and social attitudes about women and critical consciousness are significant. The authors outline recommendations to enhance faculty's attitudes to strengthen efforts to realize accreditation standards and better prepare students for culturally competent and ethical practice. In addition to examining other predictors of faculty's attitudes, future studies should investigate perceptions of each separate population comprising the LGBT community.",,2013,64,37,0,False,,653,14108705,Thorayya Said Giovannelli,50742624,LaTrelle D.

A sample of 2216 youth was randomly selected from all the twelve Governorates in Jordan. A questionnaire was developed to attain the goal of this study, means, standard deviation, t value, and p – value were used. Results showed that Jordanian youth accept violence against women mean > 3, 00, significance level < 0, 05. The findings also showed the most important causes of violence against women as perceived by youth are women not participating in family decisions and lack of religious commitment. It also revealed the most effect of violence against women as seen by youth breaking up of the family and causing continuous worries to family members. The findings also showed that youth do not favor the intervention of officials because they believe that this will cause bad reputation to the family.",,2013,32,4,1,True,,654,7889782,Tadios Chisango,7466796,T.

However, there have been limited studies exploring the beliefs that specific sub-populations, such as religious groups, have about sexual violence. A central objective of this study was to provide a better understanding of student needs in order to assist administrators and student service professionals as they offer support for students in Christian higher education settings. This study was a comprehensive, exploratory survey into the attitudes and perceptions of rape myth acceptance, sexism, authoritarianism, violence, and safety, as well as occurrence of sexual violence, among Christian college students at a mid-Atlantic Christian university was conducted.

654,An investigation of the sexist application of the morality concept of Tsika in the Shona culture of Zimbabwe.,"We investigated the sexist application of a morality concept of Tsika, characterized by communal traits, in the Shona culture of Zimbabwe. Tsika has been defined as ""politeness, civility and circumlocution"" (Samkange & Samkange, 1980, p. 74), thus generally falling under communal traits. Theoretical literature suggests that although Tsika is a cultural ideal for all Shona people, it is especially expected of women and children, and that women can be punished like children if they lack Tsika. This research tested whether Tsika would be expected more of women (and children) than men. In line with ambivalent sexism theory, it was predicted that, because Tsika is constituted of communal traits, a bias in its expectation of women over men would be predicted by benevolent sexism. Furthermore, the research tested whether women (and children) would be judged more negatively than men if they defaulted on Tsika. It was hypothesized that a more negative evaluation of women than men if they defaulted on Tsika would be predicted by hostile sexism. Results confirmed that Tsika is expected more of women than of men. Benevolent sexism and its interaction with hostile sexism predicted the bias in expectation of Tsika of women over men. Results also confirmed that women who default on Tsika are evaluated more negatively than men.

656,Does Gender Inequity Increase the Risk of Intimate Partner Violence among Women? Evidence from a National Bangladeshi Sample,"Background Evidence from developing countries regarding the association between gender inequity and intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in women has been suggestive but inconclusive. Using nationally representative population-based data from Bangladesh, we examined the association between multidimensional aspects of gender inequity and the risk of IPV. Methods We used data from the 2007 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey. The analyses were based on the responses of 4,467 married women. The main explanatory variable was gender inequity, which reflects the multidimensional aspects of women's autonomy and the relationship inequality between women and their partner. The experience of physical and/or sexual IPV was the main outcome variable of interest. Results Over 53% of married Bangladeshi women experienced physical and/or sexual violence from their husbands. In the adjusted models, women who had a higher level of autonomy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.48; 99% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.61), a particularly high level of economic-decision-making autonomy (AOR 0.12; 99% CI 0.08–0.17), and a higher level of non-supportive attitudes towards wife beating or raping (AOR 0.61; 99% CI 0.47–0.83) were less likely to report having experienced IPV. Education level, age at marriage, and occupational discrepancy between spouses were also found to be significant predictors of IPV. Conclusions In conclusion, dimensions of gender inequities were significant predictors of IPV among married women in Bangladesh.

Several studies exist on ear dimensions in various populations; however, studies on Indians are sparse and none of these studies have explored the sex discrimination potential of ear morphometric variables. The present study included 300 subjects (150 males and 150 females) in the age range of 18–30 years originating from all over India. A digital anthropometric method was employed to measure ear length and breadth, base of auricle, lobe length and breadth. Further, the physiognomic ear index, lobe attachments and shape of ear were also assessed. The sex discrimination potential of all these variables was also evaluated. The right and left ears were mostly asymmetrical with respect to ear length, ear breadth, base of auricle. The ear length, breadth and base of auricle were larger in males than females while lobe length and breadth were larger in females as compared with males (chi square test, p ⩽ 0.001).

659,Negatively-Marked MCQ Assessments That Reward Partial Knowledge Do Not Introduce Gender Bias Yet Increase Student Performance and Satisfaction and Reduce Anxiety,"Multiple-choice question (MCQ) examinations are increasingly used as the assessment method of theoretical knowledge in large class-size modules in many life science degrees. MCQ-tests can be used to objectively measure factual knowledge, ability and high-level learning outcomes, but may also introduce gender bias in performance dependent on topic, instruction, scoring and difficulty. The ‘Single Answer’ (SA) test is often used in which students choose one correct answer, in which they are unable to demonstrate partial knowledge. Negatively marking eliminates the chance element of guessing but may be considered unfair. Elimination testing (ET) is an alternative form of MCQ, which discriminates between all levels of knowledge, while rewarding demonstration of partial knowledge. Comparisons of performance and gender bias in negatively marked SA and ET tests have not yet been performed in the life sciences. Our results show that life science students were significantly advantaged by answering the MCQ test in elimination format compared to single answer format under negative marking conditions by rewarding partial knowledge of topics. Importantly, we found no significant difference in performance between genders in either cohort for either MCQ test under negative marking conditions. Surveys showed that students generally preferred ET-style MCQ testing over SA-style testing. Students reported feeling more relaxed taking ET MCQ and more stressed when sitting SA tests, while disagreeing with being distracted by thinking about best tactics for scoring high. Students agreed ET testing improved their critical thinking skills. We conclude that appropriately-designed MCQ tests do not systematically discriminate between genders. We recommend careful consideration in choosing the type of MCQ test, and propose to apply negative scoring conditions to each test type to avoid the introduction of gender bias. The student experience could be improved through the incorporation of the elimination answering methods in MCQ tests via rewarding partial and full knowledge.",PLoS ONE,2013,24,16,1,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is concluded that appropriately-designed MCQ tests do not systematically discriminate between genders, and students were significantly advantaged by answering the MCQ test in elimination format compared to single answer format under negative marking conditions by rewarding partial knowledge of topics.'}",661,119755267,C.

662,Costly Mistakes: Undertaxed Business Owners and Overtaxed Workers,"This article advocates for fundamental changes in the federal income tax base by systematically challenging conventional understandings of consumption and investment. As signaled by our title, “Costly Mistakes,” our thesis has to do exclusively with the deductibility of expenditures by business owners and workers. Where the current tax law treats a business owner’s expenditure as investment, we sometimes find consumption and question why the law should allow the expenditure to be deducted. Where the tax law treats a worker’s expenditure as consumption, we sometimes find investment and question why the law does not allow at least a partial deduction. Through an historical analysis of the development of the modern tax law with special attention to Justice Cardozo’s 1933 U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Welch v. Helvering and a review of Welch’s judicial and legislative progeny, the article demonstrates that the deference the tax law traditionally has accorded business owners results in their being undertaxed. Through an analysis of the tax law’s treatment of workers, it further shows how its structural and substantive rules treat workers primarily as consumers, rather than as producers, and why that results in their being overtaxed. The article then investigates the economic inefficiencies produced by the tax law’s generous treatment of business owners’ outlays and its unduly restrictive treatment of workers’ outlays. It goes on to suggest an analytical framework for scrutinizing and reforming the tax treatment of workers and how that same framework could be extended to business owners with far-reaching implications. Finally, the article relates the undertaxation of business owners and the overtaxation of workers to the broader social policy discussions concerning the high rate of unemployment in the private sector and the escalating deficits in the public sector. It concludes that the success of the U.S. economy in the twenty-first century requires the tax law to treat both business owners and workers as producers. It further concludes that the tax law’s continuing failure to acknowledge that business owners and workers are both consumers and producers undermines the goals of efficiency and fairness.",,2012,19,1,0,False,,664,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,News

We propose to derive hypotheses from discrimination theory, social and human capital theory, and the signaling approach. In a survey we sampled scholars from mathematics, law and sociology who had completed their Habilitation (“second book”) from 1985 and 2005 at West German universities. A young age at the time of completion of the Habilitation is beneficial across all disciplines. In sociology, the number of publications included in the Science Citation Index is the most important factor in attaining a chair, and women are at an advantage when they face the same conditions as do men. In the field of law, parents’ years of education have a significant impact on success, as has having a highly respected mentor. In mathematics, the chances of getting a professorship increase significantly with high occupational prestige of the parents, the share of time spent in research, the specialty of applied mathematics, or having a mentor with a high reputation.

In Experiment 1 male and female faces were shown together with behaviour descriptions of cheating, altruistic, and neutral behaviour. Previous results have led to the hypothesis that people preferentially remember schema-atypical information. Given the common gender stereotype that women are kinder and less egoistic than men, this atypicality account would predict that source memory (that is, memory for the type of context to which a face was associated) should be enhanced for female cheaters in comparison to male cheaters. The results of Experiment 1 confirmed this hypothesis. Experiment 2 reveals that source memory for female faces associated with disgusting behaviours is enhanced in comparison to male faces associated with disgusting behaviours.

While the subject positions that the Master of Business Administration students occupied were rather normative in nature, the article argues that images can be used as a helpful tool to allow reflection on normativity in relation to gender in leadership development.

However, less is known about psychopathy among nonincarcerated individuals and the relation between the two constructs has not been empirically examined among college perpetrators. To address this gap, both constructs were measured in a sample (N = 308) of college men. Rape myth acceptance was positively correlated with psychopathy, and perpetrators scored higher on both constructs. Myths transferring responsibility to victims were related to Factor 1 psychopathy (i.e., callous and manipulative traits). The myth that “rape is trivial” was associated with Factor 1 and Factor 2 (i.e., impulsive and antisocial behavior), possibly suggesting that this myth is related to a larger tendency to excuse aggressive behavior. Although both constructs distinguished perpetrators when considered individually, rape myth acceptance did not explain unique variance in the presence of psychopathy.",,2013,41,60,6,False,,674,47689546,B.

673,"The dimensional structure of people's fears, threats, and concerns and their relationship with right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation.","Most theories addressing the topic have proposed that threat and fear underlie right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and many empirical findings have been consistent with this proposition. Important questions, however, remain unanswered, such as whether RWA is associated with fear and threat in general or only specific kinds of fear and threat. Theories of RWA generate markedly different predictions on this issue, particularly with respect to social or personal fears, and whether the association would also hold for the closely related construct of social dominance orientation (SDO). We investigated the issue by asking 463 undergraduate students to rate their feelings of fear, concern, and anxiety to a comprehensive 93-item list of potential fears and threats, which were formulated as either personal or social. Exploratory factors analysis identified five distinct fear-threat factors: harm to self, child, or country; personal and relationship failures; environmental and economic fears; political and personal uncertainties; and threats to ingroup. All the fear-threat factors were correlated with RWA, with the strongest correlations being for threats to ingroup, and with stronger effects for social than for personal fears. None of the fear factors correlated with SDO. These relationships were not affected by controlling for social desirability or emotional stability (EMS). When the intercorrelations between fear factors and EMS were controlled using ridge regression, only threats to ingroup predicted RWA. Structural equation modeling indicated good fit for a model in which low levels of EMS had a significant path to threats to ingroup, which in turn had a significant path to RWA, and EMS having a significant though weak indirect (fully mediated) inverse effect on RWA.

681,What Motivates the Sexual Double Standard? More Support for Male Versus Female Control Theory,"The present research uniquely compared male control theory (MCT) versus female control theory (FCT) to illuminate motives for the sexual double standard (SDS), whereby men gain status from engaging in casual sex or having many sexual partners, but women are stigmatized for it. Consistent with MCT, men were more likely than women to endorse the SDS and to give sexual advice in ways that reinforce it—gender differences that were mediated by hostile sexism (HS) and endorsing the SDS, respectively. The data did not support FCT’s argument that women are motivated by sexual economics to restrict female sexuality (Baumeister & Twenge, 2002). Both genders discouraged women from having casual sex to protect women from social stigma and rape myths that justify violence against sexual women.

684,“Nothing Short of a Horror Show”: Triggering Abjection of Street Workers in Western Canadian Newspapers,"Over the past decade, Canadian media coverage of street sex work has steadily increased. The majority of this interest pertains to graphic violence against street sex workers, most notably from Vancouver, British Columbia. In this article, the authors analyze newspaper coverage that appeared in western Canadian publications between 2006 and 2009. In theorizing the violence both depicted and perpetrated by newspapers, the authors propose an analytic framework capable of attending to the process of othering in all of its complexity. To this end, the authors supplement a Foucauldian analysis of abjection by considering the work of Judith Butler along with Julia Kristeva's conceptualization of abjection. Using excerpts from western Canadian newspapers, the authors illustrate how the media's discursive practices function as triggers for the process of cultural abjection by inscribing street sex workers with images of defilement. The authors argue that newspaper coverage of street sex workers reinforces the inviolability of normalized life by constantly reiterating the horror reserved for abjected bodies.",Hypatia,2013,52,11,2,False,,686,65922796,D.

685,Psychological values as protective factors against sexist attitudes in preadolescents.,"BACKGROUND
Sexist attitudes are one of the factors that justify domestic violence. Positive psychology can provide keys to prevent sexist violence at an early age. Psychological values are a group of psychological strengths in a person's development. They provide important clues for the prevention of gender-based violence.


METHOD
This study presents an assessment of two groups of variables, sexist attitudes and beliefs and psychological values, in a sample of 449 (213 boys and 236 girls) preadolescents from various schools (mean age: 12). We analyze the relationship between these variables. We used the Values in Action Inventory (VIA-Y), the Questionnaire of Attitudes towards Diversity and Violence (CADV) and the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI).


RESULTS
The results show that sexism variables are related to each other and negatively to the psychological values in boys and girls.

It explores how mental health nurses, and men convicted of sexual offences who also have a diagnosis of personality disorder, talked about pornography and sexual crime in the context of forensic provision. Access to sexually-explicit media, in relation to treatment environments for people convicted of sexual offences, has become a cause for professional and political concern in the UK. Data collection and analysis, undertaken concurrently, were informed by a discursive design. Semistructured interviews, as co-constructed accounts with nursing staff and detained patients, were audio-taped and transcribed. Data were coded to identify the discursive repertoires, or collective talk, of respondents. In contrast to empirical inquiry into pornography and sexual violence, methodology shifted attention from measurement to meaning, and situated research in a clinical domain. The findings focus on performative language use, where talk about pornography textured the treatment environment, contributed to an overtly masculine discourse, framed the ward as male space, and promoted gendered inequality.

The variation in (i) and (ii) cannot be explained by any form of conscious discrimination such as taste-based or statistical discrimination. Moreover, we show that oppositional identity players do not differ in their behaviour from other players along several dimensions related to aggressiveness and style of play providing further evidence that this is not statistical discrimination.",,2013,30,27,2,False,,692,2075138649,Ina Kerner,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
691,The “Wages of Burman-ness:” Ethnicity and Burman Privilege in Contemporary Myanmar,"Abstract Ethnicity is one of the primary lenses through which scholars view conflict in Burma/Myanmar. In this paper I examine the dominance of the majority ethnic group in Myanmar, the Burmans, and the ways in which Burman-ness functions as a privileged identity. I draw from the theoretical framework of Whiteness and White privilege in critical race theory to argue that, although there are important analytical differences between race and ethnicity, we can conceptualise Burman-ness as a form of institutionalised dominance similar to Whiteness. I support this argument by documenting the ways in which Burmans are privileged in relation to non-Burmans, while still, in many cases, seeing themselves as equally subject to government repression. This analysis of Burman privilege (and blindness to that privilege) is particularly relevant given the fact that the political reforms implemented by Myanmar's new, partly civilian government since 2011 have opened new opportunities for (mostly Burman) activists while coinciding with increased military violence in some non-Burman border regions of the country.",,2013,81,99,6,False,,693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jennifer Higginbotham makes a persuasive case for a paradigm shift in our current conceptions of the early modern sex-gender system. She challenges the widespread assumption that the category of the 'girl' played little or no role in the construction of gender in early modern English culture. And she demonstrates that girl characters appeared in a variety of texts, from female infants in Shakespeare's late romances to little children in Tudor interludes to adult 'roaring girls' in city comedies. This monograph provides the first book-length study of the way the literature and drama of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries constructed the category of the 'girl'. It charts the emergence of the word 'girl' into early modern English and its evolution from a gender-neutral term applied to both male and female children to one used only for female individuals. It challenges the misconception that girls were largely absent from English Renaissance literature. It offers a literary history of female child characters in Renaissance drama, from Tudor interludes to the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries to later seventeenth-century closet dramas.

However, right-wing LGBTQ+ identities remain seemingly paradoxical, as right-wing Christianity-rooted conservatism is generally hostile to LGBTQ+ empowerment. Grounded in literature on populist radical right and its relationship with religion and sexuality, as well as social identity theory, we argue that right-wing LGBTQ+ people resolve identity tension by creating a positive group image. Analysing over 2,500 posts on a prominent (new/alt/populist) right-wing LGBTQ+ Reddit community, r/RightWingLGBT, we found right-wing LGBTQ+ users maintain a positive self-identity by positioning themselves against ‘degenerate, liberal, non-binary queers’, thus limiting themselves to narrow iterations of acceptable queerness which are congruent with hetero- and cis-normativity. Islam replaces Christianity as the primary anti-LGBTQ+ outgroup, which, alongside a normalisation and naturalisation of religious-rooted moral selves, helps to reconcile LGBTQ+ identities and right-wing populism and establish homonationalism as a bottom-up phenomenon.",Identities,2022,37,3,0,True,,704,3625446,C.

708,A Question of Control? Examining the Role of Control Conditions in Experimental Psychopathology using the Example of Cognitive Bias Modification Research,"Abstract While control conditions are vitally important in research, selecting the optimal control condition can be challenging. Problems are likely to arise when the choice of control condition is not tightly guided by the specific question that a given study aims to address. Such problems have become increasingly apparent in experimental psychopathology research investigating the experimental modification of cognitive biases, particularly as the focus of this research has shifted from theoretical questions concerning mechanistic aspects of the association between cognitive bias and emotional vulnerability, to questions that instead concern the clinical efficacy of ‘cognitive bias modification’ (CBM) procedures. We discuss the kinds of control conditions that have typically been employed in CBM research, illustrating how difficulties can arise when changes in the types of research questions asked are not accompanied by changes in the control conditions employed. Crucially, claims made on the basis of comparing active and control conditions within CBM studies should be restricted to those conclusions allowed by the specific control condition employed. CBM studies aiming to establish clinical utility are likely to require quite different control conditions from CBM studies aiming to illuminate mechanisms. Further, conclusions concerning the clinical utility of CBM interventions cannot necessarily be drawn from studies in which the control condition has been chosen to answer questions concerning mechanisms. Appreciating the need to appropriately alter control conditions in the transition from basic mechanisms-focussed investigations to applied clinical research could greatly facilitate the translational process.",The Spanish Journal of Psychology,2017,46,50,2,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The kinds of control conditions that have typically been employed in CBM research are discussed, illustrating how difficulties can arise when changes in the types of research questions asked are not accompanied byChanges in the control conditions employed.'}",710,1885803,S.

709,"Gait velocity (walking speed) is an indicator of spine health, and objective measure of pre and post intervention recovery for spine care providers.","© Journal of Spine Surgery. All rights reserved. Walking is a fundamental part of living dependent on the function and interaction of the visual, mechanical and neurological health of the individual (1). Its importance is not limited by age, race or medical status. Reduced walking speed, or gait velocity (GV) is a sign of advancing age, poor response to rehabilitation, age-related diseases, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and early mortality (2). A deterioration in how we walk, including reduced GV, is associated with poor health outcomes, including spinal health (3). GV is of such importance that it has been dubbed “the 6 vital sign” (1). There is nominal literature linking walking metrics, including GV, with assessment of disability and post intervention recovery of the spine patient. Walking serves as an important objective measure of our spine health, free of the subjective bias inherent in patient reported outcome measures (4). The importance of GV is well documented for general health outcomes, however is now gaining increased interest in the spine arena. This includes: (I) Lumbar spinal stenosis (4-6). A number of articles have recently documented the use of GV as powerful metric in the assessment of the patient with Lumbar Spinal Stenosis, and identified this metric as a relevant tool for the objective measurement of outcome and recovery. (II) Lumbar disc herniation (7). There is a significant correlation between gait parameters including GV, and functional disability in patients with Lumbar Disc Herniation. However, data is lacking on the use of this metric for post intervention recover following microdiscectomy, and this requires further investigation. (III) Identification of complications post spinal surgery (8). Wearable devices measuring gait, including GV, have been used not only as a research tool, but in the remote monitoring of patients’ post-surgery for continuous assessment of recovery. There is a case report of remote monitoring to identify a complication post microdiscectomy with patient contact for relevant imaging and further intervention. This is a landmark publication and reveals the future of smart devices to assist in the automation of patient management. (IV) Low back pain (9). Pain intensity can negatively affect spatiotemporal gait parameters, in particular GV, in patients with Low Back Pain, such as discogenic or facetogenic pain generators.

711,The Behavioral Foundations of Public Policy,"In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in behavioral research on a wide variety of topics, from behavioral finance, labor contracts, philanthropy, and the analysis of savings and poverty, to eyewitness identification and sentencing decisions, racism, sexism, health behaviors, and voting. Research findings have often been strikingly counterintuitive, with serious implications for public policymaking. In this book, leading experts in psychology, decision research, policy analysis, economics, political science, law, medicine, and philosophy explore major trends, principles, and general insights about human behavior in policy-relevant settings. Their work provides a deeper understanding of the many drivers--cognitive, social, perceptual, motivational, and emotional--that guide behaviors in everyday settings. They give depth and insight into the methods of behavioral research, and highlight how this knowledge might influence the implementation of public policy for the improvement of society. This collection examines the policy relevance of behavioral science to our social and political lives, to issues ranging from health, environment, and nutrition, to dispute resolution, implicit racism, and false convictions. The book illuminates the relationship between behavioral findings and economic analyses, and calls attention to what policymakers might learn from this vast body of groundbreaking work. Wide-ranging investigation into people's motivations, abilities, attitudes, and perceptions finds that they differ in profound ways from what is typically assumed. The result is that public policy acquires even greater significance, since rather than merely facilitating the conduct of human affairs, policy actually shapes their trajectory.",,2013,39,361,18,False,,713,70321120,Shulamit Almog,,,,,,,,,,,Engineering,
712,"Postfeminism, hybrid mumpreneur identities and the reproduction of masculine entrepreneurship","Mobilising postfeminism as an analytical device, this article re-examines how women business owners discursively engage with the identity of the mumpreneur. Drawing on interviews with women business owners, this article reconceptualises the compatibility between motherhood and entrepreneurship associated with the mumpreneur, in terms of a hybrid identity that interlinks feminine and masculine behaviours connected to home and work. Study data reveal the discursive practices present in interview accounts – choosing family and work, strategic mumpreneurship and enhancing the business without limits – which draw on postfeminist discourses to constitute hybrid entrepreneurial femininities associated with the mumpreneur category. The article contributes to the gender and entrepreneurship literature, in particular, the scholarship on mumpreneurship, by first, showing how engagement with the mumpreneur identity is implicated in the reproduction of masculine entrepreneurship; second, demonstrates how encounters with the mumpreneur contribute to the creation of a hierarchy of entrepreneurial identities which reinforces the masculine norm; and third considers how the mumpreneur as a hybrid identity mobilises entrepreneurship in children in gendered ways. While the emergence of the mumpreneur as a contemporary entrepreneurial identity has positively impacted how women’s entrepreneurship is viewed, the study demonstrates that it has not disrupted dominant discourses of masculine entrepreneurship or gendered power relations in the entrepreneurial field.",International Small Business Journal,2021,78,9,0,True,,714,117366945,David Cowan,145186122,Daniel Wincott,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

Information from focus groups was included to provide a context for the empirical data. Results indicated that overall the girls were hopeful, with a mean score of 135 (SD = 18.2) out of a possible score of 168. Correlation and regression procedures revealed a statistically significant negative relationship between hopefulness and exposure to violence. No significant relationship was found between anger and hopefulness. Fear of violence was positively related to exposure to violence but did not appear related to anger or hopefulness. The findings were mixed and did not capture the kind of hopelessness and anger which often appear in the literature describing children growing up in urban environments.

723,THE ACCESSIBILITY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN SPORTS TOURISM-A MATTER OF CONCERN,"Literature review Quality of life is a major issue for people with physical disabilities (Card, Cole & Humphrey, 2006). Tourism is one segment of society that has the potential for improving the quality of life for individuals with physical disabilities (Shi et al., 2012). For disabled people the vacations and the journey are an important part of their life as a means in order to escape from their daily routine, to strengthen family ties and to promote health, self-confidence and independence (Blichfeldt&Nicolaisen, 2011).Their participation in physical activities, in exercise and recreation programs, as also in competitive sports becomes beneficial. (Theodorakis, 2010). According to Rimmer (2004), while exercise seems to be a universal recommendation for maintaining good health, for people with disabilities, options for exercise may be seriously limited by a lack of accessible equipment and facilities, a lack of information about what type of exercise is best for them or the severity of their physical impairment itself. Researches in accessible tourism have shown that disabled people face many obstacles when they participate in sport and recreation activities due to the lack of accessible destinations, facilities, means of transport, appropriate information and because of obstacles in communication and behavior (Blichfeldt&Nicolaisen, 2011; Figueiredo et al, 2012), but also in finding an accessible accommodation (Darcy, 2010). Aim of the paper The purpose of this study was to determine whether the ATAS questionnaire fits in the Greek context and to investigate a) the dimensions of sport tourists’ accessibility as regards tourist accommodation, sport facilities and b) the dimensions of their own needs. Methodology Sample: The sample was consisted by 81 sport tourists with disabilities at the age of 18 and above, men and women, with physical and sensory 1 of 4 Abstract Reviewer E A S M 2 01 4 disabilities (vision or hearing disabilities) participated in this research. Questionnaire: The questionnaire was consisted of the scale Accessible Tourism Accommodation SurveyATAS which is about the accommodation needs of disabled people based on the accessibility with 2 questions concerning the dimensions of access and the independence of a traveller, 64 questions concerning the accommodation attributes (adding 9 questions regarding sport facilities), 17 questions concerning the accommodation type and 50 questions concerning the travel patterns. Since the ATAS questionnaire measures accommodation accessibility primarily, concerning the accommodation attributes of the ATAS questionnaire we added 7 questions in order to measure alongside the accessibility of sport facilities (facility with an accessible hot tub or whirlpool, trained fitness instructors in helping individuals with disabilities to participate at sports/recreation programs, suitable sports equipment for individuals with disabilities is provided, sports/recreation programs that allow persons with disabilities to participate, facility with an accessible sauna or steam room, trained personnel in helping individuals with disabilities, professional support and training in the facility).We also added 2 questions (Rooms on lower floors, bathroom door that opens outward), regarding accommodation attributes and sport facilities, after conversation with people with physical and sensory disabilities, users of disabled rooms, who answered the questionnaire and were recruited to product test the accessible accommodation. On the other hand, it was consisted of the Tourist Role Preference Scale of Gibson and Yiannakis (2002), translated by Yfantidou, Costa and Michalopoulou (2008) with 22 questions regarding the human needs, but it was also consisted of a part of 10 questions regarding demographics and specific preference destination. Process: The research was conducted in four towns of Northern Greece (Alexandroupolis, Komotini, Thessaloniki, Naoussa). It was carried contact and cooperation with the National Sports Federation for people with disabilities, disability organizations, sports clubs, hotels, outdoor activity companies and camps. 150 questionnaires were distributed in Greek and English edition, while 81 questionnaires were returned. The vast majority of participants (90.1%) were domestic tourists, 7.4% of participants were residentsof Serbia and 2.5% residents of Germany.The forms of sport tourism they were participating in were powerlifting, wheelchair basketball, swimming, wheelchair rugby, blind chess and football. Results The exploratory factor analysis using the method of principal components analysis for the ATAS scale revealed 6 factors that explain 59,149% of the total variance:1) Core Mobility(a=.903), 2) Hearing & Vision (Communication)(a=.850), 3) Ambulant (Safety)(a=.875), 4) Service & Security(a=.863),5) Amenity (comfort/recreation)(a=.895),6) Supplementary Mobility (a =.925)and for the TRPS revealed five factorsof needs that explained 57,977% of the total variance: 1) need for self-esteem and recognition from the others(a=.857), 2)normal needs 2 of 4 Abstract Reviewer E A S M 2 01 4 (a=.780), 3) need for love (a=.579), 4) need for selffulfillment,selfacting and self –development(&#945;=.633), 5)need for safety (a=.661).It was used Manova analysis between the age and the gender in relation to psychological needs and to accommodation attributes. As regards the psychological needs, data have shown a statistically significant effect of the gender on the second factor of needs F(1,76)=7,368, p<0,05 among men (Mean=4,193) and women (Mean=2,781). As regards accommodation attributes, data have shown a statistically significant main effect of the gender on the second factor residence “Hearing and Vision” (Contact) F(1,76)=5,398, p<0,05, among men (Mean=2,418) and among women (Mean=4,193). Also between “Hearing and Vision” and the age F(2,76)=4,358, p<0,05, where it was found a statistically significant difference in the age of groups of 17-39 years old (Mean=3,280) and 4059 years old (Mean=4,040), in relation to the age 60 years and over (Mean=1,000). Moreover, there was a statistically significant main effect of the age on the fourth factor accommodation “Services and Security” F(2,76)=8,872, p<0,05,where it was found a statistically significant difference in the age groups of 17-39 years old (Mean=3,821) and 40-59 years old (Mean=4,444) in relation to the age of group 60 years and over (Mean=1,000), but also on the fifth factor residence “Comfort and Recreation” F(2,76)=8,032, p<0,05, where it was found a statistically significant difference in the age of 17-39 (Mean=3,808) and in the age of 40-59 years old (Mean=4,178),in relation to the age of group of 60 years old and over (Mean=1,083). Discussion and conclusions The data have shown that sports tourists with disabilities over 60 years old do not consider accommodation attributes relating to factors as referred above (e.g. Alternative format guest information, non-slip bathroom floor, gym with access provision, a positive ‘can do’ customer service attitude, etc.) as important as tourists of smaller age groups. As they were doing the same activities as the younger cohorts, the above pointing out raises questions according to satisfaction or not aboutthe needs and desires of tourists in recent decades and the possible existence of previous negative or positive experiences. The last 30 years in Greece with the introduction of legislation has been noted progress in removing barriers of accessibility, so that today tourism sectors such as transport, accommodation, attractions are accessible to a greater extent compared to the past, which probably justifies the difference noted between older and younger age participants. In conclusion, all the data compose a challenge for the sports industry to design and redesign sport tourism products and services by taking into account the needs and desires of this different class of tourists while providing more opportunities for travelling and exercising in an environment without restrictions and barriers, showing respect to diversity.

In this talk, I want to examine how this tendency is perpetuated by a single-axis framework that is dominant in antidiscrimination law and that is also reflected in feminist theory and antiracist politics. I will center Black women in this analysis in order to contrast the multidimensionality of Black women's experience with the single-axis analysis that distorts these experiences. Not only will this juxtaposition reveal how Black women are theoretically erased, it will also illustrate how this framework imports its own theoretical limitations that undermine efforts to broaden feminist and an-",,1989,9,11651,890,True,,726,113586344,M.

726,"Triple jeopardy: The impact of race, class, and gender on girls and women in sport and physical activity.","Thirty-six million youth athletes participate in and benefit from sport each year in the United States. Along with developing sport skills, the lifelong benefits of physical activity for girls and women are significant and include improved dietary habits and quality sleep, decreased risk for breast cancer and osteoporosis, among other benefits (Erickson et al., 2019; Zarrett et al., 2018). In addition, girls and women that engage in sport are more likely to experience additional professional benefits with 94% of women business executives reporting they played sport in their youth (Kotschwar, 2014). However, as in many performance domains, the benefits are not experienced equally by all would-be participants. Research indicates that girls and women of color do not have the same access to quality sport and physical activity opportunities (National Collegiate Athletic Association [NCAA], 2021; Smith-Evans et al., 2014). In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the eruption of racial unrest have widened the participation gaps and the resulting psychosocial and health benefit gap for girls of color and those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The purpose of this article is to signify the important role sport and physical activity play in socioemotional development, physical fitness, and health of girls and women. By centering the experiences of girls and women who are currently not equitably served by the existing youth sport environment (e.g., girls and women of color and girls from working-class backgrounds), the authors will identify barriers that prevent access to physical activity opportunities for everyone. In addition, strategies for change will be offered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",Psychological services,2022,0,0,0,False,,728,48044622,C. Bepko,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

However, less attention has been paid to how digital technologies are changing contemporary workplaces and how workers are responding to these changes. This article reviews recent research from the multidisciplinary comparative employment relations field, with a focus on institutional resilience or change associated with digitalization; and the strategic responses of unions and other worker representatives to these trends. We find that the insights of economists, sociologists and employment relations scholars are complementary, as each addresses a different dimension of technological change and associated worker outcomes. Comparative employment relations researchers are more likely to influence current debates where they both articulate the unique contribution of their multi-method and comparative research methods and aggregate findings beyond single or paired industry and national case studies.",Journal of Industrial Relations,2022,107,5,0,False,,733,83196961,E.

738,Sex Genes: A Critical Sociomaterial Approach to the Politics and Molecular Genetics of Sex Determination,"H ow should the social sciences engage with the materiality of “nature”? The literatures of both the social studies of science and gender studies have wrestled with this question in their analyses of the production of scientific knowledge. In examining the production or consumption of scientific knowledge, these literatures have demonstrated how production and consumption are social and cultural activities. Within this shared terrain, however, many differences emerge both within and between these two literatures on the questions of how to theorize about the social in the scientific and about the scientific in the social, and how to create a language that does not separate science from society. One topic explored has been the biological explanations for differences between males and females. Biologists and social scientists have proposed explanations for behavioral differences, and debates abound. In this article I do not discuss theories of or data on behavioral differences. Instead, I explore research on the material production of males and females in molecular genetic research on sex determination. I address the question of how the social sciences should engage with the materiality of nature—in this case, the molecular genetics of sex determination. I employ a critical sociomaterial approach to social scientific engagements with the biological sciences. The sociomaterial approach encompasses the poststructuralist view that meanings are not inherent in events, phenomena, and things.

740,Science faculty’s subtle gender biases favor male students,"Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants’ preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2012,122,2357,89,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'In a randomized double-blind study, science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant, and preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role.'}",742,2149548319,Dong-yun Shin,72204721,M.

744,Surveillance Studies,"This article suggests some basic terms for surveillance analysis. The analysis requires a map and a common language to explain and evaluate its fundamental properties, contexts, and behaviors. Surveillance is neither good nor bad but context and comportment make it so. Topics considered in this article include: a broad definition of surveillance, its strategic and nonstrategic forms, and the traditional and new surveillance. A family of related terms – privacy, publicity, confidentiality, and secrecy – is also considered. The discussion next focuses on characteristics of the social structures that organize behavior, the characteristics of the means used, and some value conflicts and social processes seen with the emergent, interactive character of much surveillance behavior. Queen Elizabeth (1533–1603) introduced modern ideas about the rights of the person including protection against “windows into men’s hearts and secret thoughts.” In this view, she draws on an English proverb: “the eyes are the windows into the soul” that in turn reflects the biblical claim (Matthew 6: 22–23) that probative looking into another’s eyes reveals who they are (questions of deception and validity apart). Queen Elizabeth realized that the dignity of the person requires limits on looking, particularly when coercion and inequality are present, as with state power. Yet as a ruler concerned with the welfare of her subjects she needed information about them, as well as about rule breakers and those who would overthrow her government. Her challenge – juggling the protection of individuals’ hearts and secret thoughts and the protection of state security – is one that faces democratic leaders everywhere. This article suggests some basic terms for surveillance analysis. A map and a common language are required to explain and evaluate its fundamental properties, contexts, and behaviors. The empirical richness of watching and being watched (whether involving the eye or other senses and various kinds of data) and the uses of surveillance results need to be disentangled and parsed into basic categories and dimensions. After offering a brief comment on surveillance studies and a broad definition of surveillance, attention is given to strategic and nonstrategic forms, and traditional and the new forms of surveillance. A family of terms related to surveillance – privacy, publicity, confidentiality, and secrecy – is considered. The discussion next focuses on characteristics of the social structures that organize behavior and the characteristics of the means used and some social processes seen with the emergent, interactive character of much surveillance behavior. I next turn to value conflicts that make surveillance often so controversial. The discussion that follows draws from Marx (2015, and articles at www.garymarx.net) and is informed by the sources in Table 1. What Is Surveillance? Today’s surveillance society, as is involves the state, the private sector, and interpersonal relations, brings forth the same paradox faced by Queen Elizabeth noted in the preceding paragraph – whether the National Security Agency’s worldwide gathering of metadata on telecommunications, or merchants, employers, and parents watching customers, workers, and children, respectively. In a world where surveillance is seen as both a response to threats and a threat, before asking “Is surveillance good or bad?” we need to ask, “What concepts are needed to capture its basic structures and processes?” Surveillance as such is neither good nor bad, but context and comportment do make it so. The same can be said for the related concept Table 1 Surveillance essays: names of the new society and its key aspects The panopticon (Bentham, 1995) Disciplinary society, the gaze and bio-power (Foucault, 1977, 1998) Surveillance society, the new surveillance and maximum security society (Marx, 1985, 2015) Net widening (Cohen, 1985) Dossier society (Laudon, 1986) Dataveillance (Clarke, 1988) Super-panopticon (Poster, 1990) Society of control (Deleuze, 1992) L’anamorphose de l’etat-nation (Palidda, 1992) Panoptic sort (Gandy, 1993) Minimum security society (Blomberg, 1987) Synopticon (Mathiesen, 1997) Securitization (Buzan et al., 1998) Telematic society (Bogard, 1996) Techno-policing (Nogala, 1995) Transparent society (Brin, 1998) The maximum surveillance society (Norris and Armstrong, 1999) Liquid modernity (Bauman, 2000) Information empire (Hardt and Negri, 2001) Surveillant assemblage (Haggerty and Ericson, 2006) Post-panopticon (Boyne, 2000) Glass cage (Gabriel, 2005) Ban-opticon (Bigo, 2006) High policing (Brodeur and Leman-Langlois, 2006) Ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006) Ubereveillance (Michael et al., 2008) Ambient intelligence (Wright et al., 2008) Safe society (Lyon, 2007) Thick and thin surveillance (Torpey, 2007) A representative, although hardly exhaustive, list. International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2nd edition, Volume 23 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.64025-4 733 International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, Second Edition, 2015, 733–741 of privacy. Context refers to the type of institution and organization in question and to the goals, rules, and expectations they are associated with. Comportment refers to the kind of behavior expected (whether based on law or less formal cultural expectations) of, and actually shown by, those in various surveillance roles. While sharing some elements, differences in surveillance contexts involving coercion (government), care (parents and children), contracts (work and consumption) and free-floating accessible personal data (the personal and private within the public) need consideration. Surveillance is a generic process characteristic of living systems with information borders and not something restricted to governments, spying, or secrecy. Surveillance and privacy are not necessarily in opposition and the latter can be a means of insuring the former as with access controls to information. While media attention to the problems associated with inappropriate surveillance (particularly by government) is present, there are also problems associated with the failure to use surveillance when it is appropriate. The emerging interdisciplinary field of surveillance studies analyzes these issues. Surveillance Studies The watchful and potentially wrathful (although also sometimes loving and protective) eye of the Biblical God of the Old Testament offers an early example of surveillance. More modern authors include Hobbes, Rousseau, Bentham, Marx, Nietzsche, Weber, and Taylor. Foucault (1977) (although writing about earlier centuries) is the grandfather of contemporary surveillance studies. The field of surveillance studies came to increased public and academic attention after the events of 9/11 (Monaghan, 2006; Ball et al., 2012). But the topic in its modern form has been of interest to scholars at least since the 1950s. This is related to greater awareness of the human rights abuses of colonialism, fascism, and communism and anti-democratic behavior within democratic societies. The literary work of Huxley, Orwell, and Kafka and the appearance of computers and other new technologies with their profound implications for social behavior, organization, and society are also factors in the field’s development. In the form of the surveillance essay current writers from many disciplines and perspectives (e.g., political economy, social control, law and society, and criminology) draw on and extend the earlier theorists to describe the appearance of a new kind of society with new forms of social ordering (Table 1). As ideal types, the terms in Table 1 such as the ‘panopticon,’ ‘disciplinary society,’ or ‘maximum security society’ combine many strands that need to be separated if we are to move beyond sweeping claims made about surveillance. The concepts discussed in this article seek to bring greater precision and to add some leaves to the trees. One way to do that is to develop a middle range approach that fills out a general concept such as the maximum security society (as well as most of the other broad surveillance society naming concepts in Table 1) by identifying subsocieties that compose the surveillance society. The maximum society concept draws parallels to the total institution and the maximum security prison and suggests that forms of control traditionally associated with the prison are diffusing into the broader society. But as an abstract notion, it does little to analyze variation in surveillance practices and changes over time. To do that the threads of the tapestry must be unwound in a series of subsocieties. Among components of the contemporary surveillance society are: a hard engineered society; a soft and seductive engineered society; a dossier society; an actuarial society; a transparent society; a selfmonitored society; a suspicious society; a networked society of ambient and ubiquitous sensors in constant communication; a safe and secure society with attenuated tolerance for risk and with a strong emphasis on prevention; a ‘who are you society?’ of protean identities, both asserted by and imposed upon individuals; and a ‘where are you, where have you been, and who else is there?’ society of documented mobility, activity, and location. The broad approach of the surveillance essays is important in calling attention to contemporary changes, but such work generally does not take us beyond broad statements, does not adequately define surveillance, nor identify components that would systematically permit differentiating the new from the old forms, or making comparisons between various surveillance uses, contexts, and societies. In offering neither inclusive and nuanced definitions nor adequately elaborating dimensions, they fail to call attention to what is universal in human societies or to offer ways to analyze what is different.

This melodious grieving also conveyed the slaves' loss of their West African political, religious, and family systems which attached importance, sometimes great importance, to the role of the Mothers as well as the Fathers of Civilization. Slaves came from social systems where men and women shared power in various ways, but most often through economic interdependence. The slaves correctly perceived their new life in the United States as a ""war on African familyhood-. . . those expressions and man ifestations of individual/community/national life and organization which emerge from the African world view of relationships between Man, Woman and the Universe.""1 The slaves not only lost their homeland, they also lost a social system whose culture and social organization were guided by the obligations of kinship and whose policies grew out of these obligations. Aspects of the black religious and political experience in the United States reflect elements of this ethic of ""familyhood."" In both sacred and secular community settings, there are powerful and respected older women addressed by the title, ""Mother.""2 In secular settings, such mothers are often the heads of black women's organizations and hold positions of power and authority in more broadly based community and civil rights organizations.

The study is a qualitative case study of one secondary school. Data were collected from two Grade 11 isiZulu teachers from two schools. Semi-structured interviews and lesson observations were used as data collection tools. A semi-structured interview and an observation schedule were developed as research instruments. Content analysis was used for the analysis of six literary texts selected from different genres. Pharr's (1988) theory of oppression was employed for the analysis of data collected from interviews, observations and literary texts. One of the findings of the study is that both males and females are stereotypically represented in the books. For example, women are portrayed as nurturers, housewives, dependent, and uneducated. On the other hand, men are portrayed as heads of families, independent, successful, artful, business-minded, strong, and brave.

A qualitative study of five selected soccer clubs which are members of a German regional soccer association reveals that informal and personal decision-making practices still play a fundamental role in the recruitment of coaches. These practices undermine formal guidelines and give disproportionate weight to stereotyped preferences in the recruitment of soccer coaches. In this context, decision-makers’ (functionaries’) professed support of women largely serves a symbolic purpose and creates an illusion of equality concerning decisions that have already been taken at an informal level.",,2013,98,15,0,True,,781,14718728,K.

779,THE IMPACT OF LONGITUDINAL STEM CAREERS INTRODUCING INTERVENTION ON STUDENTS´ CAREER ASPIRATIONS AND ON RELATING OCCUPATIONAL IMAGES,"Background: A major professionals replacement demand due to an aging trend among STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) occupational fields has been recognised in several European Union countries. However, research has shown that adolescents are not aspiring to such careers. One possible cause has been students´ low awareness of STEM career opportunities and their work characteristics. One solution to this has been suggested as embedding career education into science teaching at school thus raising students´ awareness of possible STEM careers and shaping their stereotypical images of STEM occupations and hence attitude towards studying science. Purpose: The study aims to determine the effects of embedding STEM career education into science teaching on a) students´ career aspirations, and b) on their occupational images in STEM fields, in terms of students´ perceptions of competency requirements for STEM careers and for their career aspirations. Methodology: The current study followed a longitudinal pre-post-test control-group design. The experimental group (EG) students (N=77), from three schools, were studying different science topics during their 7th— 9th grade through five career introducing learning modules, each following a 3-stage model (Holbrook & Rannikmae, 2010) i.e. a contextualisation stage for inducing motivation; a de-contextualisation stage for learning conceptual science with inquiry or hands on activities; a re-contextualisation stage for socio-scientific decision making, reflecting on the learning and applying it to the initial context. The EG students were introduced to different careers within the learning contexts of solar panel mobile charger; lemonade production in a factory; city planning or murder investigation; oil spill clean-up and endangered species protection with CITES. The control group (CG) (N=21) learned science with approaches chosen by their teachers. Data prior and after the intervention was collected by using a paper and pencil questionnaire, which contained 3 parts: 1. students´ career aspirations; 2. and 3. students´ opinions of the importance of various competences on a 4-point scale (not important at all- 1, to very important- 4 ) for (a) their career aspirations and (b) for STEM careers. The list of competences (n=26) used in the questionnaire (2nd and 3rd part), were drawn from Jang (2016) and from the work descriptions of science and engineering professionals in the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (International Labour Office, 2012). Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Chi-Square test, Fischers´ Exact test, with Monte Carlo adjustments, to determine changes in career aspirations and Mann-Whitney U-test, with Bonferroni corrections, for determining the changes in students´ perceptions of relevant competencies. Results and conclusions: No statistically significant changes were detected in students´ career aspirations. Interestingly, the EG students indicated significant rise in the importance of several future career competences and for STEM careers. The CG students´ ratings of importance for several competences dropped significantly. The results indicated that students´ career aspirations could not be changed through the intervention, but gave an indication of positive changes in students´ occupational images of STEM careers, which supported embedding career education into science teaching in middle school.",EDULEARN19 Proceedings,2019,27,1,0,False,,782,2188741670,Allifya Fauziah,,,,,,,,,,,,Review

781,European female sport students as future coaches?,"Abstract Female coaches are strongly underrepresented in the world of sport. The role of the female coach has therefore received broad attention from scholars during the last three decades. Theoretical and empirical studies have focused on individual, cultural and structural gender barriers in trying to explain this underrepresentation. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this debate by investigating Norwegian and Czech female sport students’ coaching experiences, the significance of these experiences and their future coaching intentions. Mixed methods were used in the gathering of the data: a questionnaire to 407 female sport students and 19 semi-structured qualitative interviews. More than half of the sport students had coaching experience and 2/3 of them had future coaching intentions. Furthermore, coaching experiences seemed to be of importance for their coaching intentions which may be explained by their positive experiences as coaches. To have a female as a present coach also had a positive influence on coaching intentions. The conclusion focuses on the fact that if the intentions of these female sport students should be realised in the future, the gendered nature and the inhospitable climate of sport have to be changed.",,2013,52,7,1,False,,785,103712658,Amir H.

This paper addresses both theories X and Y of Mc Gregor in economic crisis, where X is the one that might get the poor results focusing on instrumental, physiological values comparing to theory Y where managers are effective leaders with better performance and terminal values promoting self-esteem and actualities. The purpose of this paper is to analyze both theories and determine the effective way to reach the ultimate results. Mc Gregor’s philosophy insists on two fundamental approaches to manage people while combining additional factors other than human nature such as the human relations can play a positive role for effective change. This paper combines a realistic management style to the traditional known autocratic (X) and democratic (Y) styles during economic crisis. Theory X and Y are two different management styles with certain philosophy interpreted by each style manager. They both look at ways and means on how to motivate employees and therefore have a feel of characters of their workers. Each theory tackles its philosophy from its end, for example, theory X believes pushing employees to work by having punishment and rewards can actually be a motivational factor, while theory Y promotes the self-management, self-esteem, management by objective leading to intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.",,2021,0,3,0,True,,790,3445092,Ivelise Fortim,2080964827,C.

790,Attention whore! Perception of female players who identify themselves as women in the communities of MMOs,"Despite the expansion of the gaming industry, its public remains overwhelmingly male in MMOs (Massive Multiplayer Online) games. The objective of this research is to explore the perceptions of players regarding self-identification as women in MMOs .The aim was to know: (i) how women identify themselves online (both as avatars and in virtual communities, such as forums), (ii) if there is fear of being identified as a woman, and (iii) if there are experiences of aggression and / or courtship from male players. The research included an online questionnaire with 21 questions about the experiences of female players that was posted as a link in virtual communities about games. The sample was composed of 120 self-identified Brazilian female players of MMOs with an average age of the players is 22 years. Most of the players were from the Southeast of Brazil, and have played MMOs for 6 to 10 years. Most players said that they have no problem revealing their gender and think that MMO communities are mostly receptive to them. Most of them play with female avatars (89%), and say that the experience is pleasurable (33%); 36% report that they were courted once at least while gaming. Despite reporting that their experiences playing games is pleasurable, there is still a differentiation of treatment for female avatars: 43.5% of the players say they realize their faults are being implicitly assigned to their gender and 38% report having experienced situations in which they were required to date another player. As for the experience of aggression, 23% reported that this has already occurred, but rarely. The results show that although there is no explicit prejudice, women still feel they are not treated as equals.",DiGRA Conference,2013,42,5,1,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results show that although there is no explicit prejudice, women still feel they are not treated as equals in MMOs, and if there are experiences of aggression and / or courtship from male players.'}",794,152914881,M.

793,Increasing Intergroup Cooperation Toward Social Change by Restoring Advantaged and Disadvantaged Groups' Positive Identities,"In this article, we develop a perspective on social change as cooperation between advantaged and disadvantaged groups to facilitate not only redistribution of power and wealth but also restoration of threatened identity dimensions. We argue that disadvantaged groups experience threats to their agency whereas advantaged groups experience threats to their morality. Restoration of these aspects of groups’ identities can unlock the potential for collective action among members of disadvantaged groups and for a greater willingness to change the status quo toward equality among members of advantaged groups. A major theoretical implication of these findings is that social psychological theorizing should pay greater attention to morally based motivations as critical factors in the facilitation of change. A prime practical implication is that interventions designed to improve intergroup relations should consider not only acceptance-related but also agency-related motivations (e.g., through a “common stigmatizers identity” re-categorization strategy).",,2013,120,18,1,False,,797,46758355,Craig Paterson,47602517,E.

The Circle of African Women Theologians has been at the forefront of theologising this crisis, particularly as it affects women. This article seeks to analyse the HIV work of six South African Circle writers namely, Denise Ackermann, Christina Landman, Madipoane Masenya, Sarojini Nadar, Miranda Pillay and Beverley Haddad. The focus of this analysis revolves around the “degrees of separation and practices of solidarity” inherent in their work. The first part of the article deals with each theologian in turn. It then identifies common threads and differences in their work employing the methodological framework of African women’s theology as outlined by Sarojini Nadar and Isabel Phiri. The article concludes with a discussion of the particularities of the South African women’s theological project and argues that the work of these six women does not deal sufficiently with “difference” or “solidarity” thus limiting their influence on the political HIV project.",,2013,15,5,0,False,,799,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,JournalArticle

804,An Autoethnography of Queer Transmasculine Femme Incoherence and the Ethics of Trans Research,"Trans theory (also known as transgender studies) is a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field in which activism, scholarship and lived experience are coalescing around questions of embodiment, personhood, and intersections of race/ethnicity/class/ability/gender/sexuality. Trans-themed research, whether explicitly located in trans theory or not, is a growing area of academic exploration. As a trans researcher and trans person, I am interested in two questions: how does autoethnography fit within trans and queer theory, and how can people who do not live in trans communities undertake ethical trans-related research? A symbolic interactionist perspective informs my understanding of trans theory and the social construction of identity and embodiment. I explore my own femme transmasculinity through autoethnography, and also consider my experience interviewing other trans people as part of researching masculinity. I suggest that researchers who are not trans (who are cisgendered, meaning they identify with the sex/gender they were assigned at birth) must accept that trans people have what Talia Bettcher (2009a, 2009b) terms First Person Authority over their embodiment, experience, and narratives. Having established this, I examine self-identification and intersubjective recognition in relation to my own experience of femme transmasculinity, asking what is femme incoherence and how does this relate to queer and trans theory/politics?",,2013,26,5,1,False,,808,46333010,M.

816,"Fertile Bonds: Bedouin Class, Kinship, and Gender in the Bekaa Valley","With an average of over nine children per family, older cohorts of Bedouin in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon have one of the highest fertility rates in the world. Many married couples in this pastoral community are close relatives--a socially advantageous practice that reflects the deep value Bedouins place on kinship. To outsiders, such family norms can seem disturbing, even premodern. They attract assumptions of Arab ""backwardness,"" poverty, and sexism. Astoundingly, however, Fertile Bonds flips these stereotypes. Anthropological demographer Suzanne Joseph shows that in this particular group, prolific birth rates coincide with moderate death rates and high levels of nutrition. Despite differences in gender, class, and occupation, members of Bekaa Bedouin society rely heavily on kinship ties, sharing, and reciprocity, and experience a high degree of social and demographic equality. This story, unfamiliar to many, is one that is fading as traditional nomadic livelihoods give way to encapsulation within the state. With the help of this surprising, nuanced study--one of the first of its kind in the Middle East--knowledge of such marginalised pastoral groups will not vanish with the disappearance of their way of life. Joseph's book expands our understanding of peoples far removed from consolidated government control and provides a broad analytical lens through which to examine demographic divides across the globe.",,2013,4,2,0,False,,820,118429782,Elonda Clay,,,,,,,,,,,Philosophy,

They address pedagogy, school practices, curricula, and textbooks, as along with single-sex versus coed schooling, dress codes, sex education, Jewish rituals, and gender hierarchies in educational leadership. Drawing a stark picture of the many ways both girls and boys are molded into gender identities, the authors offer concrete resources and suggestions for transforming educational practice.",,2013,29,4,1,False,,822,27065515,Manoochehr Jafarigohar,35738568,E.

Thirty three teachers with minimum one year experience of teaching the two books evaluated them using a checklist of the evaluation of EFL coursebooks. Analysis of the obtained data by t-test showed that the difference between the two coursebooks was statistically significant in some criteria. Teachers were more satisfied with Topnotch than Total English in the criteria such as language components, tasks, activities, exercises, and critical discourse analysis features. On the other hand, they were more satisfied with Total English than the other coursebook in a criterion considered as general considerations. The difference between the two coursebooks was not significant in some criteria including structures, skills, and teacher’s manual. Findings of the study can be beneficial for the authors of the two coursebooks, EFL teachers, curriculum and material developers, administrators of language institutes, and also students interested in learning EFL.",,2013,45,5,1,True,,826,6599632,J.

823,Asia as method in education studies: a defiant research imagination,"importing the civil service examination system from China in 958. This section ends with the introduction of Neo-Confucianism during the transition from Koryŏ to early Chosŏn. Part II begins to introduce the case studies of Andong and Namwŏn to show the “localisation” of the descent groups. Part III explains the application process of newly learned Confucian rituals to local kin groups and how these local elites responded in times of state crisis during the Imjin War (1592–98) and the Manchu Invasions (1627 and 1636–37). Part IV discusses how factionalism affected the relationship between centre and periphery in the seventeenth century and how it influenced the sajok to turn to “local” and to build their “lineage organisation” into maturity. Part V examines the survival strategies of landed elites in times of challenges from newly empowered groups such as secondary sons (sŏja or sŏŏl) and local functionaries (hyangni) due to the shifting socioeconomic environment in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Overall, the author provides an engaging narrative by highlighting the indigenous kinship practices of Korea, including agnatic kinsmen (munjung), local bureaus (yuhyangso), affines, nonagnates, secondary sons, women’s genealogical importance, and the landed elites’ possession of slaves. Although the book is impressive in its detailed analysis and extensive use of primary sources, there are two points that left me puzzled after reading the book. First, the author’s usage of “ideology” is unclear when explaining the practice of kinship. Based on the analysis of kinship practice in Andong and Namwŏn, the book seems to demonstrate the institutional history of the kinship system based on Neo-Confucianism. If it is “kinship ideology” and not the system, the author needs to explain more clearly how that is different from the “Neo-Confucian ideology” she so eloquently argued in her previous book. Second, the author emphasises the importance of “the social”, and states “By putting the social ahead of the political, the indigenous kinship ideology created an elite that ruled on the basis of birth and descent, giving it extraordinary permanence through time and space” (p. 408). No one could argue its importance, but it seems an overstatement to claim that “the social” preceded all other factors in maintaining the hereditary status system. As far as the elite status is concerned, Deuchler makes the indisputable claim that the “native kinship ideology” produced the descent groups that continued to hold elite power and privilege throughout the Chosŏn dynasty. Anyone reading the book will be impressed with Deuchler’s breadth of knowledge, meticulous research, extensive use of primary sources, and detailed analysis of case studies. Since the book covers from Silla to late Chosŏn, one could use it in multiple ways for teaching purposes by assigning different chapters depending on what time period is being covered. The book definitely appeals to a broad audience of scholars and students interested in premodern Korean history, kinship, genealogy, social status and locality. Like her previous book, Under the Ancestors’ Eyes is truly another masterpiece and essential to anyone studying premodern Korean history.",,2017,1,16,2,False,,827,116761391,Kristina Horn Sheeler,114261329,K.

824,Who gains and who loses? Sociodemographic disparities in access to special education services among autistic students,"Little is known about differences in the allocation of special education services to students with autism compared with students with other primary learning differences (e.g., intellectual disability [ID], specific learning disability [SLD]) and the comparative impact of sociodemographic factors on special education service receipt. The present study aimed to compare allocation of services (i.e., quantity and types) between students eligible for special education services under autism, SLD and ID, and to identify differences in sociodemographic predictors (e.g., race, neighborhood income) of service allocation. Data were culled from special education administrative records from a large urban, primarily Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish‐serving school district from academic years 2011–2012 to 2016–2017. Participants included N = 76,428 students (Nautism = 18,151, NSLD = 54,001, NID = 4,276) ages 2–18. Results showed that autistic students received, on average, more services than students with SLD. Services received by students served under autism and SLD eligibility were more congruent with areas of need (e.g., language, occupational therapy) relative to students served under ID. Student‐level socioeconomic status (free and reduced lunch) was more positively predictive of the number of special education services received than the neighborhood income of the school the student attended. Finally, the most significant racial disparities in service allocation were observed among students served under autism eligibility.

825,The ‘beautiful’ in information: thoughts about visual literacy and aesthetics,"Abstract Many agencies have promulgated standards for visual literacy. These groups include libraries, museums, computer science and graphic designers. The implementation of these standards tends to be skill-based courses for production. Other, larger questions about visual literacy are eclipsed and the growing number of research areas investigating visual literacy has made a complicated, contradictory literature. The dominant stream of discourse in the humanities emphasizes cultural, historical and social-constructionist perspectives. An alternative perspective, which was dominant until the 1970s, still seems to lead the sciences, a pseudo-objectivist perspective. The theme of this essay is that considering visual literacy from a yet-earlier analysis, that of Immanuel Kant’s Critique of judgment about ‘beauty,’ may lead to a shareable discourse to advance our study about the interpretation of visuals and create a foundation to allow for individual and community-based interpretations, a middle-way between an entirely strict empiricist view and a hyper-relative socially constructed one. This approach may be controversial, but all the more useful to sparking discussion of deeper issues about interpretation and professionals’ advancement in visual literacy.",,2016,95,7,1,False,,829,143873055,A.

828,Whispering Truth to Power: Everyday Resistance to Reconciliation in Postgenocide Rwanda,"For 100 days in 1994, genocide engulfed Rwanda. Since then, many in the international community have praised the country's postgenocide government for its efforts to foster national unity and reconciliation by downplaying ethnic differences and promoting ""one Rwanda for all Rwandans."" Examining how ordinary rural Rwandans experience and view these policies, ""Whispering Truth to Power"" challenges the conventional wisdom on postgenocide Rwanda. Susan Thomson finds that many of Rwanda's poorest citizens distrust the local officials charged with implementing the state program and believe that it ignores the deepest problems of the countryside: lack of land, jobs, and a voice in policies that affect lives and livelihoods. Based on interviews with dozens of Rwandan peasants and government officials, this book reveals how the nation's disenfranchised poor have been engaging in everyday resistance, cautiously and carefully ""whispering"" their truth to the powers that be. This quiet opposition, Thomson argues, suggests that some of the nation's most celebrated postgenocide policies have failed to garner the grassroots support needed to sustain peace. Reveals the lengths [to which] the current government has gone to restructure all spaces of Rwandan society, and how Rwandans continue to resist this state interference in their everyday lives.

This important publication will be of great value to scholars of Rwanda and genocide as well as students of reconciliation politics and transitional justice.

830,Making Americans: Children's Literature from 1930 to 1960,"American children need books that draw on their own history and circumstances, not just the classic European fairy tales. They need books that enlist them in the great democratic experiment that is the United States. These were the beliefs of many of the authors, illustrators, editors, librarians, and teachers who expanded and transformed children's book publishing between the 1930s and the 1960s. Although some later critics have argued that the books published in this era offered a vision of a safe, secure, simple world without injustice or unhappy endings, Gary D. Schmidt shows that the progressive political agenda shared by many Americans who wrote, illustrated, published, and taught children's books had a powerful effect. Authors like James Daugherty, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Lois Lenski, Ingri and Edgar Parin D'Aulaire, Virginia Lee Burton, Robert McCloskey, and many others addressed directly and indirectly the major social issues of a turbulent time: racism, immigration and assimilation, sexism, poverty, the Great Depression, World War II, the atomic bomb, and the threat of a global cold war. The central concern that many children's book authors and illustrators wrestled with was the meaning of America and democracy itself, especially the tension between individual freedoms and community ties. That process produced a flood of books focused on the American experience and intent on defining it in terms of progress toward inclusivity and social justice. Again and again, children's books addressed racial discrimination and segregation, gender roles, class differences, the fate of Native Americans, immigration and assimilation, war, and the role of the United States in the world. Fiction and nonfiction for children urged them to see these issues as theirs to understand, and in some ways, theirs to resolve. Making Americans is a study of a time when the authors and illustrators of children's books consciously set their eyes on national and international sights, with the hope of bringing the next generation into a sense of full citizenship.",,2013,0,13,1,False,,834,145601888,S.

831,When Sex Changed: Birth Control Politics and Literature between the World Wars,"In ""When Sex Changed,"" Layne Parish Craig analyzes the ways literary texts responded to the political, economic, sexual, and social values put forward by the birth control movements of the 1910s to the 1930s in the United States and Great Britain.Discussion of contraception and related topics (including feminism, religion, and eugenics) changed the way that writers depicted women, marriage, and family life. Tracing this shift, Craig compares disparate responses to the birth control controversy, from early skepticism by mainstream feminists, reflected in Charlotte Perkins Gilman s ""Herland,"" to concern about the movement s race and class implications suggested in Nella Larsen s ""Quicksand,"" to enthusiastic speculation about contraception s political implications, as in Virginia Woolf s ""Three Guineas.""While these texts emphasized birth control s potential to transform marriage and family life and emancipate women from the slavery of constant childbearing, birth control advocates also used less-than-liberatory language that excluded the poor, the mentally ill, non-whites, and others. Ultimately, Craig argues, the debates that began in these early political and literary texts texts that document both the birth control movement s idealism and its exclusionary rhetoric helped shape the complex legacy of family planning and women s rights with which the United States and the United Kingdom still struggle.""",,2013,41,7,0,False,,835,2110108433,Jane Martin,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

The first part discusses the post‐war educational context through analysing contradictions in curriculum policies and expectations for girls’ education and exploring the relevance of these to the resurgence of feminism as a mass social movement amongst ‘educated’ women of the time. The second part presents two case studies of the school experiences of two New Zealand women who have, as adults, become educators and come to identify themselves as feminists. The focus of the case studies is on the strategies those women developed to deal with the contradictions in their lives and to trace the beginnings of their political radicalisation.",,1987,32,21,0,False,,838,113217470,C.

She traces this exclusion from a misunderstanding of the writings of Plato, Rousseau, and Pestalozzi on the education of women, and builds a comprehensive critique of the concepts of education, liberal education, and teaching which are accepted by analytic philosophers of education. Martin proposes a possible reconstruction of the field of philosophy of education to include women, and describes the benefits of such a needed undertaking.",,1982,0,77,4,False,,839,49816131,B.

Two bodies of research in the British sociology of education — the cultural tradition and the political economy tradition — are discussed in terms of the ways in which they address the question of gender. The radical theories of social and cultural reproduction of class structure are then considered. It is argued that it is necessary to include a consideration of gender reproduction in any theory of class reproduction, whether the perspective is from a social or a cultural model. A theory of the production of gender differences inside and outside the schools is contrasted with prevailing reproduction theories. The paper concludes with a call for further research in the field of women's education that will both recognize the existence of class and male hegemony in the schools and will at the same time acknowledge that the constant need to reimpose hegemony entails both struggle and the possibility for change.",,1982,6,98,6,False,,840,1410613169,B.

She calls for a reexamination of the Whiteness embedded in these colorblind theories, which have been universally framed and have thus sidestepped the issues of racial imbalance implicit in colorblindness. She adds to the critique of these theories by showing how differently some of the themes that have proved generative for theories of care might have been interpreted if a Black feminist perspective rather than a liberal White feminist perspective had been assumed. Following her critique of four key themes—the moral relevance of the situation, the primacy of survival, the significance of the standpoint from which values are understood, and the moral power of narrative—Th...",,1998,0,267,40,False,,841,13945230,Clark A.

838,Transformando fronteras: Chicana feminist transformative pedagogies,"In this paper, C. Alejandra Elenes proposes ways to implement the goals of border/transformative pedagogies in classroom practices in order to deal with the multiplicity of ideologies present in educational settings. The theorization and discussion presented is based on the sometimes tense relationships between Chicana faculty and White women students. Border/transformative pedagogy incorporates as social practices the construction of knowledge(s) capable of analyzing conflicts over meaning. This pedagogy is concerned with the elimination of racial, gender, class, and sexual orientation hierarchies by decentralizing hegemonic practices that places at the center of cultural practices a homogeneous belief in US society that has marginalized the cultural practices of people of color, women, and gays and lesbians. Thus, it can be viewed as liberatory by students who agree with those goals, and oppressive for students with more conservative leanings. Based on Gloria Anzaldua's conceptualization of mestiza consciousness, border/transformative pedagogies propose ways in which we can enact a practice where students and teachers participate, and that tries to undo dualistic thinking. Thus, this paper, which is based on classroom observations and analysis of student evaluations, is self-reflexive. Particular emphasis is placed on finding ways to be able to bring multiple ideologies and points of view to classroom discussion in ways that productive discourse is enabled. The discussion also centers on the contradictions present in classrooms that seek to be liberatory to the goals of democracy. Finally, the paper discusses ways in which women of color faculty can deal with racism existing in many contemporary educational settings.",,2001,42,64,5,False,,842,115317183,Louis McFarland,,,,,,,,,,,Geography,

The inherently personal ways that individuals classify sexual identity, experience and expression make the subject prone to lengthy bouts of contextualisation and clarification that can leave a reader lost and undermine a work's effectiveness. Although Susana Pena's extensive background in Cuban-American sexuality and expression grants her a strong pedigree to tackle the challenge, the basic structure of iOye Loca!: From the Mariel Boatlift to Gay Cuban Miami ultimately undermines an otherwise intriguing work.The book analyses the evolution of homosexual identity and expression among Miami-based Cuban Americans following the 1980 Mariel boatlift. In particular, the author focuses on the cultural impact of gender transgressive gay Cubans, whom Pena classifies as locas, who were transferred en masse to the US as part of the boatlift. The author suggests that locas adopted and flaunted a particularly visible effeminacy as a kind of quiet resistance to the state-sponsored homosexual persecution of the revolution. When in 1980, this exact kind of gender transgressive homosexuality began being targeted for removal from Cuba, gay men suddenly found themselves indirectly encouraged to adopt or exaggerate a loca identity.The book then transitions to the US, where Pena discusses the way locas grouped together in the migrant camps that were established while the US decided what to do with the increasingly stigmatised flood of Mariel Cubans. This grouping resulted in increasing visibility of locas in the intense media coverage surrounding Mariel, further stigmatising these refugees. Consequently, the existing Cuban-American community, which had previously enjoyed a largely positive reputation within the US, sought to distance itself from these 'Marielitos'.Pena does an excellent job of setting the stage for readers to delve into the book's ultimate goal of illustrating the complicated cultural impact of locas on Cuban-American gay culture. However, the reality of source limitations hinders the book.As a social analyst, I was very appreciative of ... evidence that I could hold in my hand (and photocopy, code and manipulate in other sociological ways). However, not all rastros [traces] of Cuban American gay culture were this material in their form. From my incipient interest in gay Mariel, I knew I would have to develop ways to investigate what was made invisible, what undeniably existed but was evidenced only by a fleeting visibility. (p. xxix)The result is that the author goes looking for echoes of loca culture's impact in the shaping of the post-1980 Cuban-American homosexual community. …",,2015,0,13,1,False,,849,36382271,Penelope E.

Further Reflections on the Limits of Prejudice Reduction as a Model of Social Change","This paper aims to encourage greater reflexivity about the limits of prejudice reduction as a model of social change, particularly when applied to societies characterised by historically entrenched patterns of inequality. We begin by outlining some underlying values and assumptions of this model. We then elaborate how our research on political attitudes in post-apartheid South Africa has led us to question, qualify and sometimes reject those assumptions and move towards a ‘contextualist’ perspective on the efficacy of different models of social change. We agree that the project of getting us to like one another may be crucial for producing change in some contexts. In other contexts, however, it is an epiphenomenon that distracts psychologists from the main causes of, and solutions to, problems such as race, class, or gender discrimination. In still others, with an irony that is evidenced increasingly by research, prejudice reduction may actually contribute to the very problem it is designed to resolve. That is, it may diminish the extent to which social injustice is acknowledged, rejected and challenged.",,2013,64,32,2,True,,852,67150396,L. Isherwood,6739604,K. McPhillips,,,,,,,,,Philosophy,

853,Queer Company: The Role and Meaning of Friendship in Gay Men’s Work Lives,"Drawn from in-depth qualitative research, Queer Company provides the first extended, academic analysis of gay men's workplace friendships, offering theoretical and empirical insights into a subject that is timely and important. Although theoretically framed in poststructuralism and the sociology of friendship, this book also draws on feminism, organisation studies, gender and sexuality studies to explore the diverse roles and meanings of gay men's workplace friendships. Shedding light on the significance of workplace friendship for those who participate in them, particularly in terms of how these workplace relationships can help gay men to construct meaningful identities and selves, Queer Company examines the manner in which gay men's workplace friendships are established, developed and organised, whilst considering the effects of organisational contexts upon friendship processes. A detailed investigation of the links between friendship, sexuality, gender and intimacy in the workplace, this book will appeal to scholars of management studies as well as sociologists with interests in gender and sexuality, the sociology of organisations and cultural studies.",Psychology of Sexualities Review,2011,0,27,1,False,,857,143958377,M.

856,"Parergonality, paratranslation, and text-as-house imagery: six Romanian-language editions of Oscar Wilde’s fairy-tales","This paper focuses on the mediating role paratexts perform in the transmission of a text from one culture to another. Our case in point is a series of (re)translations of Oscar Wilde’s fairy tales into Romanian (published between 1911 and 2018), with their respective allographic paratextuality (prefaces, postfaces, translator’s foreword, introduction, glossaries, author biographies, dedications etc.). The paratexts are examined with a view to distinguishing between those which allocate authority to the translated text and those which undermine it. Architectural metaphorics will be resorted to, for a better illustration of the relation between text and paratext. If, according to Kant (1987[1781]), pareregon is to ergon what columns are to buildings, and if, when it comes to books, parergon is a (near-)synonym for paratext, the text-as-house imagery proposed here is meant to encapsulate the way books assemble their (para)textual contents for the reading public.",Swedish Journal of Romanian Studies,2022,0,0,0,True,,860,73250693,M.

865,"When Inequality Fails: Power, Group Dominance, and Societal Change","Social dominance theory was developed to account for why societies producing surplus take and maintain the form of group-based dominance hierarchies, in which at least one socially-constructed group has more power than another, and in which men are more powerful than women and adults more powerful than children. Although the theory has always allowed for societies to differ in their severity of group-based dominance and how it is implemented, it has predicted that alternative forms of societal organization will occur rarely and not last. This paper revisits aspects of the theory that allow for the possibility of societal alternatives and change. We also consider boundary conditions for the theory, and whether its current theoretical apparatus can account for societal change. By expanding the typical three-level dynamic system to describe societies (micro-meso-macro) into four levels (including meta) to consider how societies relate to one another, we identify political tensions that are unstable power structures rather than stable hierarchies. In research on institutions, we identify smaller-scale alternative forms of social organization. We identify logical, empirical, and theoretical shortcomings in social dominance theory’s account of stability and change, consider alternative forms of social organization, and suggest fruitful avenues for theoretical extension.",,2013,129,48,3,True,,869,67042523,G.

This study examined whether an association exists between a lesbian's sex role identity, particularly the dimension of femininity, and her abusive behavior. The hypothesis that jealousy in the relationship would be positively associated with reported incidences of abusive behavior was also examined. The results show that when abuse is broadly defined a sizable minority report high incidences of overall abuse and psychological abuse at some time during their current relationship. The most salient finding of this study was the strong evidence of a relationship between jealousy and abusive behavior. The implications of these findings underscore the need for continued and enhanced delivery of services. Other implications of this study point toward consciousness-raising to the larger community about institutionalized and individual homophobia and heterosexism.",,2004,40,23,5,False,,873,33104908,Kim A.

I explored how privileged college students were led to understand how individuals get opportunities in life and ultimately achieve success. Also, I explored what moments or elements caused participants to question what they had learned and what barriers they faced to engaging in work for justice. All findings contributed to understanding what led privileged college students to engage in work for a more just environment. Using the social construction of dominant group privilege and ally development theory as the theoretical frameworks to guide this study, I analyzed how participants came to see injustice within the context of their privileged identity and why, unlike many of their peers, they chose to work on changing a social system from which they benefitted. In all, nine students holding privileged identities participated in three qualitative life history interviews each through which data for the study were collected. Profiles of each participant were developed from the data. The data were then transcribed, coded, analyzed, and organized into emerging themes. The findings revealed that a search for authenticity, environmental influences, a critical event, or experience as other first made privileged students aware of injustice. Barriers to participant engagement reported most often included not understanding their role, a general lack of awareness about injustice, others influential in their lives lacking awareness, and the absence of skills interacting with people who held diverse identities and in doing effective work on justice issues. Finally, educational institutions had significant influence on participant awareness of injustice issues, the need to advocate for change, and ultimately their decisions to take action.

880,A Novel Theory-Based Virtual Reality Training to Improve Patient Safety Culture in the Department of Surgery of a Large Academic Medical Center: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study,"Background Preventable surgical errors of varying degrees of physical, emotional, and financial harm account for a significant number of adverse events. These errors are frequently tied to systemic problems within a health care system, including the absence of necessary policies/procedures, obstructive cultural hierarchy, and communication breakdown between staff. We developed an innovative, theory-based virtual reality (VR) training to promote understanding and sensemaking toward the holistic view of the culture of patient safety and high reliability. Objective We aim to assess the effect of VR training on health care workers’ (HCWs’) understanding of contributing factors to patient safety events, sensemaking of patient safety culture, and high reliability organization principles in the laboratory environment. Further, we aim to assess the effect of VR training on patient safety culture, TeamSTEPPS behavior scores, and reporting of patient safety events in the surgery department of an academic medical center in the clinical environment. Methods This mixed methods study uses a pre-VR versus post-VR training study design involving attending faculty, residents, nurses, technicians of the department of surgery, and frontline HCWs in the operation rooms at an academic medical center. HCWs’ understanding of contributing factors to patient safety events will be assessed using a scale based on the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System. We will use the data frame theory framework, supported by a semistructured interview guide to capture the sensemaking process of patient safety culture and principles of high reliability organizations. Changes in the culture of patient safety will be quantified using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality surveys on patient safety culture. TeamSTEPPS behavior scores based on observation will be measured using the Teamwork Evaluation of Non-Technical Skills tool. Patient safety events reported in the voluntary institutional reporting system will be compared before the training versus those after the training. We will compare the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality patient safety culture scores and patient safety events reporting before the training versus those after the training by using descriptive statistics and a within-subject 2-tailed, 2-sample t test with the significance level set at .05. Results Ethics approval was obtained in May 2021 from the institutional review board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (22-1150). The enrollment of participants for this study will start in fall 2022 and is expected to be completed by early spring 2023. The data analysis is expected to be completed by July 2023. Conclusions Our findings will help assess the effectiveness of VR training in improving HCWs’ understanding of contributing factors of patient safety events, sensemaking of patient safety culture, and principles and behaviors of high reliability organizations.

883,Arab American Women’s Ethnic Identity and Religiosity: Their Relationship to Perceived Discrimination and Psychological Wellbeing,"Following the recent events around the world, there has been a heightened sense of hostility towards the Muslim community. Now, more than ever it seems, there has been tension caused by unfortunate acts of racial, ethnic, and religious intolerance. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relation of perceived ethnic and religious discrimination to well-being. It was hypothesized that individuals who have been discriminated against will have a lower level of psychological well-being, those with higher ethnic identity will have higher level of psychological well-being, and those with higher religiosity will have higher level of psychological well-being. Results showed that while there were no significant correlations found for any of the relationships in the hypothesis, there were significant correlations for other variables in this study. ARAB AMERICAN ETHNIC IDENTITY 3 Arab American Women’s Ethnic Identity and Religiosity: Their Relationship to Perceived Discrimination and Psychological Wellbeing According to the Arab American Institute (AAI), there are about 3.7 millions Americans who have ties to an Arab country. There are 22 countries that are considered part of the Arab world, which includes countries in the Middle East and North Africa, such as Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and Algeria (Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, 2009). While Arab Americans live in all 50 states, the majority of them (more than two thirds) can be found in just ten of the states. These states include New York, Florida, Texas, California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Michigan (Arab American Institute, n.d.). According to the ADC, the Detroit-Dearborn area contains the largest communities of Arab Americans (Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, 2009). Although the majority of Arabs throughout the world are Muslim, they can be Christian or Jewish as well. A Muslim is an individual who observes the religion of Islam, which the ADC defines “as an Arabic word meaning submission to God” (Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, 2009). Muslims believe in one God whose main messenger was Muhammad, and they live following the teachings of God, or Allah (Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, 2009). While most Arab Americans are Christian, the Muslim population is the quickest increasing in the Arab American community (Arab American Institute, n.d). As the Arab American and Muslim populations have increased in the United States, so have various forms of prejudice and discrimination against them, from extreme instances of hate crimes to more subtle, possibly inadvertent, negative behaviors. Hate crimes are crimes aimed at an individual because of his or her race, religion, ethnicity, or other aspects of the victim’s group membership (Cheng, Ickes, & Kenworthy, 2013). Although all forms of hate crimes in the U.S. ARAB AMERICAN ETHNIC IDENTITY 4 increased 5.04% during 2015 (Levin, n.d.), hate crimes against the Muslim population in 2015 were the highest they have been since the events on 9/11, with a reported 78% increase (Levin, n.d.). Data on anti-Arab hate crimes are relatively limited, as the FBI has just recently added this category as a new hate crime, but reports show that these have increased 219% (Levin, n.d.). Even though anti-Arab attacks are separate from those crimes classified as anti-Muslim, the two often correlate with one another. Because of this, anti-Muslim hate crimes can be sometimes wrongly categorized as anti-Arab hate crimes (and vice versa); therefore, the number of incidents in each category may be even higher (Levin, n.d.). The hate crimes themselves can range from extreme cases of murder and arson to property damage and verbal abuse, all of which seem to be spurred by the poor depictions and negative stereotypes surrounding the Muslim population (Perry, 2014). Outlets such as national media stimulate prejudicial beliefs and discriminatory actions through their negative depictions of Muslims (Cheng, Ickes, & Kenworthy, 2013). In the West, there appears to be a culture that allows for not only anti-Muslim feelings, but also anti-Arab and anti-Middle East as well. Muslims and Arabs have been the subject to a long past of discrimination, whether it be violent, or non-violent (Perry, 2014). Other forms of discrimination outside of hate crimes include discrimination in the workplace, Arab American or Muslim individuals being illegally removed from airplanes, and FBI misconduct in the form of racial profiling, stereotyping, and other instances of illegal detainment (Awad, 2010). Another type of discrimination aimed at individuals from minority groups is called microaggressions, which are defined as indirect forms of bias that are commonly inadvertent and even exhibited unnoticed by the individual committing them (Nadal et al., 2012). Prior research has shown that microaggressions are generally found to be common in the lives of individuals of ARAB AMERICAN ETHNIC IDENTITY 5 color, sexual minorities, and women (Nadal et al., 2012). For ethnic minority groups, encountering microaggressions seems to highlight their lower social status level, even if the microaggressions are committed relatively innocently by the perpetrator. For example, African Americans who have experienced such offenses have reported them to not only be common, everyday occurrences, but also extreme environmental stressors because they negatively impact their self-perception and behaviors (Huynh, 2012). Latinos and Asian Americans undergo similar thoughts as members of these ethnic minority groups also feel as though they are indeed different from others or are truly not American (Huynh, 2012). Even though prior research has reported on microaggressions common in the lives of ethnic and other minority group, there is very little research on this form of discrimination against religious minority groups (Nadal et al., 2012). A study performed by Nadal et al. (2012) sought to fill this gap in the literature by studying such incidents aimed towards Muslim Americans. The researchers coded responses of ten Muslim American participants and found that six broad categories of religious microaggressions emerged. The themes ranged from blatantly discriminatory to subtle, which demonstrates the variety of ways Muslim Americans can feel threatened or discriminated against. Example themes include: 1) Endorsing Religious Stereotypes of Muslims as Terrorists, which occurs when others express that all Muslims are associated with terrorists groups and are horrible people; and 2) Islamophobic and Mocking Language, in which others ridicule and use unkind language toward the Muslim individual (Nadal et al., 2012). Further, Nadal et al. (2012) report that prior studies have shown that it might not, however, be clear to Muslim Americans who encounter microaggressions why they face microaggressions; these individuals may question whether it is because of their race/ethnicity ARAB AMERICAN ETHNIC IDENTITY 6 rather than their religion. The participants also revealed how experiencing microaggressions caused them to experience negative emotions and distress. Ethnic Identity's Relation to Well-Being Studies have shown that the higher the level of individuals' ethnic identity, defined as the feeling of ethnic belonging, inclusion, and commitment concerning cultural customs and principles, the stronger their sense of psychological well-being (Sheldon, Oliver, & Balaghi, 2015). As part of his or her ethnic identity, an individual can be considered bicultural or multicultural if they identify with more than one culture (Benet-Martinez & Haritatos, 2005). There exists, however, a complicated balance between the different cultures a person belongs to and there are positive and negative aspects for the individual. It becomes imperative then as to how a particular individual copes with the frequently contrasting cultural systems he or she is exposed to and the overall identity formation can different from person to person (BenetMartinez & Haritatos, 2005). While being bicultural, for example, is associated with a sense of pride, community, and individuality, there is also the sense of identity confusion and collision of the sets of values from both cultures, in addition to the racial stereotypes and pressures to adhere to one culture over the other that can arise (Benet-Martinez & Haritatos, 2005). Research has also shown that this result holds true for minority groups that are subject to psychological stress. For Arab Americans, a minority group that faces stressors resulting from prejudice, discrimination, and other forms of adversity, ethnic identity could play a mediating role between psychological stress and well-being (Sheldon et al., 2015). Sheldon et al. (2015) examined ethnic identity's relation to well-being in Arab American emerging adults. It was predicted that there would be a positive relation between ethnic identity and well-being. Results indicated that this was the case, as there were positive relations between aspects of the Arab ARAB AMERICAN ETHNIC IDENTITY 7 American individual’s ethnic identity and well-being. Religiosity's Relation to Well-Being In addition to ethnic identity, the level of religiosity can also play a role in an individual’s psychological well-being. There is a possible relationship between the level of religiosity and the level of psychological well-being (Gulamhussein & Eaton, 2015). It has been shown that there is a positive relationship between religiosity and subjective well-being, which is defined as the cognitive and affective assessments of an individual’s life or, simply stated, happiness and satisfaction (Abdel-Khalek, 2011). In addition, research has found that religious beliefs and practices are related to lower levels of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Religiosity is also related to higher well-being, optimism, having significant meaning in life, and many more positive outcomes (Abde",,2017,13,1,0,False,,889,92272474,P. Gurin,11997449,B. A.

Jane F. Gerhard examines the piece's popularity to understand how ideas about feminism migrated from activist and intellectual circles into the American mainstream in the last three decades of the twentieth century. More than most social movements, feminism was transmitted and understood through culture--art installations, Ms. Magazine, All in the Family, and thousands of other cultural artefacts. But the phenomenon of cultural feminism came under extraordinary criticism in the late 1970s and 1980s Gerhard analyses these divisions over whether cultural feminism was sufficiently activist in light of the shifting line separating liberalism from radicalism in post-1970s America. She concludes with a chapter on the 1990s, when The Dinner Party emerged as a target in political struggles over public funding for the arts, even as academic feminists denounced the piece for its alleged essentialism. The path that The Dinner Party travelled--from inception (1973) to completion (1979) to tour (1979-1989) to the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Museum (2007)--sheds light on the history of American feminism since 1970 and on the ways popular feminism in particular can illuminate important trends and transformations in the broader culture.",,2013,0,14,0,False,,898,2132479260,When Lev,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article we focus on one of these methods: model-based recursive partitioning. This algorithmic approach is reviewed and illustrated by means of instructive examples and an application to the Mincer equation. For readers unfamiliar with algorithmic methods, the explanation starts with the introduction of the predecessor method classification and regression trees. 
With respect to the application and interpretation of model-based recursive partitioning, we address the principle of parsimony and illustrate that the model-based recursive partitioning approach can be employed to test whether a postulated model is in accordance with Ockham's Razor or whether relevant covariates have been omitted. Finally, an overview of available statistical software is provided to facilitate the applicability in social science

904,"Over-sexed and under surveillance: Adolescent sexualities, cultural anxieties, and thick desire","In this chapter, we extend our earlier work on sexuality education in U.S. public schools in which we forwarded a theory of adolescent sexuality, which we called thick desire (Fine & McClelland, 2006). We chose the metaphor of thickness in order to evoke the multi-faceted ‘nature’ of sexual desire and to underline our reading of desire as a product of intimate and social negotiations. In contrast to contemporary theories that frame sexual desire as emerging solely from individual motivation, behaviour, or fantasy (within the person or the couple; see Basson 2000, 2001; Brotto, Bitzer, Laan, Leiblum, & Luria, 2010; Carvalho & Nobre, 2010; cf., Kaschak & Tiefer, 2001), thick desire invites a theoretical and methodological intervention. It reminds us that bodies adhere with connective tissue to economic, political, historic, and psychological landscapes—meaning that desire never stands on its own. It is a concept we placed into feminist discourse to signal how bodies are linked to social arrangements, politics, yearnings, deprivations, and betrayals in public settings and that these connections— both supportive and restrictive—inform how young people learn to develop a sense of desire. Thick desire encourages researchers and policy makers alike to situate desire as an ‘entry point’ (McClelland & Frost, 2014), a window through which we might begin to notice the extensive web of factors in a person’s life, family, community, and nation when making evaluations and recommendations about how individuals can and should learn about, practice, and engage with sexuality. Since 2006, we developed the concept of thick desire in a series of publications, pushing at its edges to help clarify how we understand the dynamics between desire and cultural anxieties that have mapped onto adolescent bodies, as enacted in policy and research. We have developed thick desire with several dimensions in mind, including: the legal sexual surveillance of adolescents (Fine & McClelland, 2007), the role of feminist research methods (McClelland & Fine, 2008a, 2008b), and the implicit characteristics of federally-funded evaluation research in the US (McClelland & Fine, 2008c).

As a result, how we negotiate the challenges of inequality in the twenty-first century may depend less on what people consciously think about ""difference"" and more on what we inadvertently assume. Through an analysis of commonsense knowledge, Pascale expertly provides new insights into familiar topics. In addition, by analyzing local practices in the context of established cultural discourses, Pascale shows how the weight of history bears on the present moment, both enabling and constraining possibilities. Pascale tests the boundaries of sociological knowledge and offers new avenues for conceptualizing social change.

Due to the female defendant's incongruence with offender stereotypes, mock jurors may direct greater attention to encoding features of the defendant at the expense of carefully considering the evidence. Study 1 (N = 101) found that mock jurors took into account the strength of the evidence against male (stereotypical), but not female (counterstereotypical) defendants. Consistent with this, Study 2 (N = 144) demonstrated that mock jurors were less able to recall facts of the case, but better able to recall details of the defendant, when the defendant was female rather than male. The third and final study (N = 113) found that participants spent longer looking at a female defendant than they did looking at a male defendant in a video simulation of a mock trial.

912,"Race, Network Hiring, and Statistical Discrimination","Purpose – Research has shown that employers often disfavor racial minorities − particularly African Americans − even when whites and minorities present comparable resumes when applying for jobs. Extant studies have been hard pressed to distinguish between taste-based discrimination where employers' racial animus is the key motivation for their poor treatment of minorities and variants of statistical discrimination where there is no assumption at all of racial animus on the part of the employer. This chapter proposes a test of these theories by observing whether employers use employee referrals as a “cheap” source of information to help assess applicant quality.Methodology/approach – Unique quantitative data encompassing the entire pool of 987 candidates interviewed by one company in the western United States during a 13-month period are used to test our arguments.Findings – We find that employers in this setting are making use of the cheap information available to them: Consistent with statistical discrimination theory, minority referrals are more likely to receive a job offer than non-referred minority applicants, and are not disfavored relative to referred whites.Originality/value of the chapter – Both statistical and taste-based theories of discrimination propose similar observable outcomes (lower rates of disfavored minority hiring). While different mental processes are being invoked by taste-based and statistical discrimination theories, the theories are extremely difficult to distinguish in terms of observable behaviors. Especially for the purpose of designing legal remedies and labor market policies to ameliorate the disparate treatment of minority groups, differentiating between these theories is a high priority.",,2014,69,42,1,False,,920,39996296,R.

913,A Game for Rough Girls? A History of Women’s Football in Britain,"A Game for Rough Girls? analyzes historical and contemporary aspects of womenʼs participation in football and advocates transformational changes. Connecting themes throughout the book are the contemptuous attitude toward female players that has long prevailed, the persistent idea of gender division on which this attitude is based, the construction of football to protect male dominance, and womenʼs own failure to contest systematically their marginalization. The book is divided into two parts and five chapters that are bracketed by an introduction and conclusion. Part I examines womenʼs football from the 1880s at the local, regional, and national level, within the context of the development of the game of football, womenʼs sport, and social change. Williams traces the evolution of the womenʼs game from a largely voluntary, autonomous, and spectator-supported enterprise into one that is more widely participatory and bureaucratically and externally (meaning male) controlled. She goes on to examine the construction of private and public memory in womenʼs football, as well as the structural, organizational, attitudinal, and media constraints that have shaped and devalued womenʼs involvement and produced a striking lack of awareness of, or interest in, the early history of the womenʼs game. In Part II Williams focuses on the rise of womenʼs football in a global and professional era, and she explores relevant political, economic, regional, cultural, racial, and sexual developments inside and outside both football and England. She discusses the direct and indirect effects of equal opportunities legislation and footballʼs growth into a huge international business, comparing developments affecting women in countries such as Norway, Namibia, and the United States, as well as in major international sports competitions such as the Olympic Games and the Womenʼs World Cup. Among the bookʼs strengths is its raising of fundamental questions about how gender and sexual-role stereotypes and divisions in football have been constructed and perpetuated, how they relate to and reinforce broader patterns and practices, how they affect the development of womenʼs football at all levels, particularly the most competitive, and how they urgently need changing in order for the womenʼs game to advance. Williams is deliberately provocative in challenging long-standing traditions and perceived wisdom in order to shake up the football establishment and to inspire people to think about and then alter restrictive attitudes and practices. She strongly advocates specific changes that she regards as essential to the achievement of womenʼs basic human rights in football and in sport more broadly.

915,The Culture of Narcissism: A Philosophical Analysis of “Fitspiration” and the Objectified Self,"Abstract This article is a philosophical examination of the social media culture of fitness and the behavior which most distinctly characterizes it. Of the numerous and varied digital subcultures emerging with the rise of photo-based social media during the 2010s, the culture surrounding fitness, or “fitspiration,” stands out as one of the more notable. Research has identified the phenomenon as consisting to a large extent of users engaging in behaviors of self-sexualization and self-objectification, following, not unexpectedly, the inherent focus within fitness on the body, its maintenance and ultimately its appearance. Research also demonstrates that, for many, viewing and engaging in this behavior is linked to a deterioration of body-image, general self-perception and mental well-being. In this article, I analyze the phenomenon within a philosophical framework in which I combine the philosophical theory of Jean Baudrillard on media and the consumption of signs and the psychoanalytic perspective of Jacques Lacan on subjectivity, narcissism and desire. Using this framework, I discuss the body assuming the properties of a commodified object deriving its cultural value and meaning from the signs which adorn it, resulting in the “fitspiration” user imperative becoming the identification with an artificial object alien to the self, necessitating a narcissistically oriented, yet pernicious self-objectification. I argue that “fitspiration,” as well as the photo-based social media which both enables and defines it, indulges narcissism, detrimentally exaggerating the narcissistic inclinations lying at the center of subjectivity.",Physical Culture and Sport: Studies and Research,2022,27,1,0,True,,923,104201172,Emily Bonistall,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
916,"Holding Your Square: Masculinities, Streetlife, and Violence","socialization contexts have the best chance of promoting successful youth development. Like all works, the book has its weaknesses, but in this case these might be better called “frustrations.” In my view, the two research sites are a blessing and a curse. Using more than one site offers greater confidence in our ability to make generalizations and simultaneously can help pinpoint unique aspects of social context in developmental processes. Indeed, while many of the main findings presented here are consistent across sites, there are some distinct differences between Denver and Chicago. But are the different findings due to the contextual differences in the two cities? The result of varying measures of key variables in each site? Or, as most likely, the result of different sampling methodologies used in each city? (In Denver, a representative sampling of neighborhoods was utilized and in Chicago, the sample was restricted to predominantly African-American neighborhoods with relatively high and low poverty.) The answer is crucial, but is not clear here. A more coherent message would also be beneficial. In several instances it appears that there are so many contingencies operating that it is hard to make sense of anything. As but one example, the authors write, “A good family has a positive effect on youth development that is essentially the same in a good or bad neighborhood and, depending upon the success outcome, accounts for 9–56 percent of the variance in our full models” (p. 284). Criminologists may be surprised to learn that “neighborhood Disadvantage/Poverty and criminal behavior are not related in Denver and only weakly related in Chicago” (p. 291). The authors argue that their reliance on self-report data rather than official arrest rates accounts for this finding. This result though is contrary to a wide of body of research and more attention is warranted, especially given the fact that rates of self-reported delinquency were substantially higher in Denver compared with Chicago (p. 83). At the very least, one needs to assess whether this finding holds for serious crimes across various subgroups in the population. Furthermore, I would like to see more attention placed on ethnicity and immigration, concentrated affluence, and agency and choice. I was surprised to read that “Much of the unexplained variance, particularly at the individual level of analysis should properly be attributed to personal choice” (p. 275). This begs for further discussion. But perhaps most of all, I would like to have heard more of the narratives from the kids themselves who were successful in bad neighborhoods. Why did they think were successful, despite the perceived odds? One of the goals of research is to debunk myths and challenge conventional wisdom. An important takeaway message from this study is that many youth growing up in poor, disadvantaged neighborhoods are successfully completing the demanding tasks of adolescence. Poverty and disadvantage do not inevitably lead to a life of crime and pathology. As Elliott and his colleagues conclude, they have learned much and there is much still to be learned. I look forward to learning more from this impressive group of scholars and I recommend this book to anyone who is committed to understanding whether, how, and why neighborhoods matter.",,2007,1,92,13,False,,924,145425469,Michelle V.

918,The Single Woman: A Discursive Investigation,"The increase in numbers of single people has been described as one of the greatest social phenomena of western society. Most women will spend periods of their lives alone, without a committed partner relationship. Yet there is still a degree of social stigma attached to this status. Single women are a crucial group for study in relation to perceived changes in family life and relationships. This book provides a new understanding of what is often taken-for-granted – female single identity. 
 
 
In an examination of extracts from her interviews with women aged 30 to 60 years and living alone, Jill Reynolds explores how women deal with this potentially stigmatized identity. She focuses on identity and self-representation through consideration of discourse and the conversational moves made by the participants. Her analysis highlights that the culturally available and familiar resources for understanding singleness are highly polarized. Single women weave their way through the extreme contrasts of a denigrated or an empowered identity. Thus, while most participants give very positive accounts, they also pay attention to widespread social expectations that success in life involves a long-term committed relationship. 
 
 
This book makes an important contribution to the understanding of the lives of single women and represents a challenge to the considerable literature on gender and family life which has inadequately theorized singleness. It will be of great interest to academics and students in social psychology, sociology, social work and social policy. It will also be of particular interest to students of gender studies, qualitative research, narrative studies, conversation analysis and discourse analysis.",,2008,0,61,6,False,,926,1735121,N.

935,[Successful aging: perception of aged immigrant women from Black Africa in Montreal].,"OBJECTIVES
This article focuses on older immigrant women from Black Africa living in Montreal. Its purpose is to present the meaning that they give to ""successful aging"" in their hosting country and to highlight the factors they consider essential to experience ""a maximum of satisfaction and happiness"" during this stage of their life. It is based on the fact that Quebec society is facing an ever increasing aging of its population which is accompanied with a more and more significant ethnocultural diversification due to immigration. Statistically the number of black women over 65 years increases over the years. In Canada, older women in general are victims of various social inequalities. These vulnerabilities are even more flagrant when one comes from a visible ethnocultural community and can have a biopsychosocial impact on the lives of these older women. These situations justify our concern for the quality of life and well-being of these aged women.


METHOD
Our methodology leans on an exploratory qualitative approach conducted with seven women aged from 65 to 77 years who immigrated to Canada when they were more than 50 years old. Five of them had less than 10 years of stay in Quebec while the other two were 18 and 20 years. To gather their views, semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded. The content was analyzed with an approach inspired by analysis techniques of data from the grounded theory. Then, an intersectional analytical framework has been favored, firstly to understand the complex nature of various forms of identities and social inequalities experienced by the participants, and secondly to examine the connections between discriminatory phenomena such as ageism, racism or sexism, ethnicity and even the migratory journey.


RESULTS
As results, this research allows noting that older immigrant women of Black Africa are facing many difficulties due to the interrelation of their age, their ethnic background, their gender, with other aspects of their identity such as culture, language, and migratory course. Anyway, it is important to emphasize that the majority looked at aging and this time of their life as normal and even as a privilege. Their comments reflected no denial, no bitterness, and no regret. These women who presented themselves as resourceful people, hardworking, determined and combative have enumerated four key elements that they find essential for successful aging: social engagement, intergenerational relationships, financial autonomy and faith. Even though a multitude of obstacles affects their perception of ""successful ageing,"" their stories have demonstrated their ability to cope with difficulties and have shown their inner strengths. Black African older women are working hard to integrate or adjust to an environment in which changes and novelty are not always favorable to their development.


CONCLUSION
If old age is undoubtedly a woman's world, it is also more and more diverse and multi-ethnic. In an ever-changing immigration environment, the results of this study cannot be generalized because of the limited number of participants. However, this research clearly shows that significant efforts are still required to tackle the problems and obstacles faced by older and aging ethnic minorities. Beside limitations identified in this study, several avenues of research could be considered, particularly with regard to their relationship to health services, in conjunction with language and cultural barriers. It is therefore appropriate to interpellate government officials to take into account in their new social policies: gender, ethnicity, economic conditions, social isolation, and poor access to health services of aged immigrant women.",Santé mentale au Québec,2013,18,0,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Older immigrant women from Black Africa living in Montreal are facing many difficulties due to the interrelation of their age, their ethnic background, their gender, with other aspects of their identity such as culture, language, and migratory course.'}",943,2053033253,Stephen M.

936,Moral Choices: Towards a conceptual Model of Black Male Moral Development (BMMD),"Black males are frequently presented in the media as amoral beings. Negative depictions of Black males in television, radio, print, and the internet portray them as gangsters, rapists, womanizers, drug dealers and thugs. These depictions are rarely balanced with moral portrayals of Black males as successful contributors to society, family-oriented, working professionals, positive role models, or leaders. Negative representations of these males serve to shape societal perceptions of Black boys, youth, and adults (Hall, 2001; Hutchinson, 1997; Jackson, 2006). At a minimum, these perceptions demarcate Black males from being 'good' or 'righteous' individuals, rendering them as morally ambiguous beings. More often, they are presented as the vision of evil, embodying the loss of American morality. These perceptions of Black males underscore the importance of understanding their identities and development as moral individuals. However, understanding identity among Black males is a complex task, given the nexus of moral, Black, and male-role identities and their development. These 'multiple identities' intersect in unique ways which negate a siloed examination; necessitating a more complicated and layered understanding of Black males which surpasses a surface-level understanding of identity, delving deeper into the intricacies of the Black male in America. Bearing this in mind, this article explores moral identity and development with a focus on the intersection of race and gender. The authors' address this purpose by: a) discussing morality and related concepts; b) examining foundational literature on moral identity development; c) identifying unique considerations for Black morality; d) understanding Black Identity in relation to moral concepts; e) examining Black male gender-roles in relation to morality and moral depictions of Black males; and f) proposing a conceptual model of Black male moral identity development. Overall, this manuscript negates Eurocentric conceptions of morality by illustrating the importance of Black community values of collectivity and agency. Morality & Related Concepts Morality is a concept closely related to that of ethics (Exley, 2003-04). According to Starratt (2004) while ""Ethics is the study of what constitutes a moral life ... Morality is the living, the acting out of ethical beliefs and commitments"" (p. 5). Key to these definitions is the delineation between belief (thought) and behaviors (action). Given this notion, morality is a twofold concept entailing both one's commitment to 'good' courses of action as well as one's actualization of those commitments. The twofold nature of this concept is necessitated by the reality that moral commitments and moral actions are not always synonymous. For instance, an individual may have the ability to reason and internalize moral commitments without performing those moral actions, or performing them irregularly. Further, one may engage in seemingly moral actions (i.e., protectionism or seeking the betterment of family, friends, and local community) or display moral characteristics (e.g., tolerance, friendliness, conscientiousness) without a commitment to moral beliefs (Hart, Atkins, & Ford, 1998). Engaging in moral behavior requires a capacity to employ moral reasoning and moral judgment. Moral reasoning refers to the rationalization process of whether decisions, actions, or behaviors are morally grounded (Woolfolk, 2008). Moral reasoning is impacted by moral affect, the emotional element of moral considerations, typified by feelings of guilt, fulfillment, and confidence associated with ethical concerns (Shaffer & Kipp, 2010). Once decisions have been rationalized, individuals formulate judgments. When those judgments align with their moral convictions; they are referred to as moral judgments. As individuals become more committed to actions which demonstrate moral reasoning and moral judgments their identity as moral beings take form. …",,2013,0,9,2,False,,944,116421307,Erica Neeganagwedgin,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,Review
937,Critical Whiteness Studies: Potentiale und Grenzen eines wissenspolitischen Projekts,"Critical Whiteness Studies, as they 
emerged in the U. S., attempt a critical 
understanding of whiteness as unmarked 
yet dominating social category and position. 
In many instances, authors who are 
engaged in this field of scholarship are 
convinced that color-blind patterns of 
argu mentation, whether in academic 
work or in politics, foster racism – and 
that addressing issues of »race«, especially 
addressing issues of whiteness, is therefore 
an appropriate tool of antiracism. In this 
essay, Ina Kerner assesses strengths and 
limits of this project for critiquing racism 
in contemporary Germany. Drawing on 
the current critical whiteness debate and 
on critical whiteness scholarship in that 
country, she suggests ways in which the 
core insights of Critical Whiteness Studies 
might be adapted to also fulfill their 
normative tasks in a context that historically 
differs from the one this field of inquiry 
was developed in. She also points to 
self-limitations of the current German

938,"»im Grunde genommen hab ich die Seele eines kleinen Mädchens« – Männlichkeitsbilder, internalisierter Heterosexismus und gesundheitliches Risikoverhalten bei schwulen Männern in Deutschland","Die Thematisierung von Sexismus hat in den letzten Jahren in medialen, politischen und sozialwissenschaftlichen Debatten eine bemerkenswerte Konjunktur erfahren (vgl. z. B. Hergenhan 2012; Diehl / Rees / Bohner 2013). In diesem Sprechen über Sexismus bezeichnet der Begriff in der Regel ein System geschlechtsspezifisch wertender Wahrnehmungsund Verhaltensweisen, das gesellschaftliche Machtverhältnisse zwischen Frauen und Männern sowohl ref lektiert als auch performativ festigt (z. B. Eckes 2008; Gianettoni / Rouxvals 2010). Auch in aktuellen Debatten, in denen etwa ein ambivalenter, in »feindlichen« und »wohlwollenden« Ausprägungen sich äußernder Sexismus konstatiert (z. B. Barreto u. a. 2010; Mosso u. a. 2013) oder die Frage nach Männern als Opfer von Sexismus gestellt wird (z. B. Benatar 2003; Digby 2003), erscheinen Frauen und Männer als Kollektivsubjekte. Darin spiegelt sich jene biologistische Konstruktion binärer Geschlechterkategorien wider, die den konstatierten sexistischen Wahrnehmungen und Verhaltensweisen zugrunde liegen. Mit Ausnahme vor allem intersektioneller Ansätze (z. B. Kerner 2009; Dietze 2012) wird »den Männern« in diesen Debatten regelmäßig heterosexuelles Begehren unterstellt. Dies beeinträchtigt das Potenzial des Begriffs Sexismus zur Analyse der Aufrechterhaltung einer hierarchischen Geschlechterungleichheit, an der Menschen unterschiedlichen Geschlechts und unterschiedlicher Begehrensstrukturen beteiligt sind. Ausgehend von sozialkonstruktivistischen Ansätzen der Genderund Queer Studies, die nicht nur das Kollektivsubjekt »der Frauen« problematisieren (Butler 1991), sondern auch das Feld intelligibler Männlichkeiten differenzieren (Connell 2006), ermöglicht der Begriff indes auch die konzeptionelle und empirische Erfassung von Wahrnehmungen, Einstellungen und Verhalten gegenüber und von daraus sich ergebenden Folgen für Männer, die in heteronormativ und patriarchalisch strukturierten Gesellschaften aufgrund von Zuschreibungen »abweichender« Sexualität(en) marginalisiert werden: Als Heterosexismus bezieht er sich auf stigmatisierende Diskurse und Praktiken, die sich auf nicht-heteronor-",,2013,0,0,0,True,,946,79672327,J.

939,To See from Below: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Mandates and Feminist Ethics,"Scholars celebrate Dietrich Bonhoeffer as a “prophet of justice for the oppressed” who identified the need “to see the great events of world history from below.” But few address the thorniest aspect of Bonhoeffer’s ethics for the marginalized: the mandates or divine commissions in church, marriage, work, and government made concrete within certain orders of relationship and authority. Bonhoeffer’s marriage mandate poses particular problems as it reinforces unjust social structures. Fortunately, striking similarities between Bonhoeffer’s ethics and feminist thought—attention to concrete contexts, the role of emotion in moral reasoning, opposition to harmful dualisms, and emphasis on relationality—suggest that feminists are well-placed to critique and reconstruct Bonhoeffer’s account. Construing the mandates as contexts for “genuine communities of argument” repurposes them to combat rather than condone injustice.",,2013,64,5,0,False,,947,2069305627,G. Carter,,,,,,,,,,,History,

944,Narratives from Within: Black Women and Schooling in the Canadian Context,"This paper focuses on the educational experiences and narratives of women of African ancestry in Canada, and is based on a number of women who were interviewed over a two-month period. The literature review examines the ways in which today’s experiences of formal education, which were shared by the women, are shaped and circumscribed by much broader historical social conditions. Overall, this paper recounts the participants’ challenges and frustrations, as well as their joy and satisfaction in navigating the educational system in Canada from kindergarten through to post-secondary schooling. However, more work needs to be done to ensure that formal education and learning are meaningful for women of African ancestry and other systemically marginalized peoples in Canada. This research found that the women have a strong sense of self despite many negative educational experiences. While some of the findings support existing literature, the interviewees themselves also recommended ways in which the educational system could be improved. This work should encourage more women of African ancestry to share their stories, and for educators, school administrators and policymakers to take notice. Cet article porte sur les experiences educatives et les recits de femmes d’origine africaine vivant au Canada. Les donnees proviennent d’entrevues aupres de ces femmes et qui se sont deroulees sur une periode de deux mois. L’analyse documentaire examine la mesure dans laquelle les experiences actuelles en education formelle, qu’ont partagees les femmes, sont faconnees et limitees par des conditions historiques et sociales bien plus vastes. Globalement, cet article raconte les defis et les frustrations, ainsi que la joie et la satisfaction de ces femmes alors qu’elles naviguent dans le systeme educatif au Canada, de la maternelle aux etudes postsecondaires. Il faut toutefois plus de travail pour que l’education formelle et l’apprentissage offrent des experiences significatives aux femmes d’origine africaine et d’autres personnes qui sont systematiquement marginalisees au Canada.

The discrimination and derogation against women in societies can be reflected in proverbs because they impact the social concepts greatly. By studying proverbs, the deep-rooted gender biased ideology in a society is observable. Persian is not a gender language, but studying 12,000 Persian proverbs through this research shows there are elements of oppression in some proverbs of this language which relate to women and violate the rights and dignity of them. 179 proverbs out of 12,000 ones include discrimination against both sexes. 84% of them include elements of semantic derogation against females and 16% include sex discrimination against males.

Evidence suggests that digital platforms display different socioeconomic opportunities to demographic groups. Our work addresses this issue by presenting a methodology and software to audit digital platforms for bias and discrimination. To demonstrate, an audit of the Facebook platform and advertising network was conducted. Between October 2019 and May 2020, we collected 141,063 ads from the Facebook Ad Library API. Using machine learning classifiers, each ad was automatically labeled by the primary marketing category (housing, employment, credit, political, other). For each of the categories, we analyzed the distribution of the ad content by age group and gender. From the audit findings, we considered and present the limitations, needs, infrastructure and policies that would enable researchers to conduct more systematic audits in the future and advocate for why this work must be done. We also discuss how biased distributions impact what socioeconomic opportunities people have, especially when on digital platforms some demographic groups are disproportionately excluded from the population(s) that receive(s) content regulated by law.",ArXiv,2020,46,8,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An audit of the Facebook platform and advertising network was conducted and the limitations, needs, infrastructure and policies that would enable researchers to conduct more systematic audits in the future are considered and presented.'}",956,39322161,A.

The authors conducted two experiments to investigate the effect of profile layout on professional impression formation. Presence or absence of photos had no impact on overall rating or likability, but interacted with profile gender. Male profiles were rated best with photo, female profiles without photo Study 1, n=264.

951,How the disadvantaged appraise group-based exclusion: The path from legitimacy to illegitimacy,"Although many forms of differential treatment based on group membership are perceived to be legitimate, disadvantaged group members’ responses to discrimination have been studied primarily in contexts in which such treatment is appraised as illegitimate. This has resulted in an impoverished understanding of differential group-based treatment and a failure to illuminate the processes by which discrimination can shift from being seen as legitimate to being viewed as illegitimate. We discuss the determinants of disadvantaged group members’ legitimacy appraisals and the de-legitimisation process, whereby forms of discrimination appraised as legitimate come to be increasingly perceived as illegitimate. Whether group-based exclusion is addressed collectively or individually depends on socio-structural factors such as the pervasiveness of discrimination, impermeability of intergroup boundaries, and the availability of cognitive alternatives to the status quo. We conclude that understanding the antecedents and consequences of legitimacy appraisals is necessary to develop a comprehensive account of disadvantaged group members’ experiences of group-based discrimination.",,2013,84,35,1,False,,959,4449524,Susanne Bruckmüller,39760573,M.

954,Preliminary assessment of the gender aspects of disaster vulnerability and loss of human life in South Africa,"South Africa has reached a medium level of human development and has a heterogeneous situation with respect to disaster risk management. In this article, a preliminary assessment of the gender aspects of disaster vulnerability and fatalities is presented. The United Nations, the Health Systems Trust and Statistics South Africa were used as data sources for the following gender-segregated values: the life expectancy at birth, unemployment rates, the human development index values, the maternal mortality rates and the number of deaths from unnatural and non-natural causes. The relevant inequality indices were then calculated and used to draw conclusions regarding the gender aspects of disaster risk management in South Africa. Results of the calculations indicate that between 1980 and 2011 men were 10% more vulnerable with respect to their health status. However, the gender differences have been decreasing in recent years. Access of women to healthcare is decreasing with time, potentially decreasing the recovery potential of whole families. Women are more economically vulnerable than men in South Africa, as they are 16.3% – 33% more likely to be unemployed than men. Educational status of both genders in South Africa is comparable based on literacy and enrolment rates at primary and secondary level.

956,The Effects of Power on Financial Aspirations and Expenditures in Poland and the UK,"AbstractThis paper presents two experiments conducted in UK and Poland on how different positions in a hierarchy of power may affect financial aspirations and declared expenditures. The authors also tried to determine whether there are any cultural differences within these relationships. The results indicate that both groups, Polish and British, show an effect of being above average as far as financial aspirations are concerned. Moreover, power appears to influence investment and education in the Polish group (experiment 1) and expenditures on entertainment in the British group (experiment 2). The results also show differences in financial aspirations between the two groups. The British expected to earn more money than the Polish and have more expensive automobiles. Additionally, the British declared higher expenditures on housing, family, and friends, as well as clothes and cosmetics, whereas Polish declared higher expenditure on entertainment and day-to-day needs.Keywords: Power; Financial aspirations; Savings; Poland; UK.IntroductionThe phenomenon of power has long intrigued and inspired numerous researchers. One of the more recent approaches to the problem of power is the self-regulation perspective (Carver & Scheier, 1998; Higgins, 1998). In this approach, power and subordination are understood as a function of two factors: access to resources and control over reward and punishment (Keltner, Gruenfeld & Anderson, 2003). These two factors trigger different motivational systems in those who have power and in those who do not. Access to, and control of, resources activates the behavioural approach system, which involves focus on opportunities and goal-attainment drive. On the contrary, lack of access to resources and the threat of punishment activate the behavioural inhibition system, which involves focus on avoiding potential threats. Individuals with or without power determine their actions according to different standards of self. Those who possess power relate their actions to aspirations, possibilities and wishes (promotional aims), while those in subordinate roles relate their actions to duties, commitments and obligations (preventative aims).Cultural background significantly shapes the dominant self-constructs, which then determine the individual's behaviour and actions (Aaker & Lee, 2001; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Lee, Aaker & Gardner, 2000). For example, in an individualistic culture one's behaviours are shaped by the construct of the independent self and the individual's actions are motivated by promotional aims. In a collectivistic culture, on the other hand, their behaviour falls under the dominant influence of the interdependent self construct, and their actions are motivated by preventative aims. Thus, power based on the dominant interdependent or independent self-construal leads to different choices and aims. Since culture may influence the dominant basis of power, power may manifest itself differently depending on the culture (Chen, Lee-Chai & Bargh, 2001; Winter, 1973).The research presented in this article investigates the relationship between power, culture and individual financial aspirations and expenditures. The findings indicate that both power and lack of power are related to differing economic aspirations (Henry, 2005) and consumption patterns (Rucker & Galinsky, 2008; Rucker & Galinsky, 2009; Zawadzka & Stru?y?ska-Kuja?owicz 2008). It is predicted that the possession of power, as opposed to subordination to power, gives rise to economic aspirations, i.e. financial aspirations and expenditures related to the attainment of one's own goals and displaying one's status. It is also predicted that the individualistic culture from which an individual originates may intensify the relationships between power and financial aspirations.Although there is some research analysing the relationship between power and economic behaviour, the results of these studies have been inconclusive. …",,2013,31,2,0,False,,964,98642031,Elías D.

957,The curious identity of Michael Field and its implications for humanities research with the semantic web,"This paper uses the case of author Michael Field, the shared writing identity of two late Victorian women, to consider the implications of embracing the semantic web for humanities research. It is argued that the ontologies prevalent today reveal a lack of nuance when it comes to the complex relationships that are the focus of much humanities research, such as the connection of names to persons, particularly with respect to authorship. Further, the current state of ontology use aside, even the sophisticated use of OWL, SKOS, or ontology alignment techniques for linking big semantic web collections stands to hinder humanities research by hiding rather than exposing difference. We use the outlier Michael Field to highlight what much of the valuable work of the humanities is about and in doing so bring to the fore the challenge of formalizing complex social meanings that can otherwise be overlooked or dismissed as a trivial technicality. As a solution the humanities community is encouraged to begin engaging more directly in the construction of semantic web tools and infrastructure.",BigData Congress [Services Society],2013,55,13,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The case of author Michael Field is used to highlight what much of the valuable work of the humanities is about and in doing so bring to the fore the challenge of formalizing complex social meanings that can otherwise be overlooked or dismissed as a trivial technicality.'}",965,89724113,Lucas Hilderbrand,,,,,,,,,,,Art,
958,"Masculine attitudes of superiority deter men from accessing antiretroviral therapy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","Background This article presents part of the findings from a larger study that sought to assess the role that gender relations play in influencing equity regarding access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Review of the literature has indicated that, in Southern and Eastern Africa, fewer men than women have been accessing ART, and the former start using ART late, after HIV has already been allowed to advance. The main causes for this gender gap have not yet been fully explained. Objective To explore how masculinity norms limit men's access to ART in Dar es Salaam. Design This article is based on a qualitative study that involved the use of focus group discussions (FGDs). The study employed a stratified purposive sampling technique to recruit respondents. The study also employed a thematic analysis approach. Results Overall, the study's findings revealed that men's hesitation to visit the care and treatment clinics signifies the superiority norm of masculinity that requires men to avoid displaying weakness. Since men are the heads of families and have higher social status, they reported feeling embarrassed at having to visit the care and treatment clinics. Specifically, male respondents indicated that going to a care and treatment clinic may raise suspicion about their status of living with HIV, which in turn may compromise their leadership position and cause family instability. Because of this tendency towards ‘hiding’, the few men who register at the public care and treatment clinics do so late, when HIV-related signs and symptoms are already far advanced. Conclusion This study suggests that the superiority norm of masculinity affects men's access to ART. Societal expectations of a ‘real man’ to be fearless, resilient, and emotionally stable are in direct conflict with expectations of the treatment programme that one has to demonstrate health-promoting behaviour, such as promptness in attending the care and treatment clinic, agreeing to take HIV tests, and disclosing one's status of living with HIV to at least one's spouse or partner. Hence, there is a need for HIV control agencies to design community-based programmes that will stimulate dialogue on the deconstruction of masculinity notions.",Global Health Action,2013,63,46,3,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""It is suggested that the superiority norm of masculinity affects men's access to ART, and there is a need for HIV control agencies to design community-based programmes that will stimulate dialogue on the deconstruction of masculinity notions.""}",966,3298993,V.

A total of 277 (50.5%) men and 272 (49.5%) women participated, among whom there were 63 managers. The methodology shows a double perspective of how employees understand and perceive the differences between male and female business leaders and how managers see themselves exercising this leadership. No significant differences have been perceived. Both men and women believe they make their employees feel good about exercising leadership (M = 42.11%, W = 48.00%) quite often.

A total of 554 German-speaking volunteers from the community, mainly in Austria, completed measures of consideration of cosmetic surgery and three measures of sexist attitudes, while a subset of participants in romantic relationships completed a measure of endorsement of cosmetic surgery for their partners along with the measures of sexism. Preliminary analyses showed that women and single respondents were more likely to consider having cosmetic surgery than men and committed respondents, respectively. Further analyses showed that consideration of cosmetic surgery for oneself was significantly associated with sexist attitudes, particularly hostile attitudes to women. In addition, among participants in a relationship, sexist attitudes were associated with endorsement of cosmetic surgery for one's partner.

OBJECTIVE To report national estimates of adolescent sexual violence perpetration and details of the perpetrator experience. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected online in 2010 (wave 4) and 2011 (wave 5) in the national Growing Up With Media study. Participants included 1058 youths aged 14 to 21 years who at baseline read English, lived in the household at least 50% of the time, and had used the Internet in the last 6 months. Recruitment was balanced on youths' biological sex and age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Forced sexual contact, coercive sex, attempted rape, and completed rape. RESULTS Nearly 1 in 10 youths (9%) reported some type of sexual violence perpetration in their lifetime; 4% (10 females and 39 males) reported attempted or completed rape. Sixteen years old was the mode age of first sexual perpetration (n = 18 [40%]). Perpetrators reported greater exposure to violent X-rated content. Almost all perpetrators (98%) who reported age at first perpetration to be 15 years or younger were male, with similar but attenuated results among those who began at ages 16 or 17 years (90%). It is not until ages 18 or 19 years that males (52%) and females (48%) are relatively equally represented as perpetrators. Perhaps related to age at first perpetration, females were more likely to perpetrate against older victims, and males were more likely to perpetrate against younger victims. Youths who started perpetrating earlier were more likely than older youths to get in trouble with caregivers; youths starting older were more likely to indicate that no one found out about the perpetration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sexual violence perpetration appears to emerge earlier for males than females, perhaps suggesting different developmental trajectories. Links between perpetration and violent sexual media are apparent, suggesting a need to monitor adolescents' consumption of this material. Victim blaming appears to be common, whereas experiencing consequences does not.

We further test a dual mediation hypothesis suggesting that RWA and SDO differentially mediate the indirect effects of distinct combinations of personality traits and social worldviews on these policy attitudes. The hypothesized model provided a reasonable fit in a large New Zealand sample (N = 6,886). Policy attitudes thus consist of at least two dimensions: social versus economic.

969,"“You know the homophobic stuff is not in me, like us, it’s out there”. Using Participatory Theatre to challenge heterosexism and heteronormativity in a South African school","Forum Theatre (FT), a participatory improvised theatre form, raises consciousness, enables debate and critical reflection, and encourages a democratic form of knowledge production that engages the audience in their own learning and unlearning. I used FT as a platform to understand how 15- to 18-year-old learners, in a co-educational school in the Free State, experience and respond to heterosexism and heteronormativity. In this article, I explore whether FT sessions, based on the sociodramatic theories of Boal, are a sufficient enough construct to challenge heterosexism. Data collected for this article included videotapes of the performances, discussions, and field notes. The FT scenes and subsequent discussions suggest that young people bemoan heterosexism and heteronormativity in their school and demonstrate a commitment to challenge extreme examples of prejudice and behaviour by their teachers and peers, yet ignore or shy away from everyday examples of heterosexist exclusions and privilege. I argue that a participatory process, such as FT, can be a useful construct to challenge heterosexism, but it is not in itself liberatory, as the issues of socialisation, privilege, and context cannot be bypassed simply through ‘participation’.",,2013,42,25,0,False,,977,108511956,J.

Nonetheless, the former showed poor socio-cognitive skills performance (cognitive flexibility, emotional recognition and cognitive empathy). Particularly in HA IPV perpetrators, the history of childhood parental rejection was associated with high hostile sexism and low cognitive empathy. Moreover, a masculinized 2D:4D ratio was associated with high anger expression and low cognitive empathy. Parental rejection during childhood and early androgen exposure are relevant factors for the development of violence and the lack of adequate empathy in adulthood. Furthermore, alcohol abuse plays a key role in the development of socio-cognitive impairments and in the proneness to violence and its recidivism.

977,"""I'm Right by Doing what my Mother Says…"": A Pilot Study Chronicling African American Single Mothers' Influence on their Daughter's Romantic Heterosexual Relationships","Recent research avows African American daughters learn to love and exercise resilience through direct and vicarious interactions with their mother. While little research thoroughly elucidates the African American mother-daughter relationship, even fewer studies explore the African American single mother's influence on her daughter's perception of men and romantic heterosexual relationships. For the purpose of this qualitative pilot study, Social Learning Theory and Black Feminist Thought were selected as theoretical paradigms, and Narrative Analysis as an applicable method for analyzing the data. Findings revealed, consistent with previous research, African American daughters revere their mother. Moreover, these daughters unconsciously replicate their mother's romantic relationships, comply with their mother's lessons on men and relationships, imitate their mother's demeanor, and select mates whose affect and behavior parallel their father's. Preliminary conclusions indicate the mother-daughter relationship is essentially the barometer by which the daughters gauged their own romantic relationships.",,2013,0,2,0,False,,985,1738932,A.

In the current research, three studies investigated the effects of exposure to sexist humor on men’s rape proclivity. In Study 1, male students were exposed to either sexist or non-sexist jokes. Males exposed to sexist jokes reported higher levels of rape proclivity in comparison to males exposed to non-sexist jokes. Study 2 was an online study in which we replicated Study 1, but also measured male participants’ levels of hostile and benevolent sexism. Study 3 was a replication of Study 2, in which we controlled for the sexual content of the jokes. Overall, the results of Study 2 and Study 3 indicated that men who scored high (vs. low) on hostile sexism reported higher levels of rape proclivity after exposure to sexist versus non-sexist jokes.

How Gender and Status Moderate Negotiation Success,"The backlash effect is a well-documented negative social reaction toward women who are seen as violating gender norms because they engage in counterstereotypical (noncommunal, agentic) behaviors during the performance of their jobs. This social disincentive has been shown to account for women's diminished likelihood to initiate negotiations relative to men. But we question whether women who ignored this disincentive and initiated negotiations would even receive the resources they requested. We extend past research by showing women also incur financial penalties for initiating negotiations. This financial penalty can be explained by women's lower ascribed status relative to men's status and fortunately can be attenuated if women have achieved status. In two studies, we find consistent evidence that women who ask do not receive unless they have externally conferred status.",,2013,60,61,5,False,,994,5106368,Femina P.

987,The Reappropriation of Stigmatizing Labels: The Reciprocal Relationship Between Power and Self-Labeling,"We present a theoretical model of reappropriation—taking possession of a slur previously used exclusively by dominant groups to reinforce another group’s lesser status. Ten experiments tested this model and established a reciprocal relationship between power and self-labeling with a derogatory group term. We first investigated precursors to selflabeling: Group, but not individual, power increased participants’ willingness to label themselves with a derogatory term for their group. We then examined the consequences of such self-labeling for both the self and observers. Selflabelers felt more powerful after self-labeling, and observers perceived them and their group as more powerful. Finally, these labels were evaluated less negatively after self-labeling, and this attenuation of stigma was mediated by perceived power. These effects occurred only for derogatory terms (e.g., queer, bitch), and not for descriptive (e.g., woman) or majority-group (e.g., straight) labels. These results suggest that self-labeling with a derogatory label can weaken the label’s stigmatizing force.",,2013,17,58,6,False,,995,50753467,A. Payne,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

991,Regulating Latina Youth Sexualities through Community Health Centers,"This article examines the regulation of Latina youth sexualities in the context of sexual and reproductive health care provision. In-depth interviews with health care providers working in two Latino-serving community health centers are analyzed for how they interpret and respond to the sexual and reproductive practices of their low-income Latina teen patients. The author finds that providers emphasize teenage pregnancy as a social problem among this population to the exclusion of other dimensions of youth sexualities and encourage Latina girls’ adherence to a life course trajectory that conforms to middle-class, heteronormative ideals as a solution to this problem. By relying on such understandings, providers construct meanings of sexual citizenship that require participation in bourgeois heteronormativity. These findings suggest that Latino-serving community health centers, their providers, and their teen patients could benefit from questioning the assumptions that inform providers’ appraisals of Latina youth and developing a more inclusive approach to Latina youth sexualities beyond a discourse of pregnancy prevention. Such efforts could allow community health centers to actively participate in disrupting the structural inequalities that shape their young patients’ lives.",,2013,72,58,8,False,,999,6233781,M.

992,"Embracing Diversity and Avoiding ACRASH by Calling Spades, Progressing Syntaxes, and Affirming Actions","Despite greater awareness that the American population and workforce are increasingly diverse, there is little appreciation for the persistent and discrepant effect of difference on the lived experiences of social outsider groups. Consistent with a history of preference for able-bodied, well off, White, mature, heterosexual, males, for example, most U.S. institutions continue to be hegemonic. Proffering a road map for managing diversity and equalizing life chances across multiple spaces, this paper articulates an innovative conceptual framework called ACRASH. This powerful analogy and acronym (for ableism, classism, racism, ageism, sexism, and heterosexism) denotes the primary dimensions of difference that spawn discrimination, harassment, and prejudice and shape disparate realities for Americans.

995,Examination of Ethnic and Policy Issues in Grooming Preferences and Ethnic Hairstyles of African American Women in Corporate America,"For a century, college-trained, professional racial minorities, specifically African American women with a preference in grooming methods, have contributed to the labor market; however, in the new millennium, they are often discriminated against, scoffed at, isolated, and demoralized based on ethnic hairstyles. Research studies have distinguished a depth of research on this and conversely there are limited studies on racial minorities, in particular among grooming preferences in ethnic hairstyles. Studies have shown that in progressive companies, racial minorities and African American women who wear ethnic hairstyles had their employment terminated with prejudice. With regard to these case studies and findings, one could argue that in this nation there is freedom of speech and inequality in expression. For this reason, this research is very necessary to discover variables in ethnic and policy issues in grooming preferences with regard to the ethnic hairstyles of African American women as it relates to employers, whereas cohesive practices in diversity and policies address imposing constructs in the labor market. This research will not address every ethnical concern in the labor market; yet, it responds to a call in the literature to define managerial deficiencies against racial minorities, in particular, African American women in grooming preferences.",,2011,41,1,1,False,,1003,36384910,Benedict Tay Tiong Chee,2737241,T.

У словеначком друштву су у социјализму, нарочито у 70-им и 80-им годинама 20. века, успостављене кључне институционалне основе за њено укидање (пре свега дискриминације жена). Тај процес се додуше одвијао „у сенци“ претњи о губљењу „праве женскости“ чији би главни непријатељ био социјализам. Зато су по укидању самоуправног социјализма и преструктурирању друштва према неолибералистичком обрасцу, у име „модернизације“ и уз рекатолизацију, ојачале тежње за редоместикацијом жена и враћањем њиховој „природној“ друштвеној улози. Овај рад одговара на питање како се оживљена вишедимензионална мизогина оријентација одражава у свести одраслих становника. Подаци међународних и домаћих истраживања у оквиру SJM од 1991. до 2012. показују (делимично и полно различито) мењање колективне свести о неједнакости полова: од егалитаристичке преко ретрадиционалистичке у деведесетим до оснажене преовлађујуће егалитаристичке оријентације с неким традиционалистичким примесама на почетку 21. века. Кључне речи: дискриминација жена, друштвена неједнакост полова, једнакосна вредносна оријентација,(пост)социјализам, рекатолизација.  Abstract Due to the long-lasting androcentric order, social gender inequality suffuses all subsystems of social structure. During the socialist period, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, the key institutional bases for its elimination (primarily the discrimination against women) were established. However, this process was occurring “in the shadows” of threats of the loss of “proper femininity”, which is said to be threatened the most by socialism. After the abolition ofself-management socialism and the re-structuring of society according to the neo-liberal pattern, in the name of “modernization” and accompanied by re-catholicization, the endeavours to renewwomen redomestication and return them to their “natural” social role werereinforced. Thispaper answers the question of how the revived multidimensional misogynist orientation is expressed in the awareness of the adult population. The data collected by ISSP and EVS (within the Slovenian public opinion) investigations from 1991 to 2012 show (partially and gender dependent) a changein the collective consciousness regarding gender inequality –from the egalitarian orientation,through re-traditionalistic in the 1990s, to the reinforced prevalent egalitarian orientation with some traditionalist additions at the beginning of the 21st century.

1000,"[Gender differences in the perception of professional achievement in family medicine, Spain].","BACKGROUND
The concept of achievement is important to study the professional development. In medicine there are gender inequalities in career. The purpose was to know and compare the professional achievement's perceptions and attributions of female and male primary care physicians in Andalusia.


METHOD
Qualitative study with 12 focus groups (October 2009 to November 2010).


POPULATION
primary care physicians.


SAMPLE
intentionally segmented by age, sex and health care management. Were conducted by sex: two groups with young physicians, two groups with middle aged and two with health care management. TOTAL: 32 female physician and 33 male physicians. Qualitative content analysis with Nuddist Vivo.


RESULTS
Female and male physicians agree to perceive internal achievements and to consider aspects inherent to the profession as external achievements. The most important difference is that female physician related professional achievement with affective bond and male physician with institutional merit. Internal attributions are more important for female physician who also highlight the importance of family, the organization of working time and work-family balance. Patients, continuing education, institutional resources and computer system are the most important attributions for male physician.


CONCLUSIONS
There are similarities and differences between female and male physicians both in the understanding and the attributions of achievement. The differences are explained by the gender system. The perception of achievement of the female physicians questions the dominant professional culture and incorporates new values in defining achievement. The attributions reflect the unequal impact of family and organizational variables and suggest that the female physicians would be changing gender socialization.",Revista Española de Salud Pública,2013,29,1,0,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The perception of achievement of the female physicians questions the dominant professional culture and incorporates new values in defining achievement and suggest that the female Physicians would be changing gender socialization.'}",1008,32494571,A.

Results showed that objectification does not affect the perception of competence, but increases the estimated pay. For high-status jobs, the effect of objectification interacts with gender, increasing women's fit for a masculine job and decreasing men's fit for a feminine occupation. Finally, objectification increases the suitability for low-status jobs, and this is particularly true for women holding service-oriented professions.

1005,Associations of gender and age groups on the knowledge and use of drug information resources by American pharmacists,"Objective To explore knowledge and use of drug information resources by pharmacists and identify patterns influenced by gender and age-group classification. Methods A survey questionnaire was mailed nationwide to 1,000 practitioners working in community (n = 500) and hospital (n = 500) settings who answer drug information questions as part of their expected job responsibilities. Responses pertaining to drug information resource use and knowledge of different types of drug-related queries, resource media preferences, and perceived adequacy of resources maintained in the pharmacy were analyzed by gender and age group. The t statistic was used to test for significant differences of means and percentages between genders and between age groups. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize other findings. Results Gender and age group classification influenced patterns of knowledge and use of drug information resources by pharmacists. They also affected pharmacists’ perceptions of the most common types of questions prompting them to consult a drug information reference, as well as the resources consulted.

1006,LOS ALUMNOS MÁS CAPACES EN ESPAÑA. NORMATIVA E INCIDENCIA EN EL DIAGNÓSTICO Y LA EDUCACIÓN THE MOST CAPABLE STUDENTS IN SPAIN. NORMATIVE AND INCIDENCE IN DIAGNOSIS AND EDUCATION,"RESUMEN El presente estudio analiza la regulacion nacional y regional sobre la educacion de los mas capaces Se concluye que la LOGSE (1990), que impulso la atencion a la diversidad, omitio toda referencia a estos alumnos, situacion que corregiria parcialmente en sus desarrollos normativos posteriores. Las Comunidades Autonomas han regulado el tema de forma desigual y se refleja en la diversidad de procesos de diagnostico y respuesta educativa existentes. En la educacion primaria se diagnostican 1,3 veces mas alumnos que en la secundaria obligatoria y seis veces mas que en bachillerato. Existen en similar proporcion en los centros publicos y privados-concertados siendo la media nacional de alumnos diagnosticados con alta capacidad del 0,08%, proporcion raquitica para los parametros habituales en el desarrollo del talento y la educacion excelente. Dos tercios de los identificados son varones, preponderancia que parece ligada a estereotipos de genero pues no se da entre los alumnos con rendimiento excelente en los estudios PISA (2006, 2009), ni en los alumnos con Premio Extraordinario de Bachillerato o Beca de Excelencia (Jimenez et al., 2006, 2010). ABSTRACT The study analyses the national and regional (Autonomous Communities, AC) regulations for the education of highly gifted students, and the impact on their identification and educative intervention. We conclude that the LOGSE (General Organic Regulation of the Education System in Spain, 1990), which prompted the attention to diversity, failed to mention these students, though this situation was partially modified in subsequent developments of the law. The AC have regulated this issue differently, which is seen in the diversity of processes of diagnosis used, and the types of attention given to the learning needs of these students, as well as in the proportion of identified students found within these programs. We come across that there is 1.3 times more students identified in primary schools programs than in secondary, and six times more than in high school. Proportions are similar both in public and state-subsidized schools. The national average for high ability students is 0.8%, a paltry proportion in the context of usual parameters on development of talent and excellent and equitable education for all students. Two thirds of the identified students are male, and this preponderance seems to be linked to gender stereotypes, because it is not found among students with excellent performance from PISA studies (2006, 2009) , nor among students with High School Awards or with Excellence scholarships (Jimenez et al., 2006, 2010).",,2014,10,12,0,True,,1014,1700199,Nick Feltovich,5514761,L.

1013,"Adherence to evidence-based therapies after acute coronary syndrome: a retrospective population-based cohort study linking hospital, outpatient, and pharmacy health information systems in Valencia, Spain.","BACKGROUND
Pharmacological secondary prevention in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has contributed substantially to reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and, overall, has undergone important improvements in recent years. Nevertheless, there is still a considerable adherence gap and opportunity for improvement.


OBJECTIVE
To assess, in a cohort of patients who survived an ACS, adherence to commonly prescribed secondary prevention drugs, factors associated to adherence, and variations among health care delivery areas.


METHODS
We combined the medical and pharmacy databases from a regional public health service in Valencia, Spain, to construct a population-based cohort of patients discharged alive after an emergency admission for an ACS to any hospital of the Valencia Health Agency in 2008. We evaluated medication adherence by determining the proportion of days covered (PDC) for each therapeutic group (antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin antagonists, and statins) in the 9 months following hospital discharge. Fully adherent patients were defined as those having enough treatment to cover 75% (PDC75) of the follow-up period.


RESULTS
The study cohort consisted of 7,462 patients. PDC75 was reached by 69.9% of patients taking antiplatelet agents, 43.3% taking beta-blockers, 45.4% taking angiotensin antagonists, and 58.8% taking statins. Approximately 18% of patients did not reach PDC75 with any treatment, while 47.6% did so for 3 or more therapeutic groups. Lower adherence was found in diagnoses other than myocardial infarction. Other factors associated with nonadherence were older age, women, having copayment, foreign born, and most comorbidities (except for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which were inversely associated, and diabetes and peripheral disease, which were not significantly associated). Health care delivery areas showed certain variability in their performance on these adherence measures that remained after the adjustment for covariates, although confidence intervals overlapped except between areas at the extremes.


CONCLUSIONS
The proportion of fully adherent patients remains suboptimal, and important improvements are still possible in secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease. The combination of electronic health information systems may be very useful for monitoring adherence and evaluating the effectiveness of adherence and other quality improvement interventions.",Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy,2013,51,54,3,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The proportion of fully adherent patients remains suboptimal, and important improvements are still possible in secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease, but health care delivery areas showed certain variability in their performance on these adherence measures that remained after the adjustment for covariates.'}",1021,1382541491,M.

While both white and black informants use the symbolic meaning of commodities as a mode of self-expression, key differences exist.

1021,Impact of Race on the Professional Lives of Physicians of African Descent,"Diversifying the physician workforce is a national priority (1). However, despite efforts to increase the numbers of minority physicians (26), people of African descent represent only 2% to 3% of practicing physicians in the United States (7). Furthermore, this proportion has not changed substantially during the past 30 years (1, 8). Understanding how race influences the work experiences of physicians of African descent is fundamental to developing effective strategies to recruit and retain a diverse physician workforce. Evidence indicates that physicians of African descent face considerable challenges because of their race. Most minority physicians report that they have experienced racial or ethnic discrimination at work (912), and rates of reported racial discrimination are highest among physicians of African descent (10, 11). Studies of physicians in academic medicine show that medical school faculty of African descent have lower job satisfaction (11, 13) and are promoted less frequently (14, 15) than their nonminority counterparts who have similar productivity and similar academic accomplishments. Although this evidence documents the substantial prevalence of race-related challenges for physicians, qualitative information to understand how physicians of African descent experience race in the workplace is lacking. The design of interventions to successfully attract, integrate, and support a diverse workforce depends on a clear understanding of the role of race in the professional lives of physicians. Therefore, we sought to characterize these experiences through in-depth interviews with physicians of African descent practicing in academic and nonacademic settings and across a range of clinical specialties. We used qualitative data analysis techniques to identify the unifying and recurrent themes that show how race shapes the work experiences of physicians of African descent. Methods Study Design and Sample We conducted a qualitative study by using in-depth interviews with 25 physicians who identified themselves as being of African descent and who practiced in 1 of the 6 New England states. People of African descent include Africans and African Americans and those from other regions of the African diaspora, such as African Caribbeans. We did not interview physicians of other races because we only studied how physicians of African descent experience race at work. We chose a qualitative approach to explore a complex and potentially sensitive topic involving social and cultural interactions that are difficult to measure quantitatively (16, 17). On the basis of principles of grounded qualitative research, we aimed to generate hypotheses from the data as opposed to testing prespecified hypotheses (1620). We recruited an information-rich and purposeful sample (16, 17) of physicians of African descent from the 6 New England states. We excluded physicians in training. We identified potential participants from the membership roster of the New England Medical Society (an organization of minority physicians); the Web-based African American physician locator, which uses membership data from the National Medical Association; community-based organizations; and regional academic institutions. We randomly selected physicians from among those who responded to an invitation to participate within the first 2 weeks. In addition, using the snowball technique (16, 17), we asked study participants to provide names of other physicians of African descent in the region. All invited physicians agreed to participate. We interviewed practicing physicians until no new themes emerged from successive interviews, that is, until thematic saturation was achieved. The research protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. We obtained verbal informed consent from participants. Data Collection One of the researchers conducted in-person, in-depth interviews (21). Interviews were racially concordant and consisted of the interviewer and an individual participant. The average length of the recorded interview was 40 minutes. Professional transcriptionists transcribed interviews, and the interviewer reviewed the transcriptions to ensure accuracy. Interviews (Figure) began with a broad question: How do you think race influences your experiences at work? Specific questions addressed negative and positive work experiences attributed to race and the influence of race on the physicians career trajectories. Probes were used to encourage participants to clarify and elaborate on their statements as necessary. Figure. Standard interview guide. Statistical Analysis In the first stage of analysis, codes were created and defined as concepts that emerged from the data in an inductive fashion (21, 22). The coding team independently coded transcripts line by line and, as needed, met as a group to reach consensus. Using the constant comparative method of qualitative analysis (21, 22), we compared coded text to identify novel themes and expand existing themes, refining the codes as appropriate until we reached a final coding structure that comprehensively defined all codes (22, 23). Using this final coding structure, the researchers independently coded 3 previously uncoded transcripts. The calculated intercoder agreement was 80%, which is considered acceptable by qualitative research standards (24). One researcher then used the final code structure to recode all transcripts. We used qualitative analysis software (ATLAS.ti 5.0, Scientific Software Development, Berlin, Germany) to facilitate data organization and retrieval (25). As recommended by experts in qualitative analysis (23), participants reviewed a summary of the data and endorsed the content of the themes after the analysis was complete. Role of the Funding Sources The funding sources had no role in the design, analysis, or reporting of the study or in the design to submit the manuscript for publication. Results Physician participants represented a range of practice settings, specialties, and ages (Table). Five recurrent themes characterized how physicians of African descent experienced race in the health care workplace: 1) awareness of race permeates the experience of physicians of African descent in the health care workplace; 2) race-related experiences shape interpersonal interactions and define the institutional climate; 3) responses to perceived racism at work vary along a spectrum from minimization to confrontation; 4) the health care workplace is often silent on issues of race; and 5) these experiences can result in what we term racial fatigue, with personal and professional consequences for physicians. We provide verbatim quotations to illustrate each theme. Table. Characteristics of the 25 Study Participants* Awareness of Race Permeates the Experience of Physicians of African Descent in the Health Care Workplace All participants described race as pervading their identity and experiences in the health care workplace. Physicians offered several examples of how race often influenced their professional experiences. A general surgeon at an academic institution commented on his perception of how he is viewed by others at work: I think race permeates every aspect of my job; so when I walk onto a ward or on the floor, Im a black guy before Im the doctor. Im still a black guy before Im the guy in charge, before Im the attending of record, so that permeates everything. Participants also described the importance of race in influencing their self-view in the workplace. For some physicians, the influence of race on self-view was shaped by the participants country of origin. A general internist at an academic institution who is from the United States reflected: I am your classic African American. What I mean by that is that I think about race all the time. At least 50 times a day. I wouldnt say race has influenced me. It defines me. It defines what I do. [It defines] everything. In contrast, a physician practicing family medicine at an academic institution who immigrated to the United States as an undergraduate student stated: Race influences the personalities of Americans much more deeply than for Africans or other people not born in this country. As an African, my primary mode of identification is not race. Still, most people [in this country] see me and for them its race. [S]o it definitely affects what I do. Its probably the most important thing. Regardless of where they were from, participants reported constant awareness of their racial minority status in the workplace. However, physicians sometimes tried to take the focus off of race in the workplace. An internal medicine subspecialist working at a hospital-based practice reflected: Growing up as I did in this country, however, I am perpetually aware of race with every individual that I meet, my cofaculty, my patients, the other health care workers here, but I think I have tried to take an approach that to whatever extent possible, I try to take race out of the equation. Regardless of whether participants focused on the influence of race at work, they reflected on the intersection of authority and race in their work lives. A pediatrician at an academic institution said the following: It is hard being a physician of color because you have the issue of race and the issue of power. When you are a physician, you have a power position that other people dont have, whether they are of the same race or different race or whatever. So, sometimes it is tricky. Are you annoyed that I am in the position that I am in or [are you] annoyed about my position because of my race? Race-Related Experiences Shape Interpersonal Interactions and Define the Institutional Climate Race influenced the professional lives of all participants.

1024,"Weight Status, Body Image and Bullying among Adolescents in the Seychelles","We investigated the relationship between being bullied and measured body weight and perceived body weight among adolescents of a middle-income sub Saharan African country. Our data originated from the Global School-based Health Survey, which targets adolescents aged 13–15 years. Student weights and heights were measured before administrating the questionnaire which included questions about personal data, health behaviors and being bullied. Standard criteria were used to assess thinness, overweight and obesity. Among 1,006 participants who had complete data, 16.5% (95%CI 13.3–20.2) reported being bullied ≥3 days during the past 30 days; 13.4% were thin, 16.8% were overweight and 7.6% were obese. Categories of actual weight and of perceived weight correlated only moderately (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.37 for boys and 0.57 for girls; p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, both actual obesity (OR 1.76; p = 0.051) and perception of high weight (OR 1.63 for “slightly overweight”; OR 2.74 for “very overweight”, both p < 0.05) were associated with being bullied. In multivariate analysis, ORs for categories of perceived overweight were virtually unchanged while ORs for actual overweight and obesity were substantially attenuated, suggesting a substantial role of perceived weight in the association with being bullied. Actual underweight and perceived thinness also tended to be associated with being bullied, although not significantly.

1028,Examining ICD-10 coding for family violence within a New Zealand District Health Board,"Family violence is a significant public health problem affecting women internationally and in New Zealand. Health surveillance is needed to inform an effective health care system response and monitor change over time. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) coding system is an accessible data source of hospital discharge information. The purpose of the current research was to examine the use of family violence ICD-10 coding in one District Health Board. An electronic report of discharges for all women aged 15 to 74 years in whom a family violence ICD-10 discharge code was designated over a three year period will be compiled. Of the admissions in the study three year period, a family violence code, representing less than 1% was found. This research will highlight the importance of family violence assessment, documentation and coding within the health system. Health system family violence surveillance can be used to examine the association between family violence and health, as well as to monitor changes over time. Future research should assess tactics for recognizing and overcoming impediments to identification and coding of family violence. CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Family violence has been a concentrated area of health study in the past decade. Studies have helped provide insights into the cycle of violence, and the effects of family violence on children. Recently, studies have made society aware of the need to assess family violence interventions and their effects on recidivism (Stover, 2005). An ongoing supply of national and local level information about the causes, characteristics and cost of violence is the key to building a broad perception of the problem. This will bring enhanced public awareness, and enable policy-makers, researchers and others to conduct or support data collection and research. Diagnostic coding will aid in designing, developing and monitoring operative solutions (WHO, 2005b). This research investigation examined health visit diagnostic coding for family violence. Any endeavor to reduce family violence should begin with examining the number of family violence events as well as the main determinants, that is, the contributory chain of events leading to the event of family violence. A number of countries including New Zealand, use hospital discharge statistics based on the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) which has served for many decades as the main classification for information systems in particular those implemented in the health sector (O‟ Malley et al, 2005). The purpose of this study is to draw attention to the need to improve the capacity for ongoing data collection and research on violence. This research acknowledges the importance of what we have learned about the prevalence and impact of family violence. It explores the need for a more focused effort to code family violence and to obtain accurate statistics to plan services and monitor care. The research presented here emphasizes the need for coding of family violence admissions to hospitals. Also, policy makers drawing on this research must endeavor to make provisions for victims of family violence and that guidelines are set out for service providers to respond in an understanding and informed manner. Services should be aware of how those affected by family violence will gain access to services and which services they are more likely to go to for helpful interventions. Programs should be developed to respond to areas of highest need (Mulroney, 2003). In order to set this study in its proper context, the remainder of this chapter presents an overview of family violence, the various interchangeable terms and definitions used for family violence, New Zealand statistics, the effects and economic costs of family violence. STUDY AIM The purpose of this study was to examine the use of ICD coding for family violence within a New Zealand District Health Board (DHB) over a three year period. This will enable healthcare professionals to concentrate on improved awareness of the seriousness of abuse of women and provide the justification for allocating more resources to programs and policies aimed at reducing intimate partner violence. OVERVIEW FAMILY VIOLENCE Family violence is well known as a major public health issue with important physical and psychological components and implications (American Psychological Association, 1996a; Chalk & King, 1998). This identification is the result of hard work to trace prevalence, to measure potential risk and protective factors, and to implement well-designed assessment of interventions (Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 2002). Family violence is a major issue in New Zealand. It unequivocally impacts the health and wellbeing of individuals and their family or whanau within our communities (Ministry of Social Development, 2002). The Taskforce for Action on Violence within Families was created in July 2005, bringing together key leaders from government and community-based agencies, independent Crown entities and the judiciary. It put into practice its first program of action, working to achieve change across all of New Zealand in 2006. The Ministry of Justice has carried out an evaluation of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 and associated legislation in order to ensure that the legislation is working efficiently (NZ Government, 2007). This work is supported by the Taskforce. A four year campaign for action on family violence – aimed at increasing awareness of family violence – was launched. The campaign is about individuals, communities and organizations throughout New Zealand working together to say openly that family violence is not okay. The campaign‟s purpose is to point toward various forms of family violence, including child abuse and partner violence. The campaign consists of three components:  Communications including mass media advertising, an 0800 number, a website, media advocacy and resource development  Community action, including a Community Action Fund and partnerships with non-government organizations and the corporate sector.  Research and evaluation to measure and inform the campaign (NZ Government, 2007). DEFINITIONS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE The term “family violence” is used interchangeably with “domestic violence”, and there have been numerous endeavors to define it. The World Health Organization defines violence as: “The intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, mal development or deprivation “(Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi , and Lozano, 2002, p.5). Family violence is violence or abuse of any type, perpetrated by one family member against another family member. It includes child abuse, partner abuse and elder abuse. Child abuse is “the harming (physically, emotionally or sexually), ill-treatment, abuse, neglect or deprivation of any child or young person” (Children and Young Persons and Their Families Act, 1989). In New Zealand the Domestic Violence Act 1995 section 3 defines family violence as violence against a person by any other person with whom that person is, or has been, in a family relationship (Ministry of Social Development, 2002). The Act also defines violence as physical abuse, sexual abuse, and psychological abuse including, but not limited to, intimidation, harassment, damage to property, threats, and causing or allowing a child to see or hear physical, sexual or psychological abuse. Te Rito: The New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy 2002, defined family violence as “a broad range of controlling behaviors commonly of a physical, sexual and/or psychological nature which typically involve fear, intimidation, and emotional deprivation. It occurs within close interpersonal relationships” (Ministry of Social Development, 2002 p.8). Partner abuse is “physical, sexual, psychological abuse, threats, harassment, attacks on someone by a person that they are or have been in a relationship with or share a household with e. g de facto partner, husband, wife, brother, sister, and flat-mate” (Ministry of Health, 2001a p. 8). Intimate partner violence is physical or sexual violence, psychological/emotional abuse, or threat of physical or sexual violence that occurs between intimate partners (Saltzman; Fanslow, McMahon, & Shelley, 2002). Elder abuse “occurs when a person aged 65 or more, experiences harmful physical, psychological, sexual, material or social effects caused by the behavior of another with whom they have a relationship implying trust” (WDHB, 2003, p.146) NEW ZEALAND FAMILY VIOLENCE STATISTICS Family violence statistics can contribute to our awareness of the nature and prevalence of violence within New Zealand. The variations exist in data collection strategies, research methodology, disclosure rates, and social attitudes and this contributes to the complexity of the depiction that occurs. Within New Zealand, family violence is the most widespread form of violence. It is believed that one in seven families experience violence and it affects the whole family, both children and adults (Snively, 1994). 6,833 children were assessed by Child, Youth and Family Service (CYFS) in the year 2000 for neglect or abuse (Ministry of Social Policy, 2001). Furthermore, Child, Youth and Family received 31,781 care and protection notifications in the year 2002/3 and from these notifications, 7361 children or young persons were found to be abused or neglected (Ministry of Social Policy, 2004). It is suggested that abuse such as severe or cruel punishment is experienced by 4 -10% of New Zealand children. To add to this approximately 18% experience sexual abuse with estimates of sexual abuse being higher for girls (Ministry of Health, 2001a). Partner abuse results in about 400 women being hospitalized per year from assault and 11 women die a",,2008,58,0,0,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'There is a need for a more focused effort to code family violence and to obtain accurate statistics to plan services and monitor care, and the research presented here emphasizes the need for coding of family violence admissions to hospitals.'}",1036,2141776,Paula Mählck,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

1030,Gender inequality: Bad for men's health.,"Men's increased risk of death in ART programmes in sub-Saharan Africa is widely reported but poorly understood. Some studies have attributed this risk to men's poorer health-seeking behaviour, which may prevent them from accessing ART, being adherent to treatment, or remaining in care. In a multicentre analysis of 46 201 adults starting ART in urban and rural settings in South Africa, these factors only partly explained men's increased mortality while receiving ART. Importantly, the gender difference in mortality among patients receiving ART (31% higher for men than women) was substantially smaller than that among HIV-negative South Africans, where men had twice the risk of death compared with women. Yet, this extreme gender inequality in mortality, both within and outside of ART programmes, has not given rise to widespread action. Here it is argued that, despite their dominance in society, men may be subject to a wide range of unfair discriminatory practices, which negatively affect their health outcomes. The health needs of men and boys require urgent attention.",Southern African Journal of HIV Medicine,2013,26,33,2,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is argued that, despite their dominance in society, men may be subject to a wide range of unfair discriminatory practices, which negatively affect their health outcomes.'}",1038,122018457,Martin Mills,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,
1031,ANALYTIC AESTHETICS FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE? REPLY TO VIDMAR JOVANOVI Ć,"Iris Vidmar Jovanovi ć ’s (2021) ‘Applied Ethical Criticism of Narrative Art’ has a goal the significance of which can hardly be overestimated, the development of an analytic aesthetic framework for a publicly relevant ethical criticism. She employs public relevance to delineate a critique that is confined to neither the value interaction debate (VID) nor the debate about aesthetic cognitivism (AC), both of which are unique to analytic aesthetics and have little impact beyond the discipline of philosophy, let alone beyond academia. In drawing attention to the relationship between applied ethical criticism on the one hand and the VID and AC on the other, Vidmar Jovanovi ć levels a scathing indictment against the majority of philosophers of art, who are for the most part disinterested in the social and political implications of their theoretical research. In this brief reply, I begin by setting out the practical limitations of analytic aesthetics, endorsing and extending her critique. I then discuss Vidmar Jovanovi ć ’s criticism of my own contribution to AC (McGregor 2018).

The controversial media coverage of the death of Jade Goody provides a useful focus for exploring contemporary class-making. Recent sociological analyses of class representations in popular culture have demonstrated how denigration and humiliation serve as mechanisms which position sections of the white, working class (chavs) as repositories of bad taste. We argue that these are not the only (or even the most prevalent) affective mechanisms for class-making. In this article, we explore how cultural imperatives for ‘dying well’ intersect with what could be perceived as more positive or even affectionate representations of Jade to produce ‘good taste’ as naturalised properties of the middle class. As such, we demonstrate that the circulation of inequalities through precarious and dynamic cultural representations involves more complex affective mechanisms in class boundary work than is often recognised.",,2013,92,15,1,True,,1043,145100786,R.

This review essay places this proposal in conversation with political theologies on the margins, noting important points of convergence and divergence. It argues that engagement with feminist theologies would alleviate a residual church/world dualism that persists in Hunter's reflections on culture; attention to feminist and womanist critiques of redemptive suffering would allow Hunter to more thoroughly embrace his concern for “the least privileged” and the “most disadvantaged” (271); and attention to King would allow Hunter to preserve an appropriate place for politics as Christian praxis.",,2013,0,0,0,False,,1048,152140268,Paula McDonald,24412759,S.

U.S.-born Asian Americans and women who heard a positive stereotype about their group in an intergroup interaction (e.g., ""Asians are good at math,"" ""women are nurturing"") derogated their partner and experienced greater negative emotions than those who heard no stereotype. Negative reactions were mediated by a sense of being depersonalized, or ""lumped together"" with others in one's group, by the positive stereotype (Studies 1-3). Cross-cultural differences (Study 4) and an experimental manipulation of cultural self-construal (Study 5) demonstrated that those with an independent self-construal reacted more negatively to positive stereotypes than those with an interdependent self-construal. By bringing together research on stereotypes from the target's perspective with research on culture, this work demonstrates how cultural self-construals inform the way people interpret and respond to being the target of positive stereotypes.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2013,108,108,10,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""How cultural self-construals inform the way people interpret and respond to being the target of positive stereotypes is demonstrated, by bringing together research on stereotypes from the target's perspective with research on culture.""}",1049,14704496,Jared Schroeder,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

1051,Predicting success indicators of an intervention programme for convicted intimate-partner violence offenders: The Contexto Programme,"Recent legal changes in Spain have led to an important increase in the number of men court-mandated to community-based partner violence offender intervention programmes. However, just a few of those interventions have been systematically examined. This study aims to predict success indicators of an intervention programme for convicted intimate-partner violence offenders. The sample consisted of 212 convicted intimate-partner violence offenders who participated in the Contexto Programme. Three ""intervention gains"" or target criteria were established (increasing the perceived severity of violence, increasing the responsibility assumption for one's actions, and reducing the risk of recidivism). A structural equations model was tested, fitting data appropriately. Participants with major gain in recidivism risk were those who presented lower levels of alcohol consumption, shorter sentences, lower impulsivity, and a higher degree of life satisfaction. The largest gain in perceived severity was found in younger participants, participants with shorter sentences, lower alcohol consumption, higher life satisfaction, higher participation in their community, and higher self-esteem. And, finally, participants with the highest gains in responsibility assumption were older participants, participants who presented higher intimate support, higher anxiety, higher sexism, lower anger control, higher depression, higher impulsivity and higher self-esteem.",,2013,112,80,1,False,,1059,4600197,Jens Hainmueller,4026563,Dominik Hangartner,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
1052,The Development and Validation of Sexual Health Indicators of Canadians Aged 16–24 Years,"Objectives. We developed and validated a set of self-administered, multidimensional indicators of sexual health among Canadians aged 16–24 years. Methods. This study used a mixed-method qualitative and quantitative approach to develop and validate indicators of sexual health We used the four-stage Dillman method to identify, focus-test, pilot-test, and validate key metrics to measure sexual health We collected quantitative data to validate the measures through a computer-assisted self-interviewing program among a purposive sample of 1,158 people aged 16–24 years recruited from four Canadian provinces. Results. The survey contained 75 items measuring five dimensions of sexual health: (1) physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being in relation to sexuality; (2) approach to sexuality; (3) sexual relationships; (4) sexual experiences; and (5) discrimination, coercion, and violence. Principal components analysis for composite measures found seven components with eigenvalues ≥1. The factor structure was stable across gender, age, size of area of residence, and language in which the survey was completed. Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.90. Indicators of condom use at last vaginal sex, protection self-efficacy, sexually transmitted infection/HIV testing self-efficacy, and sexual orientation also showed good construct validity.

1058,Diasporan subjectivity and the dynamics of empowerment in Buchi Emecheta's Head Above Water,"Abstract The writings of diasporan African women writers capture the struggle for agency and self-definition. Writers write themselves out of confined patriarchal and hegemonic spaces by forging new subjectivities that define their positionality in the metropole. For example, Buchi Emecheta's diasporic encounter in her life writing, Head Above Water, forces her to grapple with multilayered systems of oppression (such as patriarchy, racism, classism, sexism, and nationality) that often complicate the identity of diasporan subjects. Such diasporan identity shows the fluidity and ever shifting subjectivities of subjects who constantly negotiate the myriad forces of domination in the metropole. A migrant subject like Emecheta continually has to negotiate between conflicting social and ideological discourses in order to create a space and place for herself in the metropole. I argue that finding and expressing a sense of subjectivity changes the dialog of the diaspora from one of loss to a new configuration of agency and empowerment that affect individual subjects in the diaspora.",,2013,23,1,0,False,,1066,26419268,Carol Grace Hurst,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,"Study, JournalArticle"

A Natural Experiment in Immigrant Discrimination,"We study discrimination against immigrants using microlevel data from Switzerland, where, until recently, some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. We show that naturalization decisions vary dramatically with immigrants’ attributes, which we collect from official applicant descriptions that voters received before each referendum. Country of origin determines naturalization success more than any other applicant characteristic, including language skills, integration status, and economic credentials. The average proportion of “no” votes is about 40% higher for applicants from (the former) Yugoslavia and Turkey compared to observably similar applicants from richer northern and western European countries. Statistical and taste-based discrimination contribute to varying naturalization success; the rewards for economic credentials are higher for applicants from disadvantaged origins, and origin-based discrimination is much stronger in more xenophobic municipalities. Moreover, discrimination against specific immigrant groups responds dynamically to changes in the groups’ relative size.",American Political Science Review,2013,142,288,13,True,,1067,6519917,C.

We investigated whether high gender role conflict (GRC; internal conflict with traditional gender-role stereotypes and an individual's perceived need to comply with these roles) is associated with psychological distress and HIV-related risk behaviors in a sample of African American men who have sex with men and women (MSMW).


METHODS
We analyzed baseline data collected from questionnaires completed by 400 MSMW participating in the Men of African American Legacy Empowering Self project in Los Angeles, California, in 2007 to 2010 for associations between participants' GRC and experiences of poor mental health and HIV risk outcomes.


RESULTS
MSMW who reported higher levels of GRC than other participants also reported more psychological distress, lower self-esteem, greater internalized homophobia, less HIV knowledge, lower risk reduction skills, less disclosure of same-sex behaviors to others, and more unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with female partners.

This essay reviews 418 experiments reported in 309 manuscripts from 2007 to 2019 to assess which approaches work best and why. Our quantitative assessment uses meta-analysis to estimate average effects. Our qualitative assessment calls attention to landmark studies that are noteworthy for sustained interventions, imaginative measurement, and transparency. However, 76% of all studies evaluate light touch interventions, the long-term impact of which remains unclear. The modal intervention uses mentalizing as a salve for prejudice. Although these studies report optimistic conclusions, we identify troubling indications of publication bias that may exaggerate effects. Furthermore, landmark studies often find limited effects, which suggests the need for further theoretical innovation or synergies with other kinds of psychological or structural interventions. We conclude that much research effort is theoretically and empirically ill-suited to provide actionable, evidence-based recommendations for reducing prejudice.

1078,In Defense of Parenthood : Children Are Associated With More Joy Than Misery,"and, on the contrary, report enhanced feelings of meaning, gratification, and Dolan, Such conflicting findings could be due to the use of divergent methods and measures, which makes it almost impossible to draw clear conclusions from this literature. The importance of this topic and its promi-nence in popular discourse demonstrates the need for rigorous examination of the link between parenthood and well-being, using multiple methods and broad well-being measures. To this end, we present three distinct studies that harnessed the strongest methodologies currently available to examine the relationship between parenting and well-being. Specifically, we used a large, nationally representative survey to test whether parents are happier overall than nonparents (Study 1), and we employed an experience-sampling study to test whether parents feel better on a moment-to-moment basis than nonparents do (Study 2). Finally, in Study 3, we used a within-subjects approach to examine whether parents derive more positive feelings from taking care of their children than from their other daily activities. This multimethod strategy allowed us to capture the emotional experience of parenthood more comprehensively while triangulating on the pros and cons of each individual Abstract Recent scholarly and media accounts paint a portrait of unhappy parents who find remarkably little joy in taking care of their children, but the scientific basis for these claims remains inconclusive. In the three studies reported here, we used a strategy of converging evidence to test whether parents evaluate their lives more positively than do nonparents (Study 1), feel relatively better than do nonparents on a day-to-day basis (Study 2), and derive more positive feelings from caring for their children than from other daily activities (Study 3). The results indicate that, contrary to previous reports, parents (and especially fathers) report relatively higher levels of happiness, positive emotion, and meaning in life than do nonparents.",,2012,42,117,18,False,,1086,81938269,T.

In contrast to statistical studies that have explored intersections between gender and race-ethnicity in North America, this Australia-based research suggests that gender does not bypass Indigenous (minority) female defendants.

1082,The Disputed Charity of Catholic Nuns: Dualistic Spiritual Heritage as a Source of Affliction,"In several European countries former pupils of Catholic nuns have made accusations of physical and emotional abuse. Feminist scholars have tended to perceive nuns as heroines because of their authority and their contribution to raising the social status of women. But there is also a darker side to convent education. Committees established by national governments have identified systemic factors leading to abuse in educational institutions. This article argues that these factors should include a feminist theological explanation: a dualistic, sacrificial spirituality underpinned the Rules of charitable orders and influenced the nuns’ blurred understanding of what constitutes humane treatment. Supporting evidence is drawn from testimonies of privileged pupils of convent boarding schools in the 1910s, from stories of ex-nuns who fled the convent, and from nuns who openly acknowledged the problem during Post Vatican II renewal when at last they were able to revolt against their spiritual value-systems.",,2013,4,2,1,False,,1090,8389747,Brenda A.

1084,Peer review in a changing world: An international study measuring the attitudes of researchers,"This large-scale international study measures the attitudes of more than 4,000 researchers toward peer review. In 2009, 40,000 authors of research papers from across the globe were invited to complete an online survey. Researchers were asked to rate a number of general statements about peer review, and then a subset of respondents, who had themselves peer reviewed, rated a series of statements concerning their experience of peer review. The study found that the peer review process is highly regarded by the vast majority of researchers and considered by most to be essential to the communication of scholarly research. Nine out of 10 authors believe that peer review improved the last paper they published. Double-blind peer review is considered the most effective form of peer review. Nearly three quarters of researchers think that technological advances are making peer review more effective. Most researchers believe that although peer review should identify fraud, it is very difficult for it to do so. Reviewers are committed to conducting peer review in the future and believe that simple practical steps, such as training new reviewers would further improve peer review. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",J.

However, masculinity research has been criticized for not being inclusive enough of different cultures. This study explored the cultural and relational components of masculinity by comparing 564 Turkish, Norwegian, and U.S. men’s endorsement of masculinity ideology and examining the associations between masculinity ideology and interpersonal attitudes and behavioral competencies with romantic partners and work colleagues separately for the three groups of men. Norwegian men had significantly lower scores on a measure of masculinity ideology than both Turkish and U.S. men. Canonical correlation analyses revealed that all three groups of men had significant associations between male role norms and interpersonal relationship variables, but the patterns of association differed by country. Generally, endorsement of traditional male role norms was associated with poorer interpersonal competencies for men in all three countries, although the associations were much stronger for the Norwegian sample.

By contextualizing the translation background, analyzing the discourse created by Lin Shu at the para-translation level in his translations of Haggard's works and highlighting Lin's treatment of gender, this study argues that Lin Shu appropriated Haggard's work to refresh the national imagination of China by means of a new allegory – the juvenile boy. Lin Shu adopted a gender-inclusive Chinese term, shaonian, to denote the notion “juvenile”, following Liang Qichao (1873–1929), who was influenced by the impact of translated juvenile literature on the successful transformation of Meiji Japan (1868–1912) into a powerful modern state. Through his use of an ostensibly gender-neutral term in reference only to the young male protagonist, Lin Shu exploits and extends Haggard's colonialist politics into a discourse whose intention is to mobilize male Chinese readers to rejuvenate China.",,2013,54,6,0,False,,1096,4410985,J.

1092,How did the great recession affect different types of workers ? Evidence from 17 middle-income countries,"How Did the Great Recession Affect Different Types of Workers? Evidence from 17 Middle-Income Countries This paper examines how different types of workers in 17 middle-income countries were affected by labor market retrenchment during the great recession. Impacts on different types of workers varied by country and were only weakly related to the severity of the shock. Among active workers, youth experienced by far the largest adverse impacts on employment, unemployment, and wage employment, particularly relative to older adults. The percentage employment reductions, for example, were greatest for youth in each sector of the economy, as firms reacted to the shock by substituting away from inexperienced workers. Employment rates, as a share of the population, also plummeted for men. Larger drops in male employment were primarily attributable to men’s higher initial rate of employment, although men’s concentration in the hard-hit industrial sector also played an important role. Within each sector, percentage employment declines were similar for men and women. Added worker effects among women were mild, even among less-educated workers. Differences in labor market outcomes across education groups and urban or rural residence tended to be smaller. These findings bolster the case for targeted support to displaced youth and wage employees. Programs targeted to female and unskilled workers should be undertaken with appropriate caution or empirical support from timely data, as they may not benefit the majority of affected workers.

1093,Statistical Discrimination in Stable Matchings,"Statistical discrimination results when a decision-maker observes an imperfect estimate of the quality of each candidate dependent on which demographic group they belong to [1,8]. Imperfect estimates have been modelled via noise, where the variance depends on the candidate's group ([4,6,7]). Prior literature, however, is limited to simple selection problems, where a single decision-maker tries to choose the best candidates among the applications they received. In this paper, we initiate the study of statistical discrimination in matching, where multiple decision-makers are simultaneously facing selection problems from the same pool of candidates. We consider the college admission problem as first introduced in [5] and recently extended to a model with a continuum of students [3]. We propose a model where two colleges A and B observe noisy estimates of each candidate's quality, where Ws, the vector of estimates for student s, is assumed to be a bivariate normal random variable. In this setting, the estimation noise controls a new key feature of the problem, namely correlation, ρ, between the estimates of the two colleges: if the noise is high, the correlation is low and if the noise is low the correlation is high. We assume that the population of students is divided into two groups G1 and G2, and that members of these two groups are subject to different correlation levels between their grades at colleges A and B. Concretely, for each student s, their grade vector (WAs, WBs) is drawn according to a centered bivariate normal distribution with variance 1 and covariance ρGs, where Gs is the group student s belongs to. We consider the stable matching induced by this distribution and characterize how key outcome characteristics vary with the parameters, in particular with the group-dependent correlation coefficient. Our results summarize as follows: We show that the probability that a student is assigned to their first choice is independent of the student's group, but that it decreases when the correlation of either group decreases. This means that higher measurement noise (inducing lower correlation) on one group hurts not only the students of that group, but the students of all groups. We show that the probability that a student is assigned to their second choice and the probability that they remain unassigned both depend on the student's group, which reveals the presence of statistical discrimination coming from the correlation effect alone. Specifically, we find that the probability that a student remains unmatched is decreasing when the correlation of their group decreases (higher measurement noise) and when the correlation of the other group increases. In other words, the higher the measurement noise of their own group, the better off students are with regard to getting assigned a college at all. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, but is explained by the observation that with high noise (i.e., low correlation) the fact that a student is rejected from one college gives only little information about the outcome at the other college. That is, a student has an independent second chance for admission. These two comparative static results give insights on the effect of correlation on the stable matching outcome for different demographic groups and show that indeed, statistical discrimination is an important theory to understand discrimination in matching problems. We also analyze a number of special cases of our model, in particular the case of a single group, to show that even in this case correlation affects the outcome. It is interesting to notice that the effect of correlation on the number of students getting their first choice in our model is the same as in [2], i.e., a higher correlation leads to more students getting their first choice. Our work is the first to investigate statistical discrimination in the context of matching. Overall we find that group-dependent measurement noises of the candidates quality---and the resulting group-dependent correlation between the colleges' estimates---play an important role in leading to unequal outcomes for different demographic groups, and in particular underrepresentation of one of the groups. Of course, we do not argue that statistical discrimination is the only possible cause of discrimination. In particular, if there is bias in the quality estimates for one group, then it will naturally also hurt the representation of that group. We do not model bias since our primary purpose is to isolate the effect of statistical discrimination. Throughout the paper, we make a number of other simplifying assumptions (e.g., focusing on two colleges) whose purpose is also to simplify our results and isolate the effect of correlation. Our analysis, however, extends to more general contexts.",ACM Conference on Economics and Computation,2022,11,1,1,True,,1101,48103937,K. Douglas,8534925,R. Sutton,,,,,,,,,Psychology,JournalArticle

The Role of System-Justifying Ideologies in Predicting Attitudes Toward Sexist Language,"Sexist language excludes, trivializes, or diminishes either gender. Despite efforts by many professional bodies to encourage the use of nonsexist alternatives, sexist language use persists across many languages. Furthermore, research has shown that men are less supportive of nonsexist language alternatives than women, and that this effect is mediated by attitudes toward women. We propose that broader ideologies related to the perceived legitimacy of dominance hierarchies and existing social systems also explain this gender gap. British undergraduate participants completed measures of attitudes toward women, gender-specific system justification, and social dominance orientation. They also completed an inventory of attitudes toward sexist language. There was a strong gender difference in attitudes toward sexist language that was significantly mediated by gender-specific system justification and social dominance orientation. The relationship between gender and attitudes toward sexist language therefore appears to be driven by broader ideologies that serve to keep women “in their place”.",,2014,51,29,3,True,,1110,113151717,Arthur McLuhan,47996297,D.

Their stories illustrate each of the steps in the CASCADA behaviour change model. As well as supporting an enabling environment for other interventions in the trial, the audio-drama also helped some participants to make personal changes. Collecting and discussing the stories were encouraging for the trial fieldworkers.

Rejecting the notion that these recent dramas are either “unmediated reflection[s]” of a debased contemporary society or concerned only with engendering shock, Carney argues that these works explore the tragic foreclosure of tragic experience (323). Ravenhill and Kane hold up “metaphysical absolutes” – evil and love, respectively – “within the condition of their demise” (236). The “traumatic wound” in Ravenhill is a mark of violence that both exceeds symbolization and threatens to collapse into a fetish (258); and atè, the condition of being neither living nor dead, afflicts Kane’s characters, who are “in love within a postmodern situation where love as such is impossible” (268). Carney concludes with an acute reading of Butterworth’s Jerusalem (2009), a play whose spectacular ending holds out a “moment of enchantment, of meaningfulness that . . . is only accessible to us once the dramatic passage through debasement and shock has been travelled imaginatively” (298). Carney’s materialist–formalist account of these plays is patient and rigorous, and his delineation of tragedy as a postmodern category cogent. While the plays never prescribe any particular form of political action, resistance, or relation, Carney’s study illuminates the powerful politics contained within a theatre of joy and despair.",,2014,0,0,0,False,,1116,1484701188,Heebon Park-Finch,,,,,,,,,,,Art,

The paper advocates the “undoing” of gender in this regard as helping to build a more progressive, inclusive and liberal form of physical culture, seen as a key potential of sex-integrated training. To that end, the paper makes a number of proposals for instructors and practitioners interested in developing such inclusive environments in their own clubs and training settings.",,2014,70,44,9,True,,1123,39507498,K.

1121,"Unspeakable Inequalities: Post Feminism, Entrepreneurial Subjectivity, and the Repudiation of Sexism among Cultural Workers","Work in the cultural and creative fields is marked by stark and growing inequalities relating to gender, class, and race/ethnicity. Yet, the same industries are also characterised by an ethos that celebrates openness, egalitarianism, and meritocracy. This paper explores this paradox, focusing in particular on gender inequalities. It argues that there is a need to move beyond the standard conventional explanations for women’s under-representation within the creative workforce, which point to female childbearing and childcare as central. Whilst not disputing the significance of motherhood to women’s career trajectories, the paper suggests that the repeated focus on maternity is problematic and may close down other areas of potential investigation and critique. The paper suggests that three alternative foci would repay attention in understanding inequalities in the CCI. First, the new, mobile, subtle, and revitalised forms of sexism in circulation urgently require further examination. Secondly, the power of the dominant post feminist sensibility which, in suggesting that “all the battles have been won,” renders inequality increasingly difficult to voice or speak about, demands critique. Thirdly, the new forms of labouring subjectivity required to survive in the field of cultural work may themselves be contributing to the inequalities in the field, by favouring an entrepreneurial individualistic mode that disavows structural power relations. These three aspects of life in the field of cultural work merit further attention and suggest that gender inequality has a variety of different causes, not all located in women’s childbearing abilities. Moreover, the paper argues that the very myth of egalitarianism at work in the CCI may itself be a key mechanism through which inequality is reproduced.",,2014,91,180,27,True,,1130,49531360,K.

Adopting social constructionist and interpretative approaches, this article draws on in-depth interviews with 20 women entrepreneurs in the UAE to explore the interplay between macro socio-cultural values using Hofstede’s (2001) typology of cultural values and the barriers faced during their entrepreneurial careers. The findings suggest a considerable socio-cultural impact: one that starts with family support and extends to the huge spill-over effect on the business venture itself and on women’s access to capital and business networks. They also highlight the role that women’s agency, self-confidence and persistence are playing in fostering the appetite of local women for entrepreneurship and overcoming the toll of barriers. Overall, the findings suggest that the winds of change, although mild, are nevertheless blowing through the UAE and the Arab Middle East by extension.

This picture of the existing environment was meant to serve as a first step toward creating and supporting a more humanistic academic environment. A mixed-methods approach was used for data collection during the 2009-10 and 2010-11 academic years at one U.S. dental school. Four focus groups were first conducted to explore challenges and conflicts faced by students during their dental education. A written survey informed by the focus group results was then used to obtain quantitative data. The survey response rate was 47 percent (N=188). Faculty inconsistency, cheating, and belittlement/disrespect were experienced by many of the responding dental students during their education, similar to what has been documented in medicine. These students also reported experiencing both constructive communication (90 percent) and destructive communication (up to 32 percent). The female students reported more gender discrimination and sexual harassment than their male peers, and the clinical students reported more experience with belittlement and destructive communication than the preclinical students.

1128,"Risk for coerced sex among female youth in Ghana: roles of family context, school enrollment and relationship experience.","CONTEXT
A better understanding is needed of the variables that may influence the risk of experiencing coerced sex among adolescent females in Sub-Saharan Africa.


METHODS
Data were collected from 700 female respondents who were interviewed in 2010 and 2012 waves of a longitudinal study of behavioral risk for HIV infection among youth aged 13-14 or 18-19 and living in two towns in southeastern Ghana. A series of logistic regression models examined the influences of household composition and wealth, four family process variables (behavioral control, relationship quality, financial support, conflict), school enrollment and relationship experience on females' risk of experiencing coerced sex.


RESULTS
Eighteen percent of respondents reported having experienced coerced sex prior to Wave 1, and 13% experienced it between Waves 1 and 2. In both cross-sectional and prospective models, the variable with the strongest association with having experienced coerced sex was having ever had a boyfriend (fully adjusted odds ratios, 4.5 and 2.6, respectively). In cross-sectional analyses, parental behavioral control was negatively associated with risk for coerced sex, while parental conflict was positively associated; these associations were not significant in the prospective analyses. Having a boyfriend appears to be the primary predictor of coerced sex among young females, beyond any influence of family, school or other household variables.


CONCLUSIONS

1129,"Gender-based power and couples' HIV risk in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, north India.","CONTEXT
Gender inequality is a long-recognized driver of the HIV epidemic. However, few studies have investigated the association between gender-based power and HIV risk in India, which has the world's third largest HIV epidemic.


METHODS
Population-based data collected in 2003 from 3,385 couples residing in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, North India, were used to examine associations between gender-based power (wife's autonomy and husband's inequitable gender attitudes) and indicators of couples' HIV risk (whether the husband had had premarital sex with someone other than his eventual spouse, extramarital sex in the past year or STI symptoms in the past year). Structural equation modeling was used to create composite variables for the gender-based power measures and test their associations with HIV risk measures.


RESULTS
Twenty-four percent of husbands had had premarital sex, 7% had had extramarital sex in the past year and 6% had had STI symptoms in the past year. Structural equation models indicated that wives who reported higher levels of autonomy were less likely than other wives to have husbands who had had extramarital sex in the past year (direct association) or STI symptoms in the past year (indirect association). Moreover, husbands who endorsed more inequitable gender attitudes were more likely than others to report having had premarital sex with someone other than their spouse, which in turn was associated with having had extramarital sex and STI symptoms in the past year.

1133,Risky Arguments in Social - Justice Litigation: The Case of Sex Discrimination and Marriage Equality,"This Essay takes up the puzzle of the risky argument or, more precisely, the puzzle of why certain arguments do not get much traction in advocacy and adjudication even when some judges find them to be utterly convincing. Through a close examination of the sex discrimination argument’s evanescence in contemporary marriage litigation, I draw lessons about how and why arguments become risky in social justice cases and whether they should be made nonetheless. This context is particularly fruitful because some judges, advocates and scholars find it “obviously correct” that laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage discriminate facially based on sex or impose sex stereotypes. Yet advocates have tended to minimize these arguments and most judges either sidestep or go out of their way to reject them.Certain kinds of arguments, including the sex discrimination argument in marriage cases, turn out to pose greater risks than others because they ask decisionmakers to confront long-settled social hierarchies and norms, such as those associated with gender roles. As a result, they risk inciting Burkean anxieties about the dangers of non-incremental change. Arguments that ask less of decisionmakers, such as those about animus associated with a particular enactment – or that have a more limited reach, such as heightened scrutiny for sexual orientation at a time when few explicitly antigay laws remain – are less likely to provoke that discomfort. Moreover, a win on these narrower arguments can effectively erode stereotypes and norms underlying a challenged law or social policy. In marriage cases, for example, a pro-equality ruling helps call longstanding marital gender roles into question even if the court’s decision never mentions sex discrimination. Still, risky arguments add value within litigation by powerfully calling attention to deep problems that underlie a challenged law. Through close study of these costs and benefits, the risky argument frame advanced here aims to illuminate the complex dynamics of argumentation in the litigation and adjudication of social justice cases.",,2014,39,8,0,True,,1142,5899113,Hedy Greijdanus,2827532,T.

However, at times, targets of even the most unflattering stereotypes embrace them as valid. Early stigma researchers conceptualized this self-stereotyping as a form of internalized self-hatred. However, within the last few decades, stigma researchers have challenged this notion. This more contemporary approach asserts that there are situations where endorsing negative stereotypes can actually be of use to those who are targeted by them. For instance, endorsing negative self-stereotypes can be used to help justify the status quo, fulfill assimilation and differentiation needs, and protect against personal and social threats. The purpose of the present paper is to review both traditional and contemporary explanations for the causes and consequences of negative self-stereotyping.

This article suggests that the idea of reconstruction helps to understand how apologies are mediated and evaluated. David Cameron's apology for Bloody Sunday is examined to see how he constructs four aspects of apology: social actors, consequences, categorization, and reasons. The reconstruction of those aspects by British, Unionist, and Nationalist press along with reconstructions made by soldiers in an online forum are considered. Data analysis was informed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis which helped to explore key aspects of reconstruction and how elements of Cameron's apology are altered in subsequent mediated forms of the apology. These mediated reconstructions of the apology allowed their authors to evaluate the apology in different ways.

1140,Parental support for policy actions to reduce weight stigma toward youth in schools and children's television programs: trends from 2011 to 2013.,"BACKGROUND
Despite the pervasiveness and negative physical and psychosocial implications of weight-based victimization (WBV) in youth, antibullying polices in schools rarely address this issue. Additionally, children's media perpetuates weight stigma, but regulation of stigmatizing media content is nonexistent.


METHODS
In 2011-2013, a diverse national sample of 2185 parents (n=716 in 2011, 755 in 2012, and 714 in 2013) was analyzed to evaluate parental support for four proposed policies across the 3 years. Actions addressed (1) strengthening policies to reduce weight stigma, (2) media portrayals of children with diverse body sizes, (3) media portrayals of such children engaged in healthy behaviors, and (4) antibullying policies in schools. Chi-square tests with Bonferroni's corrections and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted.


RESULTS
Across time, support for policies to address weight stigma remained consistent or increased, primarily in 2012-2013. At least 86% of participants consistently favored implementing antibullying policies in schools. Parents became increasingly supportive of policies regulating television content to positively portray children of diverse body sizes and show such children engaged in health behaviors, as well as establishing weight-related antibullying policies. Specific predictors of support included gender, race, and political affiliation.

The consequence of ST is under-performance in abilities related to the stereotype. Here, we examined the degree to which explicit and implicit memory were affected by ST across a wide age-range. We found that explicit memory was affected by ST, but only in an Early Aging group (mean age 67.83), and not in a Later Aging group (mean age 84.59). Implicit memory was not affected in either the Early or Later Aging group. These results demonstrate that ST for age-related memory decline affects memory processes requiring controlled retrieval while sparing item encoding. Furthermore, this form of ST appears to dissipate as aging progresses.

Despite efforts to reduce its prevalence, it continues to be one of the most common forms of workplace mistreatment. This article examined best practices in system-level interventions to reduce sexual harassment in the workplace and presents data from the U.S. Armed Forces to demonstrate the roles of organizational leadership, and sexual harassment policies and training, on reducing sexual harassment and improving outcomes when it does occur. We assert that a clear and consistent antiharassment message from organizational leaders is essential. This is communicated via a written, widely disseminated policy on sexual harassment; regular educational training for all members of the organization; formal and informal reporting, investigation, and remediation procedures. Finally, we suggest that organizations conduct regular self-assessments of sexual harassment and perceptions of the organizational climate as proactive efforts to effectively intervene and eliminate its occurrence.",,2014,53,112,10,False,,1152,2063682,Daniel M.

1144,Sanctioning Resistance to Sexual Objectification: An Integrative System Justification Perspective,"In this article, we describe an integrated theoretical approach for promoting resistance to the system of sexual objectification. Drawing from system justification and objectification theories, we propose a two-arm approach that would harness the system justification motive and adjust the lens of self-objectification in order to facilitate social change. We suggest that it is necessary to frame a rejection of the system of sexual objectification as a way to preserve (rather than threaten) the societal status quo. Further, we argue that it is critical to alter and expand the self-objectified lens through which many women come to view themselves in order to reduce their dependence on the system that constructs and sustains that lens. Although we recognize that multiple approaches and perspectives are needed, we argue that a disruption of the system at its ideological roots is essential to ultimately transcend sexual objectification as a cultural practice.",,2014,93,59,3,False,,1153,49514762,P.

1147,Commentary: Encouraging Confrontation,"Sexism differs from other prejudices due to intimate interdependence between the sexes, requiring gender-specific research on effective ways to confront sexist behavior. Two central themes emerge from the current issue: (i) who can confront sexism successfully and (ii) how organizations and leaders should intervene. The burden to confront often falls on female targets, who experience social costs for doing so, especially when perpetrators have greater power. Targets therefore need allies, including men, who are not perceived as having self-interested motives for confronting. Organizations—through leaders and policies—represent the most important and effective allies. Organizational priorities can determine whether female targets suffer in silence or are empowered to confront. Fortunately, there is increasing popular interest, both among women and organizations, to address barriers to women's advancement. This special issue represents an important first step, outlining promising strategies for confronting sexism.",,2014,22,12,0,False,,1156,104148922,Megan K. McCarty,6673689,N. Iannone,33584106,J.

Results (N = 152) indicated that, overall, both women and men responded most favorably to the female target who confronted nonaggressively. Nonaggressive confrontation was perceived as relatively unthreatening for women and relatively threatening for men, whereas the remaining responses were all perceived as threatening for women.

1149,Using Experiential Learning to Increase the Recognition of Everyday Sexism as Harmful: The WAGES Intervention,"© 2014 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. The harms of subtle sexism tend to be minimized despite negative cumulative effects, thus people may be less motivated to address subtle sexism. We tested the effectiveness of an experiential learning intervention, WAGES-Academic (Workshop Activity for Gender Equity Simulation-Academic), to educate about the harms of subtle sexism in the academic workplace. Across two studies, WAGES increased the recognition of everyday sexism as harmful and promoted behavioral intentions to discuss and seek information about gender inequity compared to a control condition that provided identical information as WAGES but without experiential learning. These effects were due to WAGES limiting reactance and promoting self-efficacy. Moreover, WAGES did not differ in reactance or self-efficacy compared to a control condition that provided no gender inequity information. This suggests that WAGES buffers the potential negative effects of simply presenting gender inequity information. Results suggest that WAGES, and experiential learning more broadly, has the potential to change attitudes and behaviors about everyday sexism.",,2014,39,91,2,True,,1158,6535575,Yanshu Huang,31814753,D.

The Role of Perpetrator Power in Prejudice Confrontation,"Two experiments examined the role of perpetrator power in witnesses’ decision to confront a prejudicial remark. In Experiment 1, participants who witnessed a sexist remark by a higher-power (vs. an equal-power) perpetrator were significantly less likely to express confrontation intentions, despite finding the remark highly biased and inappropriate. In Experiment 2, participants read scenarios involving a sexist versus racist remark perpetrated by someone higher vs. lower vs. equal in power, and they reported their confrontation intentions. Perpetrator power again inhibited direct confrontation intentions, and this effect was mediated by perceptions of responsibility for intervening, perceived ability to decide how to respond, and perceived costs versus benefits of confronting. Findings were not qualified by discrimination type (racism vs. sexism) or by individual differences in participant prejudice. Consistent with power-as-approach theory, feeling powerless increased sensitivity to confrontation obstacles and thereby inhibited confrontation intentions.",,2014,43,63,2,False,,1159,1422855208,Ana Vidal-Fernández,3777804,J.

However, when an upper-class wife facing prosecution with her husband for a betting fraud in 1922 successfully relied upon the defence, there was a public outcry against a doctrine that was perceived as reinforcing the ancient concept of a wife as her husband's chattel. It is argued that the abolition of the presumption, but not the doctrine itself, in the (still in force) Criminal Justice Act 1925, s 47, while reflecting changes towards a more companionate style of marriage, was primarily driven by the objectives of predominantly middle-class women's organisations.

Participants completed the Sex-Role Egalitarianism Scale and ranked the following traits in terms of their importance in choosing a potential marriage partner: kindness, physical attractiveness, social level, athleticism, creativity and liveliness. Parallel analyses for male and female participants reveal that traditional males value physical attractiveness more than egalitarian males, and that traditional females value social level more and kindness less than egalitarian females.

Depending on the experimental condition, the victim was described either as a feminist and/or as exhibiting difficulties in her relationship with others or not. A hierarchical regression analysis was performed with victim blaming as dependent variable. Participants’ hostile sexism positively predicted victim blaming when the victim was described as a feminist and as a “difficult to deal with” woman (p < .001). In addition, men, but not women, high in hostile sexist attitudes placed more blame on the victim when she was presented as a feminist woman (p < .001).

Yet, only a small minority of students evoked religious language to justify their surname choice. Gender roles, identity, and tradition were dominant themes in their explanations.

1170,Gendered Ageism and Organizational Routines at Work: The Case of Day-Parting in Television Broadcasting,"This article contributes to the study of gendered ageism in the workplace by investigating how the routine of day-parting in broadcasting participates in the social construction of an ideology of ‘youthfulness’ that contributes to inequality. Critical discourse analysis is applied to the final judgment of an Employment Tribunal court case where the British public service broadcaster, the BBC, faced accusations of discrimination on the basis of both age and gender. Three interrelated findings are highlighted. First, the ideology of youthfulness was constituted through discursive strategies of nomination and predication that relied on an inherently ageist and sexist lexical register of ‘brand refreshment and rejuvenation’. Second, the ideology of youthfulness was reproduced through a pervasive discursive strategy of combined de-agentialization, abstraction and generalization that maintained power inequality in the workplace by obscuring the agency of the more powerful organizational actors while further marginalizing the weaker ones. Third, despite evidence that the intersection of age and gender produced qualitatively different experiences for individual organizational actors, in the legitimate and authoritative version of the truth constructed in the Tribunal’s final judgment, ageism discursively prevailed over sexism as a form of oppression at work. These findings support the view that the intersection of age and gender in the workplace should be explored by taking into account different levels of analysis – individual, organizational and societal – and with sensitivity to the context. They also suggest that the notion of gendered ageism is still poorly articulated and that the lack of an appropriate vocabulary encourages the discursive dominance of ageism over sexism, making the intersection of the two more difficult to study and to address.",,2014,110,39,1,False,,1179,144647722,R.

1171,Approach or Avoid? Exploring Overall Justice and the Differential Effects of Positive and Negative Emotions,"As empirical research exploring the relationship between justice and emotion has accumulated, there have been key questions that have remained unanswered and theoretical inconsistencies that have emerged. In this article, the authors address several of these gaps, including whether overall justice relates to both positive and negative emotions and whether both sets of emotions mediate the relationship between overall justice and behavioral outcomes. They also reconcile theoretical inconsistencies related to the differential effects of positive and negative emotions on behavioral outcomes (i.e., performance, withdrawal, and helping). Across two field studies (Study 1 is a cross-sectional study with multirater data, N = 136; Study 2 is a longitudinal study, N = 451), positive emotions consistently mediated the relationship between overall justice and approach-related behaviors (i.e., performance and helping), whereas negative emotions consistently mediated the relationship between overall justice and avoidance-related behaviors (i.e., withdrawal). Mixed results were found for negative emotions and approach-related behaviors (i.e., performance and helping), which indicated the importance of considering context, time, and target of the behavior. The authors discuss the theoretical implications for the asymmetric and broaden-and-build theories of emotion as well as the importance of simultaneously examining both positive and negative emotions.",,2014,143,114,6,False,,1180,48838057,A.

1175,"Women, know your limits: cultural sexism in academia","Despite the considerable advances of the feminist movement across Western societies, in Universities women are less likely to be promoted, or paid as much as their male colleagues, or even get jobs in the first place. One way in which we can start to reflect on why this might be the case is through hearing the experiences of women academics themselves. Using feminist methodology, this article attempts to unpack and explore just some examples of ‘cultural sexism’ which characterises the working lives of many women in British academia. This article uses qualitative methods to describe and make sense of some of those experiences. In so doing, the argument is made that the activity of academia is profoundly gendered and this explicit acknowledgement may contribute to our understanding of the under-representation of women in senior positions.",,2014,95,166,14,True,,1184,49657343,Christopher D.

1178,Gendered Mental Disorders: Masculine and Feminine Stereotypes About Mental Disorders and Their Relation to Stigma,"Research indicates that stereotypes can intersect. For example, the intersection of stereotypes about gender and mental disorders could result in perceptions of gendered mental disorders. In the current research, Studies 1 and 2 showed that people view specific disorders as being masculine or feminine. The masculine stereotype included antisocial personality disorder, addictions, and paraphilias. The feminine stereotype included eating disorders, histrionic personality disorder, body dysmorphia, and orgasmic disorder. In both studies, the perception of disorders as masculine was positively correlated with stigma. Study 3 showed that the positive correlation between masculinity and stigma also occurred when examining specific symptoms rather than full mental disorders.

1181,"Attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise – social influencers’ winning formula?","
Purpose
The importance of influencer marketing is constantly growing. However, little empirical research has examined influencers’ success requirements. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring whether the requirements of influencers’ attractiveness, expertise and trustworthiness are relevant for online influencer campaigns. An entry-level luxury fashion brand is the focus of the experiment.


Design/methodology/approach
A total of 288 participants completed an online survey evaluating the profiles of influencers who varied in terms of the three abovementioned requirements. The impacts of these requirements on brand image, brand satisfaction and brand trust as well as purchase intention and price premium were tested via structural equation modeling.


Findings
The results show that the most important requirement is trustworthiness, followed by attractiveness; surprisingly, the relevance of expertise is virtually nil.


Research limitations/implications
To date, practitioners are still struggling with the success requirements of influencer marketing. They have focused on traditional advertising models and numeric requirements such as the amount of followers. However, regarding merely these requirements can result in wrong decisions. Considering the two requirements, attractiveness and trustworthiness, in a stronger way can provide a remedy to this struggle. In future research, the relevance of the requirements in different involvement conditions and for non-attractiveness-related products might be investigated.


Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first to explore the success requirements that are directly related to influencers (e.g. attractiveness) rather than numeric requirements of their profiles (e.g. page rank) and the impacts of those requirements on brand image, brand satisfaction and brand trust as well as purchase intention and price premium. It adapts the Source-Credibility Model for influencers and shows that its requirements interact in a unique way that is counterintuitive and different from other endorser types such as celebrities or salespersons.

Photovoice was used to engage 2 groups of adolescents from a rural village to document and discuss their community. Using previous theory and models of sociopolitical development as a guide, themes were identified to inform the development of a quantitative measure we call sociopolitical consciousness. New and preexisting items were combined to create a measure that reflected the themes from the qualitative data. The resulting measure was completed by 682 Salvadoran high school students across 3 different community contexts; 7 factors were subsequently identified representing both individual and collective dimensions of sociopolitical consciousness. The study demonstrates how a contextualized research process can facilitate a synergy between the emic and etic dimensions of sociopolitical development.",,2014,21,34,5,False,,1191,2110130743,Jennifer L.

1184,Understanding sexual harassment using aggregate construct models.,"Sexual harassment has received a substantial amount of empirical attention over the past few decades, and this research has consistently shown that experiencing these behaviors has a detrimental effect on employees' well-being, job attitudes, and behaviors at work. However, these findings, and the conclusions that are drawn from them, make the implicit assumption that the empirical models used to examine sexual harassment are properly specified. This article presents evidence that properly specified aggregate construct models are more consistent with theoretical structures and definitions of sexual harassment and can result in different conclusions about the nomological network of harassment. Results from 3 large samples, 2 military and 1 from a civilian population, are used to illustrate the differences between aggregate construct and reflective indicator models of sexual harassment. These analyses suggested that the factor structure and the nomological network of sexual harassment differ when modeling harassment as an aggregate construct. The implications of these results for the continued study of sexual harassment are discussed.

1186,Zoo and Aquarium Professionals' Concerns and Confidence About Climate Change Education,"ABSTRACT Educators at America's Zoos and Aquariums have the potential to have extensive impact on the public's knowledge about climate change. However, evidence suggests that educators at these institutions may not be taking full advantage of these opportunities. The present research suggests that about one-third to two-thirds of these educators would like to say more about climate change than they currently do. Anticipated audience responses to messaging were examined as a possible barrier. Results indicate that educators are not particularly concerned about those who doubt or deny climate change. Instead they are relatively more concerned about visitors' disinterest in climate change. The results suggest that, in order to increase educators' tendency to more fully say what they would like to say about climate change to visitors, it would be helpful to build educators' confidence not only about visitors' receptivity to climate change information but also their confidence in their ability to present climate change information. This includes confidence in their knowledge about how to strategically present climate change information, their ability to make connections between global climate change and local environmental problems, and their ability to reach youth audiences.",,2014,39,21,1,False,,1195,116513903,Parmis Tasharofi,70019613,S.

1187,THE EDGE OF STIGMA: AN EXPERIMENTAL AUDIT OF THE EFFECTS OF LOW‐LEVEL CRIMINAL RECORDS ON EMPLOYMENT,"Ample experimental evidence shows that the stigma of a prison record reduces employment opportunities (Pager, 2007). Yet background checks today uncover a much broader range of impropriety, including arrests for minor crimes never resulting in formal charges. This article probes the lesser boundaries of stigma, asking whether and how employers consider low-level arrests in hiring decisions. Matched pairs of young African American and White men were sent to apply for 300 entry-level jobs, with one member of each pair reporting a disorderly conduct arrest that did not lead to conviction. We find a modest but nontrivial effect, with employer callback rates about 4 percentage points lower for the experimental group than for the matched control group. Interviews with the audited employers suggest three mechanisms to account for the lesser stigma of misdemeanor arrests relative to felony convictions: 1) greater employer discretion and authority in the former case; 2) calibration of the severity, nature, and timing of the offense; and 3) a deeply held presumption of innocence, which contrasts the uncertainty of arrest with the greater certainty represented by convictions. In addition, personal contact and workplace diversity play important roles in the hiring process.",,2009,61,216,13,False,,1196,143994852,Elspeth J. R. Hill,35017928,Katherine Bowman,5839687,R.

1189,Racial and non-racial discrimination and smoking status among South African adults 10 years after apartheid,"Background Despite a long history of discrimination and persisting racial disparities in smoking prevalence, little research exists on the relationship between discrimination and smoking in South Africa. Methods This analysis examined chronic (day-to-day) and acute (lifetime) experiences of racial and non-racial (eg, age, gender or physical appearance) discrimination and smoking status among respondents to the South Africa Stress and Health study. Logistic regression models were constructed using SAS-Callable SUDAAN. Results Both chronic racial discrimination (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.85) and chronic non-racial discrimination (RR=1.69, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.08) predicted a higher risk of smoking, but neither type of acute discrimination did. Total (sum of racial and non-racial) chronic discrimination (RR=1.46, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.78) and total acute discrimination (RR=1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60) predicted a higher risk of current smoking. Conclusions Racial and non-racial discrimination may be related to South African adults’ smoking behaviour, but this relationship likely varies by the timing and frequency of these experiences.

1190,Christine De Pizan's Vision for the Exemplary Parenting of Mother Marina*,"""For as low as human nature fell through this creature woman, was human nature lifted higher by this same creature.""1The work of the writer Christine de Pizan continues to generate scholarly attention across disciplinary boundaries for its insights into the social, historical and political thought worlds of late fourteenth- and early fifteenthcentury France. In particular, Christine's assertive positions in the ongoing debates about the role of women in her day remain a relevant site for interpretation. For many scholars, Christine and her work represent a pivotal moment in the development of women's history.2 Christine had a prolific pen; her literary impact alone spans a wide array of genres through which she explores both standard and non-traditional renderings of common rhetorical devices and content.3 In the opening sections of The Book of the City of Ladies, written in 1405, Christine deftly describes the appearance of three virtues (Lady Reason, Lady Rectitude and Lady Justice) who instruct her to build an allegorical city founded upon the examples of women predecessors. The structural foundations for this new City of Ladies will serve as a tribute to those women who developed and exercised their human capacities, a memorial to those women who followed God's will on earth, and a celebration of those women who were saints and martyrs for God. Fortified by a rewritten tradition of women's roles and contributions, the City of Ladies will embody a community that draws on the strength of women's experience as a form of historical truth (Kellogg 129-46).Among those to be included in the City of Ladies is the transvestite nun, St. Marina (Constas). The legend of St. Marina, like other legends of transvestite nuns, circulated widely in the late middle ages. Despite particular differences, these legends share the theme of gender disguise; they recount the assumption of male gender by women.5 In the legend of St. Marina, gender disguise allows a father and his daughter to live together in a male monastery; the suspense of the legend builds through the events that occur following the death of the father and the final discovery of the revealed sex of his daughter, known to the monks as ""Brother Marinos.""Christine features St. Marina among those virgin martyrs who remained faithful in the midst of persecution and ridicule. In at least one noticeable way, Christine's appeal to St. Marina appears distinct from most of the other women included in The Book of the City of Ladies.6 The work applauds women scientists, politicians, military leaders, and poets; it addresses women who serve selflessly and with assurance; it upholds staunch defenders of the Christian faith as well as women who lead their families and communities by their example. In all cases, the female identities of Christine's exempla are outwardly visible and so are known as certain to the reader. As a mark of difference from all of these accounts, the legend of St. Marina disguises its figure's female identity in earnest; visible only as a male monk to all around her but her father with whom she dwells in the monastic cell, St. Marina's identity remains veiled to those around her until the concluding events of the legend.Christine's appeal to St. Marina, a figure whose female identity was decidedly and determinedly suppressed, in The Book of the City of Ladies, a work which recognizes that same identity as an exemplar of Christian piety and humility, is an intentional rhetorical strategy. St. Marina makes her appearance in the third and final part of the work/ Christine tells us that she includes the legend of St. Marina in order to give attention to the category of the virgin martyr ""whose legends are quite beautiful and at the same time support the contention that women are constant"" (de Pizan, 241; BCL III.12.1). In this way, Christine frames the intended emphasis in her employment of the saint: her use of the legend is not related to an exploration or examination of gender or of gender identity primarily but, rather, of this category of pious Christian women, particularly; that is to say, it is what St. …",,2014,0,0,0,False,,1199,2402921,Patrick Ferrucci,9651101,Heather Shoenberger,115218588,Erin E.

1191,Ten Simple Rules to Achieve Conference Speaker Gender Balance,"Recently, the quantum molecular science world was in uproar [1], [2]. The preliminary list of approximately 25 speakers for the International Congress of Quantum Chemistry (ICQC) was published online, with no women speakers listed. One reaction to this list was to set up a petition to “condemn gender-biased discriminatory practices of which ICQC-2015 is the most recent example” [3]. This resulted in an apology and a new speaker list with six women speakers [4]. 
 
Sadly though, this is not an isolated incident: men-only invited conference speaker lists are all too common [5]. 
 
How can we get gender balance right? To begin with, it's worth reminding ourselves why gender balance is important. 
 
First, it's critical for the future of science that young women and men can see real evidence that scientists can succeed regardless of gender. So, if we are going to encourage women into careers in science we need also to provide role models for them to aspire to. We need to show that being a woman and being a successful scientist are not mutually exclusive. One way of doing that is to give women scientists a platform to present their research. If we don't address gender balance in speaker programs, we will continue to normalise a gendered stereotype of scientific leadership. Then when crunch time comes, women will continue to leave in far greater numbers than men [6]–[9] in part because they see no path ahead for themselves. And that means scientific research potentially loses half of its brightest talent. 
 
Moreover, a speaking invitation contributes enormously to the profile of a researcher. By extending more invitations to women and other under-represented sections of the academic community, we provide a boost to their visibility and their track record. This will help them to progress by raising their national and international profile and help support their applications for grants, academic positions, and fellowships. 
 
Finally, conferences and symposia are great ways of generating new collaborations, new ideas, and new directions in science. If we keep inviting the same people, and the same types of people, over and over again, we limit the diversity of thought and, potentially, the opportunities for innovation. 
 
So, here are ten simple rules to achieve conference speaker gender balance.",PLoS Comput. Biol.,2014,22,116,2,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Ten simple rules to achieve conference speaker gender balance: give women scientists a platform to present their research and limit the diversity of thought and the opportunities for innovation.'}",1200,4250576,Stefanie K Johnson,4654099,Traci Sitzmann,50231819,A.

1192,Effects of playing a violent video game as male versus female avatar on subsequent aggression in male and female players.,"Previous research has shown that violent video games can increase aggression in players immediately after they play. The present research examines the effects of one subtle cue within violent video games that might moderate these effects-whether the avatar is male or female. One common stereotype is that males are more aggressive than females. Thus, playing a violent video game as a male avatar, compared to a female avatar, should be more likely to prime aggressive thoughts and inclinations in players and lead to more aggressive behavior afterwards. Male and female university students (N = 242) were randomly assigned to play a violent video game as a male or female avatar. After gameplay, participants gave an ostensible partner who hated spicy food hot sauce to eat. The amount of hot sauce given was used to measure aggression. Consistent with priming theory, results showed that both male and female participants who played a violent game as a male avatar behaved more aggressively afterwards than those who played as female avatar. The priming effects of the male avatar were somewhat stronger for male participants than for female participants, suggesting that male participants identified more with the male avatar than did the female participants. These results are particularly noteworthy because they are consistent with another recent experiment showing that playing a violent game as an avatar with a different stereotypically aggressive attribute (black skin color) stimulates more aggression than playing as an avatar without the stereotypically aggressive attribute (Yang et al., 2014, Social Psychological and Personality Science).",Aggressive Behavior,2014,41,34,2,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results showed that both male and female participants who played a violent game as a male avatar behaved more aggressively afterwards than those who played as female avatar, suggesting that male participants identified more with the male avatar than did the female participants.'}",1201,2061487409,Amy Goldberg,41217702,P.

1193,Face the consequences: learning about victim's suffering reduces sexual harassment myth acceptance and men's likelihood to sexually harass.,"Prior research has shown that (1) better knowledge about the consequences of rape goes along with less rape-supportive attitudes and lower rape proclivity, and (2) empathy with the victims correlates negatively with sexual aggression. In two experiments, the authors combined these approaches in order to reduce sexual harassment myth acceptance (SHMA) and the likelihood to sexually harass (LSH). In Study 1, 101 male and female university students read a report describing sexual harassment as either serious or harmless, and completed scales assessing dispositional empathy and SHMA. Results showed that higher empathy was associated with lower SHMA; furthermore, learning about the seriousness (vs. harmlessness) of sexual harassment led to lower SHMA, particularly in participants low in empathy. Gender differences in SHMA were fully explained by gender differences in empathy. In Study 2, perspective taking, a crucial aspect of empathy, was manipulated. One hundred nineteen male and female participants read either a neutral text or a description of a sexual harassment case, which was written either from the female target's or from the male perpetrator's perspective; then they completed scales measuring SHMA and (only male participants) LSH. The target's perspective led to lower SHMA and to lower LSH than did the neutral text, whereas no such effect was found for the perpetrator's perspective.

1194,Price's Progress: Sex Stereotyping and Its Potential for Antidiscrimination Law,"American antidiscrimination law has addressed harmful stereotypes since, at least, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Stereotypes about the different abilities of men and women, or of black and white workers, lay underneath much of the segregation and workplace inequality that Title VII sought to correct. However, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins has radically expanded our conception of stereotypes as discrimination, and in doing so has introduced revolutionary ideas to the workplace and the courts. Prior to Price Waterhouse, Title VII had been thought to apply only to ascriptive stereotyping — to monolithic misconceptions burdening all members of a disfavored group. Price Waterhouse’s extension of Title VII protection to victims of prescriptive stereotype has constituted a massive, and heretofore unstudied, conceptual leap. This Note examines how Price Waterhouse’s prohibition against stereotyping can transform American workplace law and analyzes one area where it already has — antigay discrimination. By contrasting the requirements for proving antigay discrimination under a Price Waterhouse sex stereotyping theory with the traditional Title VII methods many states use to protect LGBT workers, I show both how Price Waterhouse can complement proposed LGBT-specific protections such as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), and how its normative vision is a vital addition to existing antidiscrimination law.",,2014,0,6,1,False,,1203,1403853002,Barry Pennock-Speck,1404793041,Miguel Fuster-Márquez,,,,,,,,,Psychology,JournalArticle

The intersection of racism and sexism doubly victimizes the African-American women especially the slaves as they try to break out of this two-fold oppression. While racism decreed Black women would be enslaved, it was sexism that determined the lot of women harsher. Nanny living in the slavery era was oppressed as a worker on her white master’s plantation, raped victim and then as a mammy working for a white family.

Drawing on theories of gender roles, we proposed that gender is an important factor that influences whether avoidant conflict management mitigates the negative affective effects of relationship conflict. In a field study of a healthcare organization, we found that relationship conflict resulted in negative emotions, which, in turn, were positively associated with emotional exhaustion two months later. Avoidant conflict management attenuated the relationship between negative emotions engendered by relationship conflict and emotional exhaustion, but this effect depended on gender. Among men, the extent to which they used an avoidant conflict management style mitigated the association between negative emotions and emotional exhaustion, whereas among women, avoidant conflict management did not attenuate this relationship.

This article synthesizes evidence regarding the status of female physicians in three purposively selected regions outside the United States: Japan, Scandinavia, and Russia and Eastern Europe. These three regions markedly differ in the proportion of female physicians in the workforce, overall status of the medical profession, cultural views of gender roles, and workforce policies. Through a review of studies and articles published between 1992 and 2012 examining women's representation, status measures such as salary and leadership positions, and experiences of female physicians, the authors discuss potential relationships between the representation of female physicians, their status in medicine, and the overall status of the profession. The findings suggest that even when women constitute a high proportion of the physician workforce, they may continue to be underrepresented in positions of leadership and prestige. Evolving workforce policies, environments, and cultural views of gender roles appear to play a critical role in mediating the relationship between women's participation in the medical profession and their ability to rise to positions of influence within it.

1201,Autosomal Admixture Levels Are Informative About Sex Bias in Admixed Populations,"Sex-biased admixture has been observed in a wide variety of admixed populations. Genetic variation in sex chromosomes and functions of quantities computed from sex chromosomes and autosomes have often been examined to infer patterns of sex-biased admixture, typically using statistical approaches that do not mechanistically model the complexity of a sex-specific history of admixture. Here, expanding on a model of Verdu and Rosenberg (2011) that did not include sex specificity, we develop a model that mechanistically examines sex-specific admixture histories. Under the model, multiple source populations contribute to an admixed population, potentially with their male and female contributions varying over time. In an admixed population descended from two source groups, we derive the moments of the distribution of the autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population as a function of sex-specific introgression parameters and time. Considering admixture processes that are constant in time, we demonstrate that surprisingly, although the mean autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population does not reveal a sex bias in the admixture history, the variance of autosomal admixture is informative about sex bias. Specifically, the long-term variance decreases as the sex bias from a contributing source population increases. This result can be viewed as analogous to the reduction in effective population size for populations with an unequal number of breeding males and females. Our approach suggests that it may be possible to use the effect of sex-biased admixture on autosomal DNA to assist with methods for inference of the history of complex sex-biased admixture processes.",Genetics,2014,71,28,1,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This work develops a model that mechanistically examines sex-specific admixture histories and demonstrates that surprisingly, although the mean autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population does not reveal a sex bias in the admixture history, the variance of autosome admixture is informative about sex bias.'}",1210,7222762,Elizabeth A.

To this end we have carried out an empirical analysis of imperatives in voice-overs in the MATVA corpus (Multimodal Analysis of TV Ads) which contains transcriptions of nearly 800 voice-overs in British TV ads recorded on six days during 2009, 2010 and 2011. We provide an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative profile of imperatives in contemporary TV advertising. This includes information on the distribution of imperatives, the most common verbs in imperative clauses, and their discourse function.

1205,"Infertility around the globe: new thinking on gender, reproductive technologies and global movements in the 21st century.","BACKGROUND
Infertility is estimated to affect as many as 186 million people worldwide. Although male infertility contributes to more than half of all cases of global childlessness, infertility remains a woman's social burden. Unfortunately, areas of the world with the highest rates of infertility are often those with poor access to assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs). In such settings, women may be abandoned to their childless destinies. However, emerging data suggest that making ART accessible and affordable is an important gender intervention. To that end, this article presents an overview of what we know about global infertility, ART and changing gender relations, posing five key questions: (i) why is infertility an ongoing global reproductive health problem? (ii) What are the gender effects of infertility, and are they changing over time? (iii) What do we know about the globalization of ART to resource-poor settings? (iv) How are new global initiatives attempting to improve access to IVF? (v) Finally, what can be done to overcome infertility, help the infertile and enhance low-cost IVF (LCIVF) activism?


METHODS
An exhaustive literature review using MEDLINE, Google Scholar and the keyword search function provided through the Yale University Library (i.e. which scans multiple databases simultaneously) identified 103 peer-reviewed journal articles and 37 monographs, chapters and reports from the years 2000-2014 in the areas of: (i) infertility demography, (ii) ART in low-resource settings, (iii) gender and infertility in low-resource settings and (iv) the rise of LCIVF initiatives. International Federation of Fertility Societies Surveillance reports were particularly helpful in identifying important global trends in IVF clinic distribution between 2002 and 2010. Additionally, a series of articles published by scholars who are tracking global cross-border reproductive care (CBRC) trends, as well as others who are involved in the growing LCIVF movement, were invaluable.


RESULTS
Recent global demographic surveys indicate that infertility remains an ongoing reproductive problem, with six key demographic features. Despite the massive global expansion of ART services over the past decade (2005-2015), ART remains inaccessible in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where IVF clinics are still absent in most countries. For women living in such ART-poor settings, the gender effects of infertility may be devastating. In contrast, in ART-rich regions such as the Middle East, the negative gender effects of infertility are diminishing over time, especially with state subsidization of ART. Furthermore, men are increasingly acknowledging their male infertility and seeking ICSI. Thus, access to ART may ameliorate gender discrimination, especially in the Global South. To that end, a number of clinician-led, LCIVF initiatives are in development to provide affordable ART, particularly in Africa. Without access to LCIVF, many infertile couples must incur catastrophic expenditures to fund their IVF, or engage in CBRC to seek lower-cost IVF elsewhere.


CONCLUSIONS
Given the present realities, three future directions for research and intervention are suggested: (i) address the preventable causes of infertility, (ii) provide support and alternatives for the infertile and (iii) encourage new LCIVF initiatives to improve availability, affordability and acceptability of ART around the globe.",Human Reproduction Update,2015,162,987,29,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An overview of what is known about global infertility, ART and changing gender relations is presented, posing five key questions: why is infertility an ongoing global reproductive health problem, what are the gender effects of infertility, and are they changing over time?'}",1214,5164155,M.

1208,Gender on the Brain: A Case Study of Science Communication in the New Media Environment,"Neuroscience research on sex difference is currently a controversial field, frequently accused of purveying a ‘neurosexism’ that functions to naturalise gender inequalities. However, there has been little empirical investigation of how information about neurobiological sex difference is interpreted within wider society. This paper presents a case study that tracks the journey of one high-profile study of neurobiological sex differences from its scientific publication through various layers of the public domain. A content analysis was performed to ascertain how the study was represented in five domains of communication: the original scientific article, a press release, the traditional news media, online reader comments and blog entries. Analysis suggested that scientific research on sex difference offers an opportunity to rehearse abiding cultural understandings of gender. In both scientific and popular contexts, traditional gender stereotypes were projected onto the novel scientific information, which was harnessed to demonstrate the factual truth and normative legitimacy of these beliefs. Though strains of misogyny were evident within the readers’ comments, most discussion of the study took pains to portray the sexes’ unique abilities as equal and ‘complementary’. However, this content often resembled a form of benevolent sexism, in which praise of women’s social-emotional skills compensated for their relegation from more esteemed trait-domains, such as rationality and productivity. The paper suggests that embedding these stereotype patterns in neuroscience may intensify their rhetorical potency by lending them the epistemic authority of science. It argues that the neuroscience of sex difference does not merely reflect, but can actively shape the gender norms of contemporary society.",PLoS ONE,2014,116,63,3,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A case study tracks the journey of one high-profile study of neurobiological sex differences from its scientific publication through various layers of the public domain and suggests that embedding stereotype patterns in neuroscience may intensify their rhetorical potency by lending them the epistemic authority of science.'}",1217,72029412,Maryeve Heath,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

Instead, many fall into the trap of making ethnocentric assumptions and coming to conclusions that are informed by their own cultural perspectives. This in-class active learning exercise makes the familiar strange, using Horace Miner’s well-known 1956 essay “Body Ritual among the Nacirema” to introduce students to an etic, cultural outsider–like description of American culture. Using short excerpts from Miner’s article, students draw pictures of Miner’s descriptions, producing a wide variety of interpretations. This activity demonstrates that when students overlook or misunderstand cultural meaning, they can come to myriad inaccurate depictions and conclusions about social life and behavior. It therefore reinforces the importance of developing an emic understanding of cultures, rather than accepting social phenomena at face value.",,2014,18,3,0,False,,1219,12227686,Shelby B.

Recent controversies the Turkish context show that Islamophobia should not solely be regarded as a phenomenon, which originated and still operates mainly in the West. Rather, the case of Turkey encourages one to critically negotiate the boundaries of visual culture, which is invested with particular strategies of power that reproduce the images of Islamic lifestyle as undesirable signifiers of culture.",,2014,63,11,0,False,,1220,36720498,Gayle A.

It is a comprehensive study of all the female personalities mentioned in the Qur’an, and is selective in the personalities of the sunna to the three prominent women of ahl al-bayt, Khadi>ja, Fa>t}ima, and Zaynab. The sources examined here are the major sources of Ima>mi> Shi>‘i> Islam, including the exegetical compilations of the eminent Shi>‘i> religious authorities of the classical and modern periods; as well as the authoritative books of Shi>’i> traditions. The results reached here are that female personalities are portrayed as human beings, and that they display feminine qualities, which are often viewed positively and are sometimes commendable traits for men, at least as far as the spiritual domain is concerned. The hypothesis, particularly about women’s humanity, will be tested against the depiction of womanhood in the h}adi>th literature, with special emphasis on Nahj al-Bala>gha.

1228,The Invisible Second Generation? Statistical Discrimination and Immigrant Stereotypes in Employment Processes in Norway,"Although children of immigrants usually have acquired fluency in the majority language as well as domestic educational qualifications and work experience, recent quantitative and experimental studies indicate that the ‘second generation’ experiences discrimination in accessing entry-level jobs in Europe. In this article, I take as my point of departure a field experiment documenting that descendants of Pakistani immigrants indeed face discrimination in the Norwegian labour market, and use data from in-depth interviews with 42 of the employers subjected to research in the experiment to explore the decision-making processes leading to the disadvantages observed. The qualitative material suggests that stereotypes associated with immigrants are inferred from ethnically distinct names by employers, and that negative experiences are generalised between ethnic groups and across generations. The implications for the employment opportunities of children of immigrants are potentially severe. Instead of experiencing equal access to the labour market, they encounter attitudes and stereotypes attached to their parents' generation, making their domestic educational qualifications and linguistic fluency ‘invisible’ in the eyes of employers.",,2014,71,76,4,False,,1237,2143515925,Yue Huang,152952207,S.

1232,Postfeminist masculinity and the complex politics of time: contemporary quality television imagines a pre-feminist world,"Television's Life on Mars (BBC 2006–2007), The Sopranos (HBO 1999–2007), Mad Men (AMC 2007–), and Bored to Death (HBO 2009–11) exemplify a recent and ongoing trend in representations of masculinity and contemporary gender politics. Heralded as sophisticated and progressive in both aesthetic and ideological terms, these programs refute obvious sexism, yet bear complex investments in restoring a past state to men. This paper explores the ways in which time travel to the past or nostalgic overlay of the present signifies ‘quality television’ while simultaneously expressing attitudes about a postfeminist world, where the gains of feminist politics are meant to be firmly established, understood as necessary, and respected. In these television representations, sensitized men are suffering and victimized. They, therefore, are justified in retreating, through spatial and temporal means, to alternatives to the existing social order. In investigating these configurations of masculinity and time, this paper identifies the terms by which contemporary television expresses, yet masks discontent with feminist gains.",,2014,24,12,2,False,,1241,144433516,G.

1233,Introduction: (Re)integrating Feminist Security Studies and Global Political Economy: Continuing the Conversation through Empirical Perspectives,"Attempts to integrate feminist security studies (FSS) and feminist global political economy (GPE) were first meticulously studied in the Critical Perspectives sections of the June 2015 and December 2017 issues of this journal. Although the debate has gained presence in workshops, at international conferences, and even on dedicated websites, the diverse contributions have remained rather theoretical (e.g., Bergeron, Cohn, and Duncanson 2017; Hudson 2015). The aim of these Critical Perspectives essays is to take the integration of FSS and GPE one step further by presenting empirically grounded contributions that help us contextualize the existing theoretical debates. By focusing on postwar contexts, the pieces here take seriously the material conditions of women's empowerment from a perspective attuned to the gendered and racialized logics structuring social orders in postwar states. We believe that these are the spaces where war economies and peace economies meet and where (gendered) structural transformation of societies is possible. Like the two previous collections, we do not understand FSS and GPE as additive (Chisholm and Stachowitsch 2017). Rather, we understand them as traditions that share a common goal, namely, to undermine the racialized neoliberalism and patriarchal capitalism underpinning international intervention and postwar reconstruction projects.",Politics & Gender,2020,17,2,0,True,,1242,2863209,P.

1234,Positive and negative sexual cognitions: similarities and differences between men and women from southern Spain,"The aim of this study was to explore the frequency of sexual cognitions in Spanish men and women, distinguishing between positive sexual cognitions (PSC) and negative sexual cognitions (NSC), and various subtypes of such cognitions based on their content (intimate, exploratory, dominance, submission, and impersonal). We also examined the relationship between both age and education level and Christian religion/religiosity and the frequency of all subtypes of sexual cognitions. The sample was composed of 1332 participants aged between 18 and 45 years. Results showed that the most and least frequent sexual cognitions were intimate and sadomasochistic cognitions, respectively. Overall, men reported a higher frequency of PSC than did women, except for cognitions involving submission. In addition, undergraduate students reported a higher frequency of dominant PSC than older individuals. Regarding NSC, men reported a higher frequency of dominance themes, while women reported more frequent cognitions involving submission. In addition, intimate, exploratory, and impersonal NSC were more frequently reported in the younger sample. Religion was associated with the frequency of most PSC but not with NSC. We discuss the implications of assessing both the affect and content of sexual cognitions for their training in sex therapy.",,2014,63,11,0,False,,1243,67053811,A. G.

Instead of blaming individual victims of rape and assault, the masculinization of victimhood shifts culpability to the Peace Corps.

1238,HUMAN RIGHTS VS. ROBOT RIGHTS: Forecasts from Japan,"ABSTRACT: Japan continues to be in the vanguard of human–robot communication and, since 2007, the state has actively promoted the virtues of a robot-dependent society and lifestyle. Nationwide surveys suggest that Japanese citizens are more comfortable sharing living and working environments with robots than with foreign caretakers and migrant workers. As their population continues to shrink and age faster than in other postindustrial nation-states, Japanese are banking on the robotics industry to reinvigorate the economy and to preserve the country's alleged ethnic homogeneity. These initiatives are paralleled by a growing support among some roboticists and politicians to confer citizenship on robots. The Japanese state has a problematic record on human rights, especially toward ethnic minorities and non-Japanese residents who have lived and worked in Japan for many generations. The possibility of robots acquiring civil status ahead of flesh-and-blood humans raises profound questions about the nature of citizenship and human rights. Already the idea of robots having evolved beyond consideration as “property” and acquiring legal status as sentient beings with “rights” is shaping developments in artificial intelligence and robotics outside of Japan, including in the United States. What does the pursuit in Japan of interdependence between humans and robots forecast about new approaches to and configurations of civil society and attendant rights there and in other technologically advanced postindustrial societies?",,2014,60,33,1,False,,1247,1926391,Bradford Demarest,51182865,Guo Freeman,34836211,C.

Many studies from fields of sociology of science and science policy studies have been conducted to identify biases and predict outcomes of these processes, mainly focusing on characteristics of applicants, applications, and reviewers. However, as panel reviewing entails social interaction, group dynamics influence these processes. By adding insights from social psychology to current knowledge on panel reviews, we are better able to identify factors affecting talent selection and funding decisions in grant panels. By opening up this so-called black box, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of panel decision making. This knowledge is also relevant for various stakeholders involved in grant allocation, for applicants, reviewers, and policymakers, as it can be used to improve transparency, fairness, and legitimation of talent selection processes.",,2014,91,50,2,True,,1251,114732673,L.

1250,A biocultural study of the effects of maternal stress on mother and newborn health in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"The impact of stress on human health is a topic of wide-spread relevance and one that is particularly amenable to multidisciplinary investigation. Stress impacts both our psychological and physical health and, thus, may leave evidence on our psyche, our physical body and our genome. We are interested in the effect of extreme stressors, such as war, on health from the perspective of long-term and multigenerational effects. We integrate sociocultural, biological, and epigenetic data from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Between May and August, 2010, we measured sociocultural stress exposure among 25 mother-newborn dyads and we measured health outcomes in newborns. We also collected maternal venous blood, placental tissue, and umbilical cord blood to assay for methylation changes to test for a possible epigenetic mechanism that mediates the effects of stress on health. We provide a qualitative description of the wide range of stress exposures experienced by mothers in our study. As we have shown previously, maternal war stress is strongly associated with newborn birthweight and changes in newborn methylation at the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1. New results presented here demonstrate that maternal war stress and birthweight are also associated with genome-wide changes in maternal methylation levels. In sum, these results suggest that stress may influence gene expression across a broad spectrum in the individual who directly experiences the stress, i.e., the mother, whereas potential heritable effects in the newborn may be focused on specific genes that are uniquely sensitive to environmental cues.",American Journal of Physical Anthropology,2014,70,54,2,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results suggest that stress may influence gene expression across a broad spectrum in the individual who directly experiences the stress, i.e., the mother, whereas potential heritable effects in the newborn may be focused on specific genes that are uniquely sensitive to environmental cues.'}",1259,1892904,N.

Study findings included: (a) most gay men have a nontraditional career pathway to the presidency; (b) while gay men are resilient in overcoming the dominant heteronormative culture impacts, dominant culture beliefs continue to play a significant role in the search process; (c) gay men believe that being out during the search process speaks to their integrity and character; and (d) gay men strategically utilize two communication approaches when communicating with the dominant culture in an effort to assess if the heteronormative environment will be affirming.",,2014,123,6,2,True,,1261,100897506,Elisabeth K.

1255,"The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations","Using PSID microdata over the 1980-2010, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably over this period. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution that at the middle or the bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women’s work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than say occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2016,301,1773,158,True,,1264,114216809,Joanna Jamel,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,Review

In each cycle, proposals with male PIs have a higher success rate, with the disparity greatest for Cycles 12 and 18. The offsets are small enough that they might be ascribed to chance for any single cycle, but the consistent pattern suggests the presence of a systematic effect. Closer inspection of results from Cycles 19, 20, and 21 shows that the systematic difference does not appear to depend on the geographic origin of the proposal nor does it depend on the gender distribution on the review panels. Segregating proposals by the seniority of the PI, the success rates by gender for more recent graduates (Ph.D. since 2000) are more closely comparable. There is also a correlation between success by gender and the average seniority of the review panel for Cycles 19 and 20, but not Cycle 21.

1260,When extraordinary injustice leads to ordinary response: How perpetrator power and size of an injustice event affect bystander efficacy and collective action,"Although bystanders can play an integral role in the process of social change, relatively few studies have examined the factors that influence bystander collective action. The present research explores the effect of perpetrator power on bystander efficacy and collective action, as well as the moderating role of impact of the injustice event. Across two experiments, bystanders perceived that collective action would be less effective and were less willing to engage in collective action when a highpower perpetrator engaged in injustice, compared with a low-power perpetrator. These effects were moderated by impact of the injustice event, such that the effects of power were especially present under conditions of large impact (many victims), compared with small impact (fewer victims). Whereas the effect of the interaction of perpetrator power and impact on bystander efficacy was explained by perceptions of normativity of the injustice event, the effect of the interaction on bystander collective action was explained by bystander efficacy. Implications for bystander collective action and social change are discussed. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,2014,77,11,0,False,,1269,5696809,J. Spoor,4241972,J.

Second, individual strategies for overcoming being in a minority are suggested that indicate that the individual rather than societal structures shape chances of success. Finally, generational change is used to argue that gender inequality belongs to a previous generation, which indicates that inequality is becoming unspeakable.

Many cross-sectional surveys have demonstrated that distal and proximal measures of men’s alcohol consumption are positively associated with sexual assault perpetration, although very few of these studies evaluated how alcohol interacts with other risk and protective factors to exacerbate or inhibit sexual aggression. There are surprisingly few surveys that examine alcohol’s effects at the event level and over short-time intervals to identify how changes in alcohol consumption are associated with changes in perpetration status.

1266,The Constant Gardener? Two books on women’s sexual fantasies,"Over the years, I've regularly reviewed books for the Journal, but I've never made individual books the focus of a Consumer Correspondent article. I’m about to break the mould by writing about two books: one written recently, the other during the so-called ‘sexual revolution’.

The more recent book is Garden of Desires by Emily Dubberley, published in 2013. The older book is My Secret Garden by Nancy Friday, first published in 1973, then reissued for its 40th anniversary. Both books not only explore the subject of women’s sexual fantasies, but have as their foundation personal stories from over 400 contemporary women. Together – and my motivation for making both of them the subject of this article – is that the books form a diptych illustrating women’s sexuality then and now.

Nancy Friday’s book was pivotal in that it took sexual fantasy from deniability into social acceptance. Her prologue is a personal account of the challenges of writing the book in the face of society’s repudiation, men’s disapproval and individual women’s guilt. Friday’s first foray into the exploration of women’s fantasies was to include them in a chapter in a novel she was writing; her publisher’s abhorrence at the idea and his assumption that any woman who fantasised was a ‘sexual freak’ persuaded her to stop writing and consign the novel to a bottom drawer.

It took several further years for her to begin talking openly to others about fantasy, collecting first her friends’ disclosures and then placing advertisements in the press to gather more first-person accounts. The huge number of such accounts, together with their authors’ admissions of relief and gratitude for being able to confide in someone, convinced her of the value of the project, showing her that a book revealing the contents of the female ‘secret garden’ might …",Journal of family planning and reproductive health care,2014,0,0,0,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Two books: one written recently, the other during the so-called ‘sexual revolution’, which form a diptych illustrating women’s sexuality then and now.'}",1275,6933215,Kristie L.

School-based sexual education programs, in particular, may be well positioned to address social factors that are empirically linked to negative sexual health outcomes, such as traditional social norms surrounding gender and sexuality. However, youth are seldom granted access to sexual education programs that explicitly address these issues. This study presents findings from a pretest–posttest survey of a sexual education program that did. It was designed for eighth graders (N=95) in the context of a school–community collaboration.

Findings link participation in the sexual education program to more progressive attitudes toward girls and women, less agreement with hegemonic masculinity ideology, and increases in sexual health and resource knowledge.

1270,Factors That Determine the Adoption Intention of Direct Mobile Purchases through Social Media Apps,"In the last few years, a number of social media e-business models including the social networking giants of Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram have offered direct purchase abilities to both their users and the involved enterprises. Hence, individuals can buy directly without having to leave the social media website. At the same time, there is a significant increase in the number of online purchases through mobile devices. To add to this, nowadays, the vast majority of internet users prefer to surf via their smartphone rather than a desktop PC. The aforementioned facts reveal the abilities and potential dynamics of Mobile Social Commerce (MSC), which is considered not only the present but also the future of e-commerce, as well as an area of prosperous academic and managerial concern. In spite of its several extant abilities and its booming future, MSC has been little examined until now. Therefore, this study aims to determine the factors that impact smartphone users’ behavioral intention to adopt direct purchases through social media apps in a country where these kinds of m-services are not yet available. In specific, it extends the well-established Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model with the main ICT facilitators (i.e., convenience, reward and security) and inhibitors (i.e., risk and anxiety).

Convenience sampling was applied to gather the data and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was then performed to investigate the research hypotheses of the proposed conceptual model.

Methods The cervical cancer mortality rates of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) were used to model and analyze the dynamics of cervical cancer mortality. A longitudinal hyperbolastic mixed-effects type II model was used to model the cervical cancer mortality data and SAS PROC NLMIXED and Mathematica were utilized to perform the computations. Results Despite decreasing trends in cervical cancer mortality rates for both races, racial disparities in mortality rates still exist. In all 13 states, Black women had higher mortality rates at all times. The degree of disparities and pace of decline in mortality rates over time differed among these states. Determining the paces of decline over 36 years showed that Tennessee had the most rapid decline in cervical cancer mortality for Black women, and Mississippi had the most rapid decline for White Women. In contrast, slow declines in cervical cancer mortality were noted for Black women in Florida and for White women in Maryland. Conclusions In all 13 states, cervical cancer mortality rates for both racial groups have fallen. Disparities in the pace of decline in mortality rates in these states may be due to differences in the rates of screening for cervical cancers.

Surprisingly there has been little attempt to document systematically either the extent or the shape of these changes in the way universities work, or to consider what kinds of impact they might be having on staff, students or knowledge—one of the things universities supposedly exist for.1 The context in which professional legal ethics operate is a crucial factor in evaluating the choices confronting lawyers and the pressures that may influence how these ethical dilemmas are resolved.2",,2014,66,16,1,True,,1290,3483115,Y.

1286,"Book review: Race, Gender and the Activism of Black Feminist Theory: Working with Audre Lorde","Beginning from the premise that all ideologies and movements for radical social change including critical psychology needs to be questioned, dismantled, and new perspectives brought to the table in order to produce alternative solutions, this book takes an unusual trans-disciplinary step into the activism of Black feminist theory. The author, Suriya Nayak, presents a close reading of Audre Lorde and other related Black feminist scholars to demonstrate how the activism of Black feminist theory is concerned with issues that are central to radical critical thinking and practice, such as identity, alienation, trauma, loss, the position and constitution of individuals within relationships, the family, community and society. 
 
Nayak reveals how the activism of Black feminist theory seeks to address issues which are also a core concern of critical thinking and practice such as critical psychology, including individualism, essentialism and normalization. Her work grapples with several issues at the heart of key contemporary debates concerning methodology, identity, difference, race, gender, social change, and the psychological impact of social constructions. Using a powerful line of argument, the book weaves these themes together to show how the activism of Black feminist theory in general and the work of Audre Lorde in particular can be applied to the subject and practice of creating social change in the face of the psychological impact of oppressive social constructions. 
 
Race, Gender, and the Activism of Black Feminist Theory will be of great interest to advanced students, researchers, political activist and practitioners in psychology, counselling, psychotherapy, mental health, social work and community development.",Psych-Talk,2014,0,21,2,False,,1295,79580559,Wendelien Vantieghem,37100310,Hans Vermeersch,3267687,M.

The description of these strategies is grounded here on arguments from the scientific output of environmental psychology; this allows us to reflect on gender blindness and biases in the discipline. The presence of these symptoms is evidenced by the exclusion of sex and gender as analytical categories in a recent review of the empirical research of the field and also in a commemorative bibliometric analysis of papers published during the period 1981–2011. This double exclusion is contrasted with the feminist perspective in the field of study of people-environment relationships in the broad sense. Beyond the underlying epistemological differences between distinct perspectives on disciplinary approach, the goal of equality in the analysis of urban design, planning for everyday life and mobility of care or in the study of pro-environmental concern and behaviour, disaster vulnerability and cooperation towards sustainable development is envisioned.",,2014,38,2,0,False,,1296,38019558,Sarah M.

1298,Do You See What I See? Perceptions of Gender Microaggressions in the Workplace,"Although blatant expressions of sexism in the American workforce appear on the decline, many researchers note that discrimination is not disappearing but is instead becoming more subtle and ambiguous. Drawing from Sue et al.’s construct of microaggressions, which examines manifestations of prejudice ranging from subtle to overt, the present research provides the first known empirical investigation of gender differences in third-party perceptions of microaggressions against women at work. Undergraduate women and men read vignettes describing interactions between male supervisors and female subordinates, which portrayed potentially discriminatory supervisor behavior, ranging in explicitness from subtle to blatant. Results indicate that although both men and women perceive differences in microaggression explicitness, women tend to detect greater discrimination than men, particularly when instances are subtle in nature. Both genders expect microaggressions to generate more negative work outcomes as explicitness increases. We discuss practical implications of our research, including the importance of raising awareness of workplace gender microaggressions, especially its most subtle forms, and of developing supporting programs to help observers of discrimination, who may be more likely to be women in cases of perceived microaggressions against women. Future research directions for addressing the broad range of discrimination facing working women today are also explored.",,2014,44,134,6,False,,1307,38733896,H. Jacobson,1790161,H.

1300,A Web-Based Sexual Violence Bystander Intervention for Male College Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Bystander intervention approaches offer promise for reducing rates of sexual violence on college campuses. Most interventions are in-person small-group formats, which limit their reach and reduce their overall public health impact. Objective This study evaluated the efficacy of RealConsent, a Web-based bystander approach to sexual violence prevention, in enhancing prosocial intervening behaviors and preventing sexual violence perpetration. Methods A random probability sample of 743 male undergraduate students (aged 18 to 24 years) attending a large, urban university located in the southeastern United States was recruited online and randomized to either RealConsent (n=376) or a Web-based general health promotion program (n=367). Participants were surveyed online at baseline, postintervention, and 6-months postintervention. RealConsent was delivered via a password-protected Web portal that contained six 30-minute media-based and interactive modules covering knowledge of informed consent, communication skills regarding sex, the role of alcohol and male socialization in sexual violence, empathy for rape victims, and bystander education. Primary outcomes were self-reported prosocial intervening behaviors and sexual violence perpetration. Secondary outcomes were theoretical mediators (eg, knowledge, attitudes). Results At 6-month follow-up RealConsent participants intervened more often (P=.04) and engaged in less sexual violence perpetration (P=.04) compared to controls. In addition, RealConsent participants reported greater legal knowledge of sexual assault (P<.001), greater knowledge of effective consent (P<.001), less rape myths (P<.001), greater empathy for rape victims (P<.001), less negative date rape attitudes (P<.001), less hostility toward women (P=.01), greater intentions to intervene (P=.04), less hyper-gender ideology (P<.001), less positive outcome expectancies for nonconsensual sex (P=.03), more positive outcome expectancies for intervening (P<.001), and less comfort with other men’s inappropriate behaviors (P<.001). Conclusions Our results support the efficacy of RealConsent. Due to its Web-based format, RealConsent has potential for broad-based dissemination thereby increasing its overall public health impact on sexual violence.

1305,Fiction or not? Fifty Shades is associated with health risks in adolescent and young adult females.,"BACKGROUND
No prior study has empirically characterized the association between health risks and reading popular fiction depicting violence against women. Fifty Shades--a blockbuster fiction series--depicts pervasive violence against women, perpetuating a broader social narrative that normalizes these types of risks and behaviors in women's lives. The present study characterized the association between health risks in women who read and did not read Fifty Shades; while our cross-sectional study design precluded causal determinations, an empirical representation of the health risks in women consuming the problematic messages in Fifty Shades is made.


METHODS
Females ages 18 to 24 (n=715), who were enrolled in a large Midwestern university, completed a cross-sectional online survey about their health behaviors and Fifty Shades' readership. The analysis included 655 females (219 who read at least the first Fifty Shades novel and 436 who did not read any part of Fifty Shades). Age- and race-adjusted multivariable models characterized Fifty Shades' readers and nonreaders on intimate partner violence victimization (experiencing physical, sexual and psychological abuse, including cyber-abuse, at some point during their lifetime); binge drinking (consuming five or more alcoholic beverages on six or more days in the last month); sexual practices (having five or more intercourse partners and/or one or more anal sex partner during their lifetime); and using diet aids or fasting for 24 or more hours at some point during their lifetime.


RESULTS
One-third of subjects read Fifty Shades (18.6%, or 122/655, read all three novels, and 14.8%, or 97/655, read at least the first novel but not all three). In age- and race-adjusted models, compared with nonreaders, females who read at least the first novel (but not all three) were more likely than nonreaders to have had, during their lifetime, a partner who shouted, yelled, or swore at them (relative risk [RR]=1.25) and who delivered unwanted calls/text messages (RR=1.34); they were also more likely to report fasting (RR=1.80) and using diet aids (RR=1.77) at some point during their lifetime. Compared with nonreaders, females who read all three novels were more likely to report binge drinking in the last month (RR=1.65) and to report using diet aids (RR=1.65) and having five or more intercourse partners during their lifetime (RR=1.63).


CONCLUSIONS
Problematic depictions of violence against women in popular culture-such as in film, novels, music, or pornography-create a broader social narrative that normalizes these risks and behaviors in women's lives. Our study showed strong correlations between health risks in women's lives-including violence victimization-and consumption of Fifty Shades, a fiction series that portrays violence against women. While our cross-sectional study cannot determine temporality, the order of the relationship may be inconsequential; for example, if women experienced adverse health behaviors first (e.g., disordered eating), reading Fifty Shades might reaffirm those experiences and potentially aggravate related trauma. Likewise, if women read Fifty Shades before experiencing the health behaviors assessed in our study, it is possible that the book influenced the onset of these behaviors by creating an underlying context for the behaviors.",Journal of Women's Health,2014,88,45,6,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""The study showed strong correlations between health risks in women's lives-including violence victimization-and consumption of Fifty Shades, a fiction series that portrays violence against women.""}",1314,11211410,Hailee K.

1310,"“I wanted evidence that my status had changed, so that is why I tested”: experiences with HIV self-testing among female sex workers in Malawi","ABSTRACT HIV testing among female sex workers (FSWs) is an established global health priority. HIV self-testing (HIVST) seems to have the potential to address issues of confidentiality, privacy and convenience among this key population. HIVST, however, may result in unintended consequences as its implementation unfolds in a complex sex work context characterised by unequal power relations, stigma and high HIV prevalence. We aimed to explore the experiences of FSWs with HIVST in the context of retesting and antiretroviral usage in Blantyre, Malawi. We used an ethnographic approach to understand meanings and views around HIVST and retesting. We found high levels of retesting, especially among those on antiretroviral, two of which received “false-negative” results. We identified three broad narratives: (1) retesting in response to experiences in the sex work context, (2) retesting driven by the desire to self-monitor HIV-negative status, and (3) retesting in the hope of sero-reversion. The FSWs’ experiences indicate that the implementation of HIVST in this context is complex with potential for unintended harms such as coercive testing.

1315,"Keeping It Frat: Exploring the Interaction Among Fraternity Membership, Disinhibition, and Hypermasculinity on Sexually Aggressive Attitudes in College-Aged Males","This study examines correlates that contribute to sexually aggressive attitudes toward women. Using a sample that includes 217 college males from 3 southern universities, the study evaluates the relationship between college men’s hypermasculine and sexually aggressive attitudes, as well as how fraternity membership and disinhibition moderate this relationship. We hypothesized that sexually aggressive attitudes would be associated with a 3-way interaction among disinhibition, fraternity membership, and hypermasculine attitudes; this hypothesis was not supported. In addition, we hypothesized a similar 3-way interaction with hostility toward women as the dependent variable, as research suggests this is a precursor to sexually aggressive attitudes. Although this hypothesis was not supported, this study did reveal significant 2-way interactions: Fraternity Membership × Hypermasculinity and Fraternity Membership × Disinhibition.

This novel elucidates the incompatibility of the private and public sphere in Spain, for it is only with the protagonist’s renewal of her commitment to the private sphere that she will save her marriage, despite its negative consequences for her career. Fran’s ambiguous decision to have a child sustains the view that a traditional mentality governs the Spanish private sphere, and that the demands of the public and private spheres are frequently irreconcilable.

Synthesizing three independent lines of research (Haslam’s two senses of humanness, mind perception theory, the stereotype content model), we provide a taxonomy of different phenomena (e.g., animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization, objectification, demonization, etc.) that all fall under the broad category of dehumanization. In our current framework, humanness is understood in terms of two basic dimensions: one concerned with agency, competence, and other characteristics that are seen as uniquely human, and the other concerned with experience, interpersonal warmth, and other characteristics that are seen as the essence of human nature. Combinations of these two dimensions result in a mixed model with four main clusters depicting different ways in which humanness is denied or recognized in others.

1318,SEEING (AND TREATING) OTHERS AS SEXUAL OBJECTS: TOWARD A MORE COMPLETE MAPPING OF SEXUAL OBJECTIFICATION,"Sexual objectification has long been subject to academic enquiry. However, it is only in the last five years that psychologists have focused on measuring the interpersonal aspects of being objectified. In this article, we look first at the varieties of objectification, examining how objectification is conceptualized by different researchers. We examine who is the target of objectification, and who is likely to objectify. This reveals that objectification is widespread; although women tend to be the victims of objectification more than men. Further, we find that sex, aggression, and dislike play important roles for both genders in creating objectification. Although work on the consequences of being objectified is relatively new, we cover this growing area of work. We find that objectification changes both the ways people are viewed and the ways they are treated by others. Finally, we offer some new directions for researchers to move forward research in this domain. Word Count: 150",,2014,79,54,3,False,,1328,3300324,G. Rippon,1403077063,Rebecca M.

1320,Replicability and Pitfalls in the Interpretation of Resampled Data: A Correction and a Randomization Test for Anwar and Fang,"In their article “An Alternative Test of Racial Prejudice in Motor Vehicle Searches: Theory and Evidence,” published in the American Economic Review in 2006, Shamena Anwar and Hanming Fang study racial prejudice in motor vehicle searches by Florida Highway Patrol officers (“troopers”). Their data include the race and ethnicity of the trooper and of the motorist stopped and possibly searched. A search is deemed successful if the trooper finds contraband in the vehicle. Using data on troopers and motorists of three race-ethnicity groups (white non-Hispanic, black, and white Hispanic, with others being dropped), Anwar and Fang compute nine trooper-on-motorist search rates and nine search-success rates. They present a model that exploits this information to test whether troopers go beyond statistical discrimination to racial prejudice. Irrespective of whether troopers exhibit racial prejudice, the model has a crucial testable implication, an implication that concerns the rank-order of the search and search-success rates. Anwar and Fang report that their data neatly fit this predicted rank-order implication with high statistical significance across the board, strongly supporting the soundness of the model. In turn, the model is applied to address the question of racial prejudice. They do not find evidence of racial prejudice, and neither do I—so the present critique does not arrive at results about prejudice contrary to their results. The present critique starts by reporting on my effort to replicate Anwar and Fang’s preliminary rank-order findings. I am unable to replicate two of their nine reported search-success rates, nor can I replicate the reported statistical significance of four of the six Z-statistics and one of the three χ2 test statistics for the rankings of the search-success rates. My new results imply that the empirical support for the model’s soundness is not what Anwar and Fang claim it to be. This problem of irreplicability is my primary point, but I then move on to another matter: My replications draw attention to a neglected statistical caveat in Anwar and Fang’s implementation of the empirical tests of racial prejudice. It turns out that the novel resampling procedure they employ does not provide robust results. I pinpoint the empirical source of this issue and, in an appendix, show how a simple extension to their method improves robustness. In another appendix I put forth an alternative randomization test that seems more appropriate when testing such resampled data.",,2014,56,2,0,False,,1330,73063177,Christopher F.

1321,Confessions of an Impotent Potentate: Reading Daniel 4 through the Lens of Ritual Punishment Theory,"This article offers a rereading of Dan. 4.30 through the lens of a male punishment ritual. It is argued that the punishments God inflicts on Nebuchadnezzar reflect aspects found in a liminal hazing rite. Indeed, one of the primary markers of hazing is the use of sexual degradation as a means to establish the hierarchical division between initiator and initiated. The images found in Dan. 4.30 symbolize the dramatic collapse of Nebuchadnezzar's masculinity as he is made aware of his subordinate place in the universe. To make the case, recent insights from cultural anthropologists regarding male punishment rituals are incorporated. As sexual degradation is a telltale feature within hazing incidents, psychoanalytic criticism and gender criticism help elucidate how Nebuchadnezzar's compulsory embodiment of an animalized existence impacts his masculine identification in the narrative. Finally, it is noted that gender readings of the book of Daniel are few and far between, largely due to the absence of female characters in the book. By framing Daniel 4 within the context of competing masculinities, it is hoped that scholars interested in gender readings of the Bible will be provided with another lens through which to analyze this document.",,2014,10,2,0,False,,1331,144099764,F.

Seventy-six female medical student participants (mean age 24.7) from a southeastern health sciences university were recruited to participate in this study. Perceived sexist events were significantly correlated with depressive symptoms, with the exception of lifetime sexist events, anxious symptoms, and stress. Consistent with predictions, perceived sexist events were also positively correlated with role overload. In addition, role overload was positively correlated with psychological distress. Role overload was found to mediate the relationships between perceived sexist events and psychological distress in this sample, suggesting that it may impact psychological distress more than sexist events.

From the often controversial theories of Radical and Revolutionary Feminists, theory and activism against male violence appears today to be a largely unifying and mobilising issue; one that is central to the contemporary UK feminist movement. Familiar areas of conflict remain however, as power relationships between women trouble notions of unified Sisterhood and solidarity, and raise questions for the means and ends of protest. Where once these debates remained mainly in the domain of small Consciousness Raising or CR groups in women’s homes around the UK, new social media has made virtual CR possible on a much larger scale, involving a new generation in debates and controversies old and new.

1333,Towards Full Citizenship: Correlates of Engagement with the Gender Identity Law among Transwomen in Argentina,"Introduction In May 2012, Argentina passed its “Gender Identity” Law, which aimed to address the legal invisibility, discrimination and marginalization that transgender individuals have historically faced. The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with engagement with the Gender Identity Law among transwomen living in Argentina. Methods Data were derived from a 2013 nationwide, cross-sectional study involving transwomen in Argentina. Using multivariate logistic regression, we assessed the prevalence and factors associated with acquiring a gender-congruent identity card within the first 18 months of enactment of the Gender Identity Law. Results Among 452 transwomen, 260 (57.5%) reported that they had obtained a new gender-congruent identity card. In multivariate analysis, factors positively associated with acquiring a new ID were: previously experiencing discrimination by healthcare workers (adjusted odd ratio [aOR] = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.27–3.20); having engaged in transition procedures (aOR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.58–5.93); and having a job other than sex work (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.06–3.10). Foreign born transwomen were less likely to have obtained a new ID (aOR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06–0.33). Conclusions More than half of transwomen in our sample acquired a new gender-congruent ID within the first 18 months of enactment of the Gender Identity Law. However, access to and uptake of this right has been heterogeneous. In particular, our findings suggest that the most empowered transwomen may have been among the first to take advantage of this right. Although educational level, housing conditions, HIV status and sex work were not associated with the outcome, foreign-born status was a strong negative correlate of new ID acquisition. Therefore, additional efforts should be made in order to ensure that benefits of this founding policy reach all transwomen in Argentina.",PLoS ONE,2014,46,12,0,True,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings suggest that the most empowered transwomen may have been among the first to take advantage of the Gender Identity Law, and additional efforts should be made to ensure that benefits of this founding policy reach all transwomen in Argentina.'}",1343,13690177,Meredith G.

1335,"Socioeconomic Dynamics of Gender Disparity in Childhood Immunization in India, 1992–2006","Background Recent evidence indicated that gender disparity in child health is minimal and narrowed over time in India. However, considering the geographical and socio-cultural diversity in India, the gender gap may persist across disaggregated socioeconomic context which may be masked by average level. This study examines the dynamics of gender disparity in childhood immunization across regions, residence, wealth, caste and religion in India during 1992–2006. Method We used multi-waves of the cross-sectional data of National Family Health Survey conducted in India between 1992–93 and 2005–06. Gender disparity ratio was used to measure the gender gap in childhood immunization across the selected socioeconomic characteristics. Multinomial regression analysis was used to examine the gender gap after accounting for other covariates. Result Results indicate that, at aggregate level, gender disparity in full immunization is minimal and has stagnated during the study period. However, gender disparity – disfavouring female children – becomes apparent across the regions, poor households, and religion - particularly among Muslims. Adjusted gender disparity ratio indicates that, full immunization is lower among female than male children of the western region, poor household and among Muslims. Between 1992–93 and 2005–06, the disparity in full immunization had narrowed in the northern region whereas it had, astonishingly, increased in some of the western and southern states of the country.

Methods:The Involve[ment]t study is a cohort of black and white MSM aged 18–39 years in Atlanta, GA, designed to evaluate individual, dyadic, and community level factors that might explain racial disparities in HIV prevalence. Participants were recruited irrespective of HIV serostatus from community-based venues and from Internet advertisements and were tested for HIV. We assessed respondents' demographics, whether they had engaged in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) within the past 6 months, and attitudes about perceived homophobia, perceived racism, and personal resiliency. Results:Compared with white MSM, black MSM were less likely to report UAI in the past 6 months [odds ratio (OR): 0.59, confidence interval (CI): 0.44 to 0.80], more likely to be HIV positive (OR: 5.05, CI: 3.52 to 7.25), and—among those HIV positive—more likely to report not being aware of their HIV infection (OR: 2.58, CI: 1.18 to 5.65). Greater perceived racism was associated with UAI in the black sample (partial odds ratio: 1.48, CI: 1.10 to 1.99). Overall, perceived homophobia, perceived racism, and resilience were not associated with prevalent HIV infection in our samples. Greater resilience was associated with less perceived homophobia in both black and white samples (Spearman r = −0.27, P < 0.001, for both).

1337,"Population Size, HIV, and Behavior Among MSM in Luanda, Angola: Challenges and Findings in the First Ever HIV and Syphilis Biological and Behavioral Survey","Objectives:To conduct the first population size estimation and biological and behavioral surveillance survey among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Angola. Design:Population size estimation with multiplier method and a cross-sectional study using respondent-driven sampling. Setting:Luanda Province, Angola. Study was conducted in a large hospital. Participants:Seven hundred ninety-two self-identified MSM accepted a unique object for population size estimation. Three hundred fifty-one MSM were recruited with respondent-driven sampling for biological and behavioral surveillance survey. Methods:Interviews and testing for HIV and syphilis were conducted on-site. Analysis used Respondent-Driven Sampling Analysis Tool and STATA 11.0. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses examined factors associated with HIV and unprotected sex. Six imputation strategies were used for missing data for those refusing to test for HIV. Main Outcome:A population size of 6236 MSM was estimated. Twenty-seven of 351 individuals were tested positive. Adjusted HIV prevalence was 3.7% (8.7% crude). With imputation, HIV seroprevalence was estimated between 3.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6 to 6.5] and 10.5% (95% CI: 5.6 to 15.3). Being older than 25 (odds ratio = 10.8, 95% CI: 3.5 to 32.8) and having suffered episodes of homophobia (odds ratio = 12.7, 95% CI: 3.2 to 49.6) significantly increased the chance of HIV seropositivity. Conclusions:Risk behaviors are widely reported, but HIV seroprevalence is lower than expected. The difference between crude and adjusted values was mostly due to treatment of missing values in Respondent-Driven Sampling Analysis Tool. Solutions are proposed in this article. Although concerns were raised about feasibility and adverse outcomes for MSM, the study was successfully and rapidly completed with no adverse effects.",Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes,2014,34,16,2,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The first population size estimation and biological and behavioral surveillance survey among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Angola was successfully and rapidly completed with no adverse effects and risk behaviors are widely reported, but HIV seroprevalence is lower than expected.'}",1347,116743002,G.

1339,"Book Review: Jacques Berlinerblau, Sarah Fainberg and Aurora Nou (eds), Secularism on the Edge: Rethinking Church-State Relations in the United States, France and Israel","Secularism on the Edge is a multidisciplinary edited volume exploring the politics of secularism in the United States, France and Israel. All of the contributions in this book are focused on answering the editors’ call for a more detailed discussion of secularism – one that favours complexity and nuance over polemical arguments. Ultimately, this book is concerned with the academic treatment of secularism. It maintains that much discussion of this topic lacks theoretical clarity, producing, in the authors’ views, an undeserving climate of hostility and scepticism towards secularism and secularisation in all of its various forms. Thus, while it does not afford secularism high and uncritical praise, we can read this book as a cautious and thoughtful attempt to defend ‘the secular’ against those who would essentialise, and subsequently categorise it, as fundamentally flawed. The chapters on the US explore the ways in which contemporary societal debates on religion remain shaped by contestation around the secular intentions or otherwise of its founders. Discussions of France assess the effects which various interpretations and understandings of laïceté have, and have had, on state-society and intra-society relations. The section on Israel complicates the possibility of keeping the ‘religious’ distinct from the ‘secular’ by demonstrating how a minimalist state permits citizens to produce and subsequently navigate the public sphere themselves – producing a hybrid religio-secular society. The book ends with a critical look at the relationship between secularism and gender by unpacking and sometimes dispelling the often mythical equation of secular ‘progress’ with women’s emancipation. Overall, this volume makes a helpful contribution to the literature. It tasks itself with reassessing and improving the current theoretical musings on secularism. In my view, it completes this task successfully. It strikes a satisfactory balance between theory and practice, with many chapters directly attuned to how secularism is received, understood and experienced on the ground. The chapters organised as interviews are particularly successful in this regard. The book is perhaps a little dismissive of what it broadly terms ‘postmodernism’, however. In general, it would have been helpful for some of the introductory chapters to be a little more charitable to different theoretical interventions, as this would have sparked a lively and interesting cross-theoretical discussion. Also, given that this entire volume is concerned with a perceived lack of nuance in the secularism debate, it could have been more precise in the way that it characterises work of a critical nature. Nevertheless, I found this to be an interesting and well-organised book which provides a fresh and timely analysis of a central theme in the humanities and social sciences.",,2017,0,1,1,False,,1349,1401161864,M.

1340,Empirical analysis of the changing pattern of sex segregation of occupation in Ghana,"Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to assess the changing pattern and direction of sex segregation of occupation as a measure of unbalanced distribution of occupation by sex in Ghana between 1960 and 2010, identify the sources of the changes and show whether female-male earnings difference has changed in line with the changes in occupational segregation. Design/methodology/approach - – The paper applies two segregation indices to data from population censuses and household surveys in the empirical analysis Findings - – The outcome of the segregation measure indicates a generally modest to high but declining occupational sex segregation in Ghana over a period of five decades. Sex composition and occupational mix effects are found to be the underlying drivers of the declining segregation with the former coming up strongly during the initial 40 years. This has, however, not translated into narrowing female-male earnings gap. Practical implications - – The paper recommends measures towards economic transformation for a change in occupational structure backed by implementation of education policy to enhance female access to male-dominated science and engineering programmes and employment in high-skill occupations. Originality/value - – The strength of the paper is seen from its originality as it is the first attempt to assess changing pattern of occupational segregation over a long period of five decades with consistent and comparable data sources.",,2014,25,5,1,False,,1350,50563014,M.

Those pursuing ‘public conversations’ must develop strong rhetoric to make their causes salient and of interest to both the public and policymakers. The fact that penal reform is widely considered by journalists as having minimal readership appeal is indicative of the main issue campaigners face. Those seeking to influence policy reform for women are faced with a further barrier, in that social attitudes to male and female offenders differ. What language best, then, for campaigners seeking to influence government policy for women within this climate? Situated within the constructionist paradigm for social problems research, this article seeks to understand the different approaches and strategies – the ‘messaging structures’ or ‘frames’ – used by campaigners to influence politicians, the media and the public.

1348,"What Counts as Rape? The Effect of Offense Prototypes, Victim Stereotypes, and Participant Gender on How the Complainant and Defendant are Perceived","Jurors rely on a range of schemas when evaluating allegations of rape and sexual assault. For example, they may be influenced by the prototypicality of the alleged offense, the stereotypicality of the victim, or gender-related stereotypes. These schemas have often been conflated however, making it difficult to determine the unique impact of each on jurors’ perceptions. To be able to effectively counter any schema-related misconceptions, we must first identify which beliefs are important and when. An experiment (N = 420) examined the independent effects of offense prototypicality and victim stereotypicality on mock jurors’ perceptions. As expected, victim stereotypicality had a greater effect on judgments in the counter-prototypical (acquaintance) assault scenario than in the prototypical (stranger) assault scenario. When the complainant was described as being a counter-stereotypical victim in the acquaintance rape scenario, the defendant was seen as less likely to be guilty and evaluated more positively and the complainant less positively compared with when the complainant was described as being a stereotypical victim. Analysis of the qualitative data suggested a focus on different factors in reaching verdicts in the stranger and acquaintance rape scenarios. Results were interpreted as evidence that jurors “step down” through a hierarchy of schemas in their attempts to determine what happened in cases of rape and sexual assault.",Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2014,74,67,7,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An experiment examined the independent effects of offense prototypicality and victim stereotypicality on mock jurors’ perceptions and suggested a focus on different factors in reaching verdicts in the stranger and acquaintance rape scenarios.'}",1359,4617208,A.

1354,Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Cypriot Labour Market: Distastes or Uncertainty?,"Sexual orientation and employment bias is examined in Cyprus (Republic of Cyprus: Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca, Paphos) by implementing an experiment for the period 2010-2011. The design is aimed at answering three main questions: Do gay and lesbian people face occupational access constraints and entry wage bias than comparable heterosexuals? Do gay and lesbian people benefit from providing more job-related information? Does the differential treatment between gay/lesbian and heterosexual applicants disappear as the information of the applicants increases? Methodologically, we sent applications to advertised vacancies and we experimented with two information sets the 'sexual orientation' and 'information' of the potential applicants. The estimations suggest that gay and lesbian applicants face significant bias than heterosexual applicants. Moreover, both heterosexual and gay/lesbian applicants gain by providing more job-related information. However, the estimations suggest that the informational premium for sexual orientation minorities could not reduce the discriminatory patterns. The current results indicate that discrimination against sexual orientation minorities in the Cypriot labour market is a matter of preference, not the result of limited information. One strategy the Cypriot government may employ is to try to affect public opinion and people's attitudes towards sexual orientation minorities. This is the first nationwide field experiment in the Cypriot labour market and contributes to the literature as it is the first field study on sexual orientation which tries to disentangle statistical from taste-based discrimination in the labour market.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2014,68,56,6,True,,1365,2097232,B.

1357,Neurofeminism and feminist neurosciences: a critical review of contemporary brain research,"To date, feminist approaches to neurosciences have evaluated the debates surrounding practices of knowledge production within and research results of contemporary brain research. Consequently, neurofeminist scholars have critically examined gendered impacts of neuroscientific research. Feminist neuroscientists also develop research approaches for a more gender-appropriate neuroscientific research on several levels. Based on neurofeminist critique feminist neuroscientists aim to enrich neuroscientific work by offering methodological suggestions for a more differentiated setup of categories and experimental designs, for reflective result presentations and interpretations as well as for the analysis of result validity. Reframing neuro-epistemologies by including plasticity concepts works to uncover social influences on the gendered development of the brain and of behavior. More recently, critical work on contemporary neurocultures has highlighted the entanglements of neuroscientific research within society and the implications of ‘neurofacts’ for gendered cultural symbolisms, social practices, and power relations. Not least, neurofeminism critically analyses the portrayal of neuro-knowledge in popular media. This article presents on overview on neurofeminist debates and on current approaches of feminist neurosciences.

1362,"Female and male domestic partners in wine-grape farms (Cognac, France): conjugal asymmetry and gender discrimination in family businesses","Agriculture in contemporary France is dominated by family businesses. On Cognac wine-grape farms, training for the occupation and taking over the business is the result of parents' efforts to socialize one (or more) of their children. This long-term socialization varies by gender. Farm property, professional skills, and the status of business head are in most cases transmitted to male heirs. Female heirs suffer discrimination in their families. If they have one or more brothers, their families take it as a given that a male heir ought to inherit the farm, and that female heirs are ‘not interested.’ To elucidate these phenomena, I will compare two asymmetrical situations, ‘ordinary cases’ – when a male heir heads the grape-growing business – vs. ‘exceptional cases,’ when a female heir is farm head. For the first, I will show that female domestic partners' off-farm salaried labor does not put an end to on-farm productive or financial cooperation in the couple. For the second situation, I show that male domestic partners, working on or off the farm, are always problematic, presenting another obstacle for women wishing to take over a family grape-growing business. By focusing analysis on the asymmetry of female and male domestic partners in family businesses, this article thus makes an empirical contribution to knowledge of discrimination against female business heads.",,2014,69,9,1,False,,1373,36455727,S.

1364,Is there gender bias in reviewer selection and publication success rates for the New Zealand Journal of Ecology,"Gender bias in the sciences is a prominent issue. Evidence suggests that more equal involvement of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields leads to a diversity of working styles that can contribute to multiple measures of workplace success, such as better student outcomes in university settings and improved managerial approaches. One of the main ways we can combat gender bias is by increasing awareness. Thus, to directly draw attention to this issue for New Zealand ecologists, we performed a gender analysis of the publication process in the New Zealand Journal of Ecology (NZJE) for manuscripts reviewed between 2003 and 2012. First, we compared the frequencies of publication success between female and male authors. Second, we compared the frequencies of female and male reviewers selected by both female and male associate editors on the journal’s editorial board from 2010 to 2012. Results show that publication success was not biased by gender, nor was it related to the gender of the editor. However, editors selected more male reviewers and this pattern was slightly more pronounced for male editors, suggesting that there is potential for at least some associate editors to reduce gender bias in their reviewer selections. We believe this will become easier with the development of the new reviewer database and mentoring scheme recently launched by the NZJE. It is important that publication of ecological research in New Zealand is unbiased so that the growing numbers of women in this field are not disadvantaged, and our results show that the NZJE is doing a good job at this. However, it is also important that women’s contributions to the field are encouraged and recognised. We believe that reviewer selection is one way to enhance this and we strongly encourage early-career female ecologists to enrol in the NZJE mentoring scheme.",,2014,42,27,3,False,,1375,3486838,M.

1367,Multiple discriminations experienced by people living with HIV in France: results from the ANRS-Vespa2 study,"Since the advent of AIDS, discrimination has remained at the core of the experience of people living with HIV (PLHIV). PLHIV who belong to minority groups are exposed to discrimination not only on the grounds of their HIV infection but also because of rejecting attitudes towards drug users, homosexuals and black people. This article aimed to measure the frequency of discrimination and assess its correlates among PLHIV in France. We used data from a national representative survey, the ANRS-Vespa2 study, conducted in France in 2011 among 3022 male and female HIV-positive patients followed at hospitals. Respondents answered a face-to-face questionnaire documenting their health status and living conditions. Discrimination was documented during the previous two years on the grounds of HIV infection, gender, country of birth, skin colour, sexual orientation, place of residence, and substance abuse in a variety of contexts. For each context, we performed logistic regressions on discrimination, controlling for socio-epidemiological group, age, education level and employment status. Discrimination is frequently experienced by PLHIV in France (26%), particularly when applying for a job (24%), interacting with family (11%) or seeking health services (8%). Women from sub-Saharan Africa reported the highest levels of discrimination, whereas heterosexual non-African men reported the lowest. Men who have sex with men experienced levels of discrimination that fell between those of these two groups. The major perceived reason for discrimination was HIV status (13%). Nationality, skin colour and sexual orientation were cited by 5% each, whereas gender was cited by 1% of respondents. Our analyses show that discrimination is a frequent and cross-cutting experience with differences across the various contexts and among the diverse subpopulations. The intertwining of HIV-related stigma with sexism, racism and homophobia needs to be addressed to understand why discrimination against PLHIV persists when the disease itself has greatly evolved.",AIDS Care,2014,53,48,2,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Analysis of data from a national representative survey conducted in France in 2011 shows that discrimination is a frequent and cross-cutting experience with differences across the various contexts and among the diverse subpopulations.'}",1378,69464795,J.

Yet observers expected more sportsmanship from women (a) when observers were ideologically motivated by gender-specific beliefs (gender-specific system justification; Study 1) and (b) when system justification was cued experimentally (Study 2).

In the era of multimedia platforms, discussions about the revolutionary possibilities of digital radio recall speculations during the early days of wireless about how the new medium would impact culture.

1370,Attitudes toward rape and attribution of responsibility to rape victims in a Norwegian community sample,"There has been a steady increase in the number of rapes reported to the police in Norway during the past two decades. In this paper we examine factors associated with attitudes toward rape (as measured with 11 items from the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale) and attribution of responsibility to rape victims using a community sample of Norwegian women and men. Analyses of 475 returned questionnaires (32.6% response rate) suggest that men's attitudes toward rape were moderately less disapproving than women's, and that men attributed slightly more responsibility to rape victims than did women. Analysis showed that classical sexism was the strongest predictor of attitudes toward rape, followed by acceptance of intimate partner violence toward women and that rape attitudes were the prime predictor of attribution of responsibility to rape victims. Although Scandinavian countries are consistently ranked among the World's most gender egalitarian societies, the findings from our study do not differ from those from the North American culture with regard to the strengths of known group differences and attitudinal correlates to rape attitudes and attribution of responsibility. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",,2014,48,21,1,False,,1381,33414073,M. Harrison,2071185740,M. Becker,115507664,M. Janze,,,,,,,Psychology,
1371,Planning and Social Media: A Case Study of Public Transit and Stigma on Twitter,"Problem, research strategy, and findings: How media portray public transit services can affect the way voters and stakeholders think about future transit investments. In this study, I examine social media content about public transit from a large sample of Twitter comments, finding that they reflect more negative sentiments about public transit than do the comments about most other public services, and include more negative material about transit patrons. However, transit agencies may be able to influence the tone of those comments through the way they engage with social media. Transit agencies that respond directly to questions, concerns, and comments of other social media users, as opposed to merely “blasting” announcements, have more positive statements about all aspects of services and fewer slurs directed at patrons, independent of actual service quality. The interaction does not have to be customer oriented. Agencies using Twitter to chat with users about their experiences or new service also have statistically significantly more positive sentiments expressed about them on social media. This study's limitations are that it covers only one social media outlet, does not cover all transit agencies, and cannot fully control for differences in transit agency service. Takeaway for practice: Planners committed to a stronger role for public transit in developing sustainable and equitable cities have a stake in the social media strategy of public transit agencies; moreover, they should not let racial and sexist slurs about patrons dominate feeds. Planners should encourage interactive social media strategies. Even agencies that only tweet interactively a few times a day seem to have more civil discussions surrounding their agencies and announcements on Twitter than agencies that use their feed only to blast service announcements.",,2014,15,140,12,False,,1382,2074735962,Laura Mooney,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
1372,‘I'm glad I'm not a Saudi woman’: the First Gulf War and US encounters with Saudi gender relations,"On 6 November 1990, nearly 50 Saudi women staged a protest against the ban on women operating motor vehicles in Saudi Arabia. Occurring in the midst of the First Gulf War, the women's protest was a political statement about the harsh restrictions placed on women in the Middle Eastern country which both reflected and influenced Saudi society’s encounter with their American allies during the war. When United States (US) military personnel flooded into Saudi Arabia during the war, they were shocked at the way American servicewomen were treated by their Saudi allies and the second-class status of Saudi women throughout the country. This article explores Americans' reactions to their encounter with Saudi gender relations during the war and argues that the poor treatment of women in Saudi Arabia—which Americans dubbed ‘gender apartheid’—caused many Americans to question the longstanding US alliance with the conservative Muslim country. In doing so, US journalists, military personnel, scholars and the general public began to demand that concern about women's rights should be integrated seriously into US foreign policy towards the Muslim world.",,2014,95,5,0,False,,1383,6773652,J.

1373,"Why are women underrepresented in Computer Science? Gender differences in stereotypes, self-efficacy, values, and interests and predictors of future CS course-taking and grades","This study addresses why women are underrepresented in Computer Science (CS). Data from 1319 American first-year college students (872 female and 447 male) indicate that gender differences in computer self-efficacy, stereotypes, interests, values, interpersonal orientation, and personality exist. If students had had a positive experience in their first CS course, they had a stronger intention to take another CS course. A subset of 128 students (68 females and 60 males) took a CS course up to one year later. Students who were interested in CS, had high computer self-efficacy, were low in family orientation, low in conscientiousness, and low in openness to experiences were more likely to take CS courses. Furthermore, individuals who were highly conscientious and low in relational-interdependent self-construal earned the highest CS grades. Efforts to improve women’s representation in CS should bear these results in mind.",Computer Science Education,2014,127,223,24,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Students who were interested in CS, had high computer self-efficacy, were low in family orientation, low in conscientiousness, and low in openness to experiences were more likely to take CS courses, and individuals who were highly conscientious andLow in relational-interdependent self-construal earned the highest CS grades.'}",1384,1885803,S.

1374,Constructive Conflict Talk in Classrooms: Divergent Approaches to Addressing Divergent Perspectives,"Abstract Dialogue about social and political conflicts is a key element of democratic citizenship education that is frequently advocated in scholarship but rarely fully implemented, especially in classrooms populated by ethnically and economically heterogeneous students. Qualitative case studies describe the contrasting ways 2 primary and 2 middle-grade teachers in urban Canadian public schools infused conflict dialogue pedagogies into their implemented curricula. These lessons, introducing conflict communication skills and/or content knowledge embodying conflicting viewpoints as learning opportunities, actively engaged a wide range of students. At the same time, even these purposively selected teachers did not often facilitate sustained, inclusive, critical, and imaginative exchange or deliberation about heartfelt disagreements, nor did they probe the diversity and equity questions surrounding these issues. The case studies illustrate a democratic education dilemma: Even in the classrooms of skilled and committed teachers, opportunities for recognition of contrasting perspectives and discussion of social conflicts may not necessarily develop into sustained democratic dialogue nor interrupt prevailing patterns of disengagement and inequity.",,2014,122,71,10,True,,1385,47321370,S.

1375,Gender Roles and Humor in Advertising: The Occurrence of Stereotyping in Humorous and Nonhumorous Advertising and Its Consequences for Advertising Effectiveness,"The advertising literature includes extensive research on the occurrence and effects of gender-role portrayals in advertising. None of these studies has examined the ways in which humor affects depictions and the advertising effectiveness of these portrayals. This article reports the results of content-analytic and experimental studies that investigate the occurrence and effectiveness of gender stereotyping in humorous and nonhumorous advertising. The findings from these studies are in line with the assumptions of information processing theories. They indicate that the way women and men are stereotyped in advertising is dependent on humor; in particular, traditional male stereotypes are more prevalent in humorous ads, whereas traditional female stereotypes are more prevalent in nonhumorous ads. With respect to the influence of these stereotypes, humor improves consumers’ attitudes, particularly if nontraditional stereotyping is utilized instead of traditional stereotyping. Furthermore, humor in stereotyped advertising influences women more than men. Women evaluate gender portrayals more favorably and as more credible in humorous ads than in nonhumorous ads, particularly when nontraditional stereotyping instead of traditional stereotypes are used. These findings provide implications for gender-role and humor research in advertising and for practitioners who wish to increase the effectiveness of ads that use stereotypes.",,2014,77,154,4,False,,1386,108403970,Bardolph Dana,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,Review

All the published issues were examined as primary sources, considering texts and images related to women, particularly those concerning their body education by means of Physical Education and sports. By crossing the empirical sources, it was possible to identify a remarkable defence of the female body constructed by eugenics, whose scientific assumptions took into account body shape and appearance. By regarding the body as an art object to be sculpted through the practice of physical activities, Revista da Educação Physica spread images and discourses favouring a clean, beautiful, healthy, white body whose construction should comprise things that were conventionally assigned as imperatives for women: beauty, motherhood and femininity.",,2014,47,2,0,False,,1387,145833707,J.

1377,What Looks Like Sexism and Why? The Effect of Comment Type and Perpetrator Type on Women's Perceptions of Sexism,"ABSTRACT. Sexist comments are not perceived equally in the eyes of women. We extend previous research by examining the degree to which multiple types of potentially sexist comments made by multiple types of men are perceived as sexist. Further, we examine the degree to which three possible mediators—prototypicality, perceived intent, and interdependence—explained these effects. Female undergraduate students (N = 248) were randomly assigned to read a scenario in which a hostile sexist, benevolent sexist, or objectifying comment was made by one of three types of men: a stranger, their boss, or their boyfriend. Results demonstrate that hostile sexism was perceived as more sexist than benevolent sexism or objectification. Comments made by boyfriends were also rated as less sexist than those made by bosses or strangers. Furthermore, perceptions of prototypicality of the comment or perpetrator and perceived intent to harm mediated the effect of study manipulations on perceptions of sexism.",The Journal of general psychology,2014,45,24,4,False,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is demonstrated that hostile sexism was perceived as more sexist than benevolent sexism or objectification and perceptions of prototypicality of the comment or perpetrator and perceived intent to harm mediated the effect of study manipulations on perceptions of sexism.'}",1388,107635541,Ingrid Osthus,116411580,Vishantie Sewpaul,,,,,,,,,Sociology,JournalArticle

1379,Playing Games and Asking Questions in a Non-WEIRD Sample: Adapting and Testing the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory in Western Burkina Faso,"A recent debate across the social sciences questions the generalizability of research findings obtained from Western Educated Industrialised Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) samples to the rest of humanity at large. In this paper, we aim to adapt and test the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI, Glick & Fiske, 1996), on a small, non-WEIRD sample of men in Burkina Faso. Using a within-participants experimental design we further attempt to cross-validate this adapted ASI with a behavioural measure, namely the dictator game. Generally, the adapted version of the ASI does not perform well in terms of validity and reliability. In the dictator game, women generally receive a larger proportion of the stake than men. While the allocations to male recipients are not related to participants’ levels of hostile or benevolent sexism, there is a significant negative correlation between benevolent sexism and allocations to female recipients.",,2014,34,0,0,False,,1390,6382826,Mikhail Balaev,,,,,,,,,,,"Medicine, Economics","JournalArticle, Review"
