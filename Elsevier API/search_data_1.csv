The sample is composed of 692 people and the data were obtained by administering the ISA scale to measure ambivalent sexism (hostile and benevolent) and the self-identification as feminist scale to measure feminist identification. The results show that men have higher levels of both hostile and benevolent sexism than women, and that women identify more with feminism. We also find that the higher the level of education, the lower the sexist attitudes.

1,"© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, extensive research has been done on how the pandemic has been metaphorised. However, little research has focused on how the pandemic is associated with the depiction of gender relations in political cartoons. Therefore, this study showcases sexism and gender relations by examining how both gender and gender relationships have been expressed metaphorically. It draws on conceptual metaphor theory as well as concepts related to visual metaphors in multimodal discourse, covert sexism, and dehumanisation to analyse a corpus of 100 Arabic cartoons depicting men and women alone and as couples that were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate that typo-pictorial metaphors and those related to body modification, dehumanisation, and the coronavirus are associated with prevalent covert sexism during the pandemic. In short, the findings suggest that COVID-19 has contributed to how women in relationships have been negatively portrayed in Arabic political cartoons. In terms of theoretical implications, the study results show that a more general theory of multimodal sexism in political cartoons should be used to address various types of identifiable sexism in multimodal contexts; this approach is useful for both multimodal scholars and discourse analysts in various disciplines.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Multimodal Communication,21101048855,0,11,Multimodal metaphors and sexism in Arabic cartoons depicting gender and gender relations during COVID-19,0,false,10.1515/mc-2022-0008,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,1,Multimodal Communication,2022.0,24.0,0.0,,151179319,Reem Alkhammash,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,19.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine

We analyze pooled 2017-2019 data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (n persons = 553, 925; n incidents = 32, 470), the first nationally representative and comprehensive survey on crime that allows identification of LGBT persons aged 16 or older. Descriptive and bivariate analysis show that LGBT people experienced 6.6 violent hate crime victimizations per 1,000 persons compared with non-LGBT people’s 0.6 per 1,000 persons (odds ratio = 8.30, 95% confidence interval = 1.94, 14.65). LGBT people were more likely to be hate crime victims of sexual orientation or gender bias crime and less likely to be victims of race or ethnicity bias crimes compared to non-LGBT hate crime victims. Compared to non-LGBT victims, LGBT victims of hate crime were more likely to be younger, have a relationship with their assailant, and have an assailant who is white. Compared to LGBT victims of non-hate violence, more LGBT hate crime victims reported experiencing problems in their social lives, negative emotional responses, and physical symptoms of distress. Our findings affirm claims that hate crimes have adverse physical and psychological effects on victims and highlight the need to ensure that LGBT persons who experience hate crime get necessary support and services in the aftermath of the crime.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,17,"Hate crimes against LGBT people: National Crime Victimization Survey, 2017-2019",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0279363,Public Library of Science,2,PLoS ONE,2022.0,31.0,0.0,,145827927,A.

For example, women generally report more severe asthma symptoms than men; men and women are exposed to different asthma-causing triggers; men tend to be more physically active than women. Furthermore, implicit, often unintended gender bias by healthcare professionals (HCPs) is widespread, and may result in delayed asthma diagnosis, which can be greater in women than men. The sex and gender of the HCP can also impact asthma management. Pregnancy, menstruation, and menopause can all affect asthma in several ways and may be associated with poor asthma control.

4,"© 2022 Canadian Cardiovascular SocietyDefined as a prejudice either for or against something, biases at the provider, patient, and societal level all contribute to differences in cardiovascular disease recognition and treatment, resulting in outcome disparities between sexes and genders. Provider bias in the under-recognition of female-predominant cardiovascular disease and risks might result in underscreened and undertreated patients. Furthermore, therapies for female-predominant phenotypes including nonobstructive coronary artery disease and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are less well researched, contributing to undertreated female patients. Conversely, women are less likely to seek urgent medical attention, potentially related to societal bias to put others first, which contributes to diagnostic delays. Furthermore, women are less likely to have discussions around risk factors for coronary artery disease compared with men, partially because they are less likely to consider themselves at risk for heart disease. Provider bias in interpreting a greater number of presenting symptoms, some of which have been labelled as “atypical,” can lead to mislabelling presentations as noncardiovascular. Furthermore, providers might avoid discussions around certain therapies including thrombolysis for stroke, and cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure, because it is incorrectly assumed that women are not interested in pursuing options deemed more invasive. To mitigate bias, organizations should aim to increase the visibility and involvement of women in research, health promotion, and clinical and leadership endeavours.

Past research has found that individual difference variables (e.g., gender, political conservatism) predict transgender prejudice. In the current research, we aimed to better understand the association between transgender prejudice and 15 individual difference predictors (i.e., gender, sexual orientation, single-item political orientation, social dominance orientation, right wing authoritarianism, religiosity, religious fundamentalism, gender essentialism, gender role beliefs, sexism, gender self-esteem, aggression, lesbian, gay, bisexual [LGB] attitudes, contact with LGB individuals, and contact with transgender individuals) by conducting a random-effects meta-analysis. After screening, 82 studies with a total of 36,285 participants met the criteria and were included in the analyses. Across all studies, all predictors except for gender self-esteem (r =.09; 95% CI [-.004,.18]) were significant in predicting transgender prejudice. Overall, there were small to large effect sizes, with LGB attitudes having the largest magnitude (r =.71; 95% CI [.65,.76]) and aggression having the smallest magnitude (r =.15; 95% CI [.08,.23]).

Much attention has centered around the misogynistic and violent discourse that has taken place in online incel forums as well as manifestos written by incels who have perpetrated deadly attacks. Such work overlooks the experiences and issues faced by incels themselves, the majority of which have not engaged in any violent behavior. Recent Findings: A small number of studies have recruited incels. Results from these studies highlight the nuanced nature of the incel identity. It is also apparent that incels suffer from high levels of romantic rejection and a greater degree of depressive and anxious symptoms, insecure attachment, fear of being single, and loneliness. Summary: Incels report significant issues pertaining to their mental, social, and relational well-being and may seek support from forums that often feature misogynistic and violent content.",2022-12-01,Journal,Review,Current Psychiatry Reports,15011,0,24,"Involuntary Celibacy: A Review of Incel Ideology and Experiences with Dating, Rejection, and Associated Mental Health and Emotional Sequelae",1,true,10.1007/s11920-022-01382-9,Springer,6,Current Psychiatry Reports,2022.0,77.0,0.0,,1994681090,Brandon Sparks,51478664,Alexandra M.

7,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Malaria in western Kenya is currently characterized by sustained high Plasmodial transmission and infection resurgence, despite positive responses in some areas following intensified malaria control interventions since 2006. This study aimed to evaluate long-term changes in malaria transmission profiles and to assess patterns of asymptomatic malaria infections in school children aged 5–15 years at three sites in western Kenya with heterogeneous malaria transmission and simultaneous malaria control interventions. Methods: The study was conducted from 2018 to 2019 and is based on data taken every third year from 2005 to 2014 during a longitudinal parasitological and mosquito adult surveillance and malaria control programme that was initiated in 2002 in the villages of Kombewa, Iguhu, and Marani. Plasmodium spp. infections were determined using microscopy. Mosquito samples were identified to species and host blood meal source and sporozoite infections were assayed using polymerase chain reaction. Results: Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite evaluated during this study (2018–2019). Asymptomatic malaria parasite prevalence in school children decreased in all sites from 2005 to 2008. However, since 2011, parasite prevalence has resurged by > 40% in Kombewa and Marani. Malaria vector densities showed similar reductions from 2005 to 2008 in all sites, rose steadily until 2014, and decreased again. Overall, Kombewa had a higher risk of infection compared to Iguhu (χ2 = 552.52, df = 1, P < 0.0001) and Marani (χ2 = 1127.99, df = 1, P < 0.0001). There was a significant difference in probability of non-infection during malaria episodes (log-rank test, χ2 = 617.59, df = 2, P < 0.0001) in the study sites, with Kombewa having the least median time of non-infection during malaria episodes. Gender bias toward males in infection was observed (χ2 = 27.17, df = 1, P < 0.0001). The annual entomological inoculation rates were 5.12, 3.65, and 0.50 infective bites/person/year at Kombewa, Iguhu, and Marani, respectively, during 2018 to 2019. Conclusions: Malaria prevalence in western Kenya remains high and has resurged in some sites despite continuous intervention efforts. Targeting malaria interventions to those with asymptomatic infections who serve as human reservoirs might decrease malaria transmission and prevent resurgences. Longitudinal monitoring enables detection of changes in parasitological and entomological profiles and provides core baseline data for the evaluation of vector interventions and guidance for future planning of malaria control.

8,"© 2022, The Author(s).Response inhibition is a crucial component of executive control, which refers to our ability to suppress responses that are no longer needed or inappropriate. The stop-signal task is a standard tool to assess inhibitory control over actions. Here, we use irrelevant facial expressions (happy, angry, or neutral) as both go and stop-signal to examine competition for shared attentional resources between (a) emotion and inhibition process and (b) go and stop processes. Participants were required to respond to go signals (gender discrimination task: male or female). Occasionally, a stop-signal (face with irrelevant angry, happy, or neutral facial expression) was presented, and participants were required to withhold their motor response. We found that emotion processing (especially angry faces) captures attention away from the task, and the emotionality of the stop signal matters only when the go signal is non-emotional. When the go signal was non-emotional, we found that stop-signal with irrelevant angry facial expressions impaired inhibitory control compared to stop-signal with irrelevant happy and neutral facial expressions. These results indicate that the processing of emotion and inhibition process exploit a shared pool of attentional resources.

9,"© 2022, The Author(s).Although putting on a mask over our nose and mouth is a simple but powerful way to protect ourselves and others during a pandemic, face masks may interfere with how we perceive and recognize one another, and hence, may have far-reaching impacts on communication and social interactions. To date, it remains relatively unknown the extent to which wearing a face mask that conceals the bottom part of the face affects the extraction of different facial information. To address this question, we compared young adults’ performance between masked and unmasked faces in four different tasks: (1) emotion recognition task, (2) famous face recognition and naming test, (3) age estimation task, and (4) gender classification task. Results revealed that the presence of face mask has a negative impact on famous face recognition and emotion recognition, but to a smaller extent on age estimation and gender classification tasks. More interestingly, we observed a female advantage in the famous face recognition and emotion recognition tasks and a female own-gender bias in gender categorisation and age estimation tasks.

The current study (N = 349 men) collected self-report data from a convenience sample of Incel and non-Incel men to investigate whether the degree of unwanted celibacy is associated with misogynistic attitudes.

11,"© 2022, The Author(s).Purpose: The present study examines the association between psychological violence and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, while comparing the specific subtypes of psychological violence and simultaneously focusing on methodological shortcomings. Method: A systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses were applied on the three main outcomes: PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Four electronic databases were searched (PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science), and a total of 194 studies were included (k = 149 for meta-analyses). GRADEpro was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence from the meta-analyses. Results: Psychological violence had strong associations with the three main outcomes, with the strongest association for PTSD in both female and male victims. Coercive control was particularly associated with PTSD for female victims, while emotional/verbal and dominance/isolation had the strongest association with depression. Although the identified studies were characterized by gender bias, psychological violence appear to affect male mental health too. Discussion: Findings from the meta-analyses support the notion that psychological violence is a traumatic experience, which is strongly association with PTSD and other common mental health problems linked to trauma. GRADEpro rated the certainty of evince to be low, and thus, our confidence in the estimated effect is limited. Gender bias, the applied terminology, and other methodological shortcomings are discussed.

12,"© 2022, The Author(s).The presence, magnitude, and significance of sex differences in the human brain are hotly debated topics in the scientific community and popular media. This debate is largely fueled by studies containing strong, opposing conclusions: either little to no evidence exists for sex differences in human neuroanatomy, or there are small-to-moderate differences in the size of certain brain regions that are highly reproducible across cohorts (even after controlling for sex differences in average brain size). Our Commentary uses the specific comparison between two recent large-scale studies that adopt these opposing views—namely the review by Eliot and colleagues (2021) and the direct analysis of ~ 40k brains by Williams and colleagues (2021)—in an effort to clarify this controversy and provide a framework for conducting this research. First, we review observations that motivate research on sex differences in human neuroanatomy, including potential causes (evolutionary, genetic, and environmental) and effects (epidemiological and clinical evidence for sex-biased brain disorders). We also summarize methodological and empirical support for using structural MRI to investigate such patterns. Next, we outline how researchers focused on sex differences can better specify their study design (e.g., how sex was defined, if and how brain size was adjusted for) and results (by e.g., distinguishing sexual dimorphisms from sex differences). We then compare the different approaches available for studying sex differences across a large number of individuals: direct analysis, meta-analysis, and review. We stress that reviews do not account for methodological differences across studies, and that this variation explains many of the apparent inconsistencies reported throughout recent reviews (including the work by Eliot and colleagues). For instance, we show that amygdala volume is consistently reported as male-biased in studies with sufficient sample sizes and appropriate methods for brain size correction. In fact, comparing the results from multiple large direct analyses highlights small, highly reproducible sex differences in the volume of many brain regions (controlling for brain size). Finally, we describe best practices for the presentation and interpretation of these findings. Care in interpretation is important for all domains of science, but especially so for research on sex differences in the human brain, given the existence of broad societal gender-biases and a history of biological data being used justify sexist ideas. As such, we urge researchers to discuss their results from simultaneously scientific and anti-sexist viewpoints.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Biology of Sex Differences,21100283775,0,13,Sex differences in the human brain: a roadmap for more careful analysis and interpretation of a biological reality,1,true,10.1186/s13293-022-00448-w,BioMed Central Ltd,12,Biology of Sex Differences,2022.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The Commentary uses the specific comparison between two recent large-scale studies that adopt these opposing views to clarify this controversy and provide a framework for conducting research on sex differences in the human brain.'}",28059834,Alex R.

We tested whether the perceived importance of childbearing and hostile sexism mediate the relationship between religiosity and homophobia. We also tested the relative importance of two mediators and if they sequentially mediated the religiosity–homophobia relationship. Finally, we tested if gender moderates these effects. Methods: Data from 49 countries with 70,867 participants collected by the seventh wave of the World Values Survey between 2017 and 2020 were analyzed using mediation and moderation techniques. Results: The perceived importance of childbearing and hostile sexism explain the relationship between religiosity and homophobia. More specifically, the perceived importance of childbearing mediates the religiosity–homophobia relationship, and it mediates the relationship more strongly than hostile sexism. Additionally, hostile sexism and the perceived importance of childbearing sequentially mediate the religiosity–homophobia relationship. This sequential mediation effect is stronger for men than for women. Similarly, the mediation effect of hostile sexism for the religiosity–homophobia relationship is stronger for men than for women. Conclusions: The perceived importance of childbearing and hostile sexism explain the likely impact of religiosity on homophobia, which should be considered in psychological interventions and prevention programs.

15,"© The Author(s) 2022.Sexual assault is a significant problem within the United States military. Bystander intervention skills training is recognized as a promising strategy for sexual assault prevention within both civilian and military populations. Sexual assault prevention programs which include training in bystander intervention teach individuals to notice situations that may pose a risk for harm and safely act to positively influence the outcome. This study examines correlates of bystander intervention attitudes and intentions among young adult active duty male soldiers (N = 282) between the ages of 18 and 24. Positive bystander intervention attitudes and intentions were associated with lower levels of rape myth acceptance, greater discomfort with sexism, lower likelihood of continuing an unwanted sexual advance after verbal resistance from a partner, greater likelihood of gaining verbal consent from a partner, and greater perceived peer approval for bystander intervention. In a multiple regression, perceived peer approval for bystander intervention and self-reported lower likelihood of continuing a sexual advance after verbal resistance from a partner emerged as significant predictors of positive bystander intervention attitudes and intentions (R2 =.41). Given that perceptions of peer norms are modifiable, these findings highlight the importance of addressing peer norms in bystander intervention training programs for military personnel.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,0,37,Correlates of Bystander Intervention Attitudes and Intentions Among Young Adult Active Duty Male Soldiers,0,false,10.1177/08862605221080151,SAGE Publications Inc.,15,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2022.0,61.0,0.0,,6460247,Lindsay M.

16,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: In Switzerland, there is a lack of adequate rehabilitation services, and effective coordination, that take into account the multifactorial health risks of older people. The literature shows that the hospitalisation rate in rehabilitation facilities has increased in recent years and that a gender bias exists. Additionally, there is little or no evidence available on the effect that a post-acute care programme might have over an extended period on functioning, quality of life and the informal network of older people. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the sustainability of post-acute care within three nursing homes in Zurich, Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Methods: The Prevention Admission into Nursing homes (PAN) study is a explorative, prospective, longitudinal pilot trial based on a convenience sample of three long-term care facilities in the Swiss Canton of Zurich. The proposed pilot study will examine the effects of a post-acute care programme on people aged ≥65 years with a post-acute care potential ≥ three admitted to any of the three post-acute care units (n = 260). Older people of all sexes admitted to one of the post-acute care units and likely to be discharged to home within 8 weeks will be eligible for participation in the study. The primary endpoint is functionality based on the Barthel Index. The secondary endpoints are independency based on delirium, cognition, mobility, falling concerns, frailty, weight/height/body mass index, post-acute care capability, quality of life, and lastly, the informal network. As part of process evaluation, a qualitative evaluation will be conducted based on constructive grounded theory to specifically analyse how the experience of informal caregivers (n = 30) can contribute to a successful daily life 6 months after discharge. Discussion: We expect to observe improved functional status and independence after the post-acute care programme. The qualitative evaluation conducted with caregivers will complement our description of the transition of older people towards living at home.

17,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: The sex ratio at birth (SRB; ratio of male to female births) in Nepal has been reported around the normal level on the national level. However, the national SRB could mask the disparity within the country. Given the demographic and cultural heterogeneities in Nepal, it is crucial to model Nepal SRB on the subnational level. Prior studies on subnational SRB in Nepal are mostly based on reporting observed values from surveys and census, and no study has provided probabilistic projections. We aim to estimate and project SRB for the seven provinces of Nepal from 1980 to 2050 using a Bayesian modeling approach. Methods: We compiled an extensive database on provincial SRB of Nepal, consisting 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys and 2011 Census. We adopted a Bayesian hierarchical time series model to estimate and project the provincial SRB, with a focus on modelling the potential SRB imbalance. Results: In 2016, the highest SRB is estimated in Province 5 (Lumbini Pradesh) at 1.102, corresponding to 110.2 male births per 100 female births, with a 95% credible interval (1.044, 1.127) and the lowest SRB is in Province 2 at 1.053 (1.035, 1.109). The SRB imbalance probabilities in all provinces are generally low and vary from 16% in Province 2 to 81% in Province 5 (Lumbini Pradesh). SRB imbalances are estimated to have begun at the earliest in 2001 in Province 5 (Lumbini Pradesh) with a 95% credible interval (1992, 2022) and the latest in 2017 (1998, 2040) in Province 2. We project SRB in all provinces to begin converging back to the national baseline in the mid-2030s. By 2050, the SRBs in all provinces are projected to be around the SRB baseline level. Conclusions: Our findings imply that the majority of provinces in Nepal have low risks of SRB imbalance for the period 1980–2016. However, we identify a few provinces with higher probabilities of having SRB inflation.

18,"© The Author(s) 2022.Sexual harassment and other forms of gendered discrimination are social psychological phenomena, yet the psychological impact of sexual harassment has rarely been examined through a model which considers the role of diverse content of gender identity (i.e. norms). We used an experimental design to investigate how salient norms associated with the social identity of ‘women’ affect coping with sexual harassment. Participants who identified as women (N = 291) were randomly assigned to either a feminist, traditional feminine, or control norm condition, in which the salience of particular norms associated with womanhood was manipulated. Participants completed measures of personal growth (as a proxy for post-traumatic growth), and help-seeking intentions in response to a hypothetical sexual harassment scenario. Participants in the feminist condition reported significantly greater personal growth relative to those in the traditional feminine and control conditions. Participants in both the feminist and traditional feminine conditions reported significantly greater intentions to seek help from formal supports (e.g. primary care doctor), relative to those in the control condition. The findings suggest that the salience of social identities and their content may be valuable resources in promoting recovery following experiences of gendered discrimination and support the role of social identities in influencing post-trauma trajectories.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,1,37,What Does it Mean to be a Woman?

19,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Gender discrimination (GD) has been frequently linked to mental health. The heterogeneity of how GD is defined has led to variation around the analysis of GD. This might affect the study of the association between GD and health outcomes. The main goal of this systematic scoping review is to operationalize the definition of the GD construct. Methods: Three search strategies were set in Pubmed, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The first strategy obtained results mainly about women, while the second focused on men. The third strategy focused on the identification of GD questionnaires. The prevalence of GD, factors and consequences associated with GD perception, and forms of discrimination were the principal variables collected. Risk of bias was assessed (PROSPERO:CRD42019120719). Results: Of the 925 studies obtained, 84 were finally included. 60 GD questionnaires were identified. GD prevalence varied between 3.4 and 67 %. Female gender and a younger age were the factors most frequently related to GD. Poorer mental health was the most frequent consequence. Two components of the GD construct were identified: undervaluation (different recognition, opportunities in access, evaluation standards and expectations) and different treatment (verbal abuse and behaviour).

However, the costs associated with infectious disease are often greater for females than males. Sexist attitudes toward females may have in part emerged from disease-avoidance concerns, in order to decrease infectious disease threat and promote reproductive success for females (and males indirectly). Across three studies, disease-avoidance tendencies were positively correlated with benevolent sexism (perceiving females as pure and in need of protection). Hostile sexism, or more traditional negative attitudes toward females, was inconsistently related to disease avoidance. Furthermore, right-wing authoritarianism partially accounted for the relation between disease avoidance and benevolent sexism, whereas right-wing authoritarianism fully accounted for the relation between disease avoidance and hostile sexism. By encouraging traditional sex roles and restricting female sexual behavior, benevolent sexism may reduce infectious disease threat in females, while maintaining positive relations between the sexes (unlike hostile sexism), which is important for reproduction.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Current Psychology,13479,1,41,Disease avoidance: A predictor of sexist attitudes toward females,0,false,10.1007/s12144-020-01343-6,Springer,20,Current Psychology,2021.0,69.0,0.0,,1662752096,Holly N.

21,"© 2022 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Discrimination is not only an objective fact but also a subjective judgment. While extensive research has studied discrimination as an objective fact, we study the judgment of discrimination and show that it is malleable while holding objective discrimination constant. We focus on a common situation in real life: the constituent groups in a candidate pool are unequal (e.g., fewer female candidates than male candidates for tech jobs), and observers (e.g., the public) see only one side of the decision outcome (e.g., only the hired applicants, not the rejected ones). Ten experiments reveal a framing effect: people judge the decision-maker (e.g., the tech firm) as more discriminatory against the minority in the candidate pool if people see the composition of the accepted candidates than if they see the composition of the rejected candidates, even though the information in the two frames is equivalent (i.e., knowing the information in one frame is sufficient to infer the information in the other). The framing effect occurs regardless of whether the decision-maker is objectively discriminatory, replicates across diverse samples (Americans, Asians, and Europeans) and types of discrimination (e.g., gender, race, political orientation), and has significant behavioral consequences. We theorize and show that the framing effect arises because, when judging discrimination, people overlook information that they could infer but is not explicitly given, and they expect equality in the composition of the constituent groups in their given frame. This research highlights the fallibility of judged discrimination and suggests interventions to reduce biases and increase accuracy.",2022-11-22,Journal,Article,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,21121,0,119,A framing effect in the judgment of discrimination,1,true,10.1073/pnas.2205988119,National Academy of Sciences,21,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,4777870,Christopher K.

22,"Copyright © 2022 Sarwar.Sexual harassment (SH) in sporting environments has developed as an important field of research. However, a more comprehensive understanding of factors affecting SH behavior is needed. We hypothesized how these effects appear and the scenarios in which they exist. Based on the perspectives of SH, this study aims to reveal the athletes’ perceptions of SH and organizational climate (OC) impacts on SH, as well as the mediating mechanisms of low self-esteem (LSE) and the moderating role of hostile sexism (HS). Data collected from 422 female athletes in Pakistan, using random sampling and using SEM techniques analyze that these factors are responsible of increased likelihood of female athlete SH. Our results suggest that athletes’ perceptions of OC positively predict SH, and OC is positively related to LSE. In addition, LSE partially mediates the positive effects of athletes’ perceptions of OC on SH, where HS strengthens the perceived relationship between OC and LSE, which stimulates the SH of athletes. The overall model predictive ability was carried out by moderated mediation model. This study had deep implications for the literature. It clarified the ways that are crucial for predicting OC. Whether there are written laws on the subject, organizations are reluctant to acknowledge them, which entails developing methods of quantifying SH and creating data accessible to the public.

26,"© 2022 The AuthorsBackground: Gender discrimination may be a novel mechanism through which gender inequality negatively affects the health of women and girls. We investigated whether children's mental health varied with maternal exposure to perceived gender discrimination. Methods: Complete longitudinal data was available on 2,567 mother-child dyads who were enrolled between March 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992 in the European Longitudinal Cohort Study of Pregnancy and Childhood-Czech cohort and were surveyed at multiple time points between pregnancy and child age up to 15 years. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administered at child age 7, 11, and 15 years to assess child emotional/behavioural difficulties. Perceived gender discrimination was self-reported in mid-pregnancy and child age 7 and 11 years. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression of SDQ scores were estimated. Mediation was tested using structural equation models. Findings: Perceived gender discrimination, reported by 11.2% of mothers in mid-pregnancy, was related to increased emotional/behavioural difficulties among children in bivariate analysis (slope = 0.24 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.15, 0.32], p<0.0001) and in the fully adjusted model (slope = 0.18 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.27], p<0.0001). Increased difficulties were evident among children of mothers with more depressive symptoms (slope = 0.04 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.05], p<0.0001), boys (slope = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.19, 0.34], p<0.0001), first children (slope = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.23], p<0.0001), and families under financial hardship (slope = 0.09 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.14], p<0.0001). Effects were attenuated for married mothers (slope-0.12 [95% CI: -0.22, -0.01], p<0.05]. Maternal depressive symptoms and financial hardship mediated about 37% and 13%, respectively, of the total effect of perceived gender discrimination on SDQ scores. Interpretation: Perceived gender discrimination among child-bearing women in family contexts was associated with more mental health problems among their children and adolescents, extending prior research showing associations with maternal mental health problems. Maternal depressive symptoms and, to a lesser extent, financial hardship both partially mediated the positive relationship between perceived gender discrimination and child emotional/behavioural problems. This should be taken into consideration when measuring the societal burden of gender inequality and gender-based discrimination. Moreover, gender-based discrimination affects more than one gender and more than one generation, extending to boys in the household even moreso than girls, highlighting that gender discrimination is everyone's issue. Further research is required on the intergenerational mechanisms whereby gender discrimination may lead to maternal and child mental health consequences.

In general, the pelvis and skull are the skeletal regions used most often, but in many cases, they are missing or fragmentary. In such circumstances, where only limb bones are present, it is necessary to use techniques based on other skeletal elements. Metric traits of the long bones of the lower extremities have been reported as reliable indicators of sex. This study was designed to determine whether the two main long bones of the leg, the femur and tibia, can be used for the assessment of sex on a Greek skeletal population. The skeletal sample used in this study comes from the modern human skeletal collection that is currently housed at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and is known as The Athens Collection. It consists of 371 femora and 372 tibiae corresponding to 200 adult individuals (111 males and 89 females). The age range is 19–96 years for males and 20–99 years for females. The maximum lengths and epiphyseal widths were measured for the present study, and it was found that the discriminant analysis of the metrical data of each long bone provided high sex discrimination accuracies. The rate of correct sex discrimination based on different long bones ranged from 91.50 % (left femur) to 93.40 % (left tibia). Our results suggest that lower limb bones can be used effectively for sexing in forensic contexts, in addition to other sex assessment techniques.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Legal Medicine,27775,0,59,Biometric sex assessment from the femur and tibia in a modern Greek population,1,true,10.1016/j.legalmed.2022.102126,Elsevier B.V.,27,Legal Medicine,2022.0,52.0,0.0,,122835601,C.

Journal of Forensic Sciences published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Academy of Forensic Sciences.Previous 3D superimposition studies of digital scans of the human palate, using geometric and surface morphology comparisons, have shown its usefulness in assisting in the identification process, including its ability to distinguish identical twins. This study aimed to evaluate the discriminative potential when only simple geometric analysis is used. Its aim is not only to determine if geometric comparison alone is sufficient not only to assist in identification but if it supports the hypothesis of assisting in sex discrimination when no other comparative data is available. The palates of 64 monozygotic (M.Z.T.) and 39 dizygotic (D.Z.T.) twins were digitized three times using a scanner. Digital smoothing was used to remove the rugae, and palatal height, depth, and width were measured. The study confirmed that the smoothing function had little effect on the discriminatory function since the Mean Absolute Distance (MAD) between M.Z.T. (0.430 ± 0.018 mm versus 0.425 ± 0.022 mm p = 0.061) or D.Z.T. (0.621 ± 0.058 mm versus 0.586 ± 0.053 mm, p = 0.284) scans show little change. By combining the height, depth, and width into a discriminative function, the sex correctly correlated 83.9% of the time, identity by 91.2% sensitivity, and twining by 68.5%. The difference in the 3D palatal model between twin siblings is primarily due to palate geometrics. Since geometric comparison requires far less computation time, geometric comparison alone can be used as an adjunct metric for limiting the possible matches in a dental 3D database in determining both sex and identity, especially if no other evidence is available.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Forensic Sciences,27769,0,67,The discriminative potential of palatal geometric analysis for sex discrimination and human identification,1,true,10.1111/1556-4029.15110,John Wiley and Sons Inc,28,Journal of Forensic Sciences,2022.0,55.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Since geometric comparison requires far less computation time, geometric comparison alone can be used as an adjunct metric for limiting the possible matches in a dental 3D database in determining both sex and identity, especially if no other evidence is available.'}",92673363,B.

29,"© 2022 The AuthorsBatten disease, also known as the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), is a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders mainly affecting children. NCL are characterised by seizures, loss of vision, and progressive motor and cognitive decline, and are the most common form of childhood dementia. At least one type of Batten disease and three types of mouse disease models show sex differences in their severity and progression. Scientific research has a recognised prevalent omission of female animals when using model organisms for basic and preclinical research. Sex bias and omission in research using animal models of Batten disease may affect understanding and treatment development. We conducted a systematic review of research publications since the first identification of NCL genes in 1995, identifying those using animal models. We found that <10 % of these papers considered sex as a biological variable. There was consistent omission of female model organisms in studies. This varied over the period but is improving; one third of papers considered sex as a biological variable in the last decade, and there is a noticeable increase in the last 5 years. The wide-ranging reasons for this published sex bias are discussed, including misunderstanding regarding oestrogen, impact on sample size, and the underrepresentation of female scientists. Their implications for Batten disease and future research are considered. Recommendations going forward support requirements by funders for consideration of sex in all stages of experimental design and implementation, and a role for publishers, families and others with a particular interest in Batten disease.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Basis of Disease,21722,0,1868,Sex bias and omission exists in Batten disease research: Systematic review of the use of animal disease models,1,true,10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166489,Elsevier B.V.,29,Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Basis of Disease,2022.0,100.0,0.0,,47616929,A.

30,"© 2022 The British Psychological Society.Two studies (total N = 778) looked at (1) how people react to research finding a sex difference depending on whether the research puts men or women in a better light and (2) how well people can predict the average man and average woman's reactions. Participants read a fictional popular-science article about fictional research finding either a male- or a female-favouring sex difference. The research was credited to either a male or a female lead researcher. In both studies, both sexes reacted less positively to differences favouring males; in contrast to our earlier research, however, the effect was larger among female participants. Contrary to a widespread expectation, participants did not react less positively to research led by a female. Participants did react less positively, though, to research led by a male when the research reported a male-favouring difference in a highly valued trait. Participants judged male-favouring research to be lower in quality than female-favouring research, apparently in large part because they saw the former as more harmful. In both studies, participants predicted that the average man and woman would exhibit substantial own-sex favouritism, with both sexes predicting more own-sex favouritism from the other sex than the other sex predicted from itself. In making these predictions, participants overestimated women's own-sex favouritism, and got the direction of the effect wrong for men. A greater understanding of the tendency to overestimate gender-ingroup bias could help quell antagonisms between the sexes.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,British Journal of Psychology,12775,0,113,"Reactions to research on sex differences: Effect of sex favoured, researcher sex, and importance of sex-difference domain",0,false,10.1111/bjop.12580,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,30,British Journal of Psychology,2022.0,26.0,0.0,,1401844002,Steve Stewart-Williams,1830397344,Xiu Ling Wong,1830393319,Chern Yi Marybeth Chang,145644138,Andrew G.

Political Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Society of Political Psychology.Despite being a defining issue in the culture war, the political psychology of abortion attitudes remains poorly understood. We address this oversight by reviewing existing literature and integrating new analyses of several large-scale, cross-sectional, and longitudinal datasets to identify the demographic and ideological correlates of abortion attitudes. Our review and new analyses indicate that abortion support is increasing modestly over time in both the United States and New Zealand. We also find that a plurality of respondents (43.8%) in the United States are consistently “pro-choice,” whereas 14.8% are consistently “pro-life,” across various elective and traumatic abortion scenarios. We then show that age, religiosity, and conservatism correlate negatively, whereas Openness to Experience correlates positively, with abortion support. New analyses of heterosexual couples further reveal that women's and men's religiosity decrease their romantic partner's abortion support. Noting inconsistent gender differences in attitudes toward abortion, we then discuss the impact of traditional gender-role attitudes and sexism on abortion attitudes and conclude that, rather than misogyny, benevolent sexism—the belief that women should be cherished and protected—best explains opposition to abortion. Our review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the demographic and ideological variables that underly abortion attitudes and, hence, the broader culture war.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Political Psychology,22861,3,43,Abortion Attitudes: An Overview of Demographic and Ideological Differences,1,true,10.1111/pops.12803,John Wiley and Sons Inc,31,Political Psychology,2022.0,158.0,0.0,,31814753,D.

Herein, the present study establishes that how ATR FT-IR spectroscopy could be utilized as a non-destructive, non-invasive, and confirmatory technique for sex discrimination from dry urine traces. Traces of body fluids are of paramount importance to criminal investigations as a major source of individualization by DNA profiling. However, the significance of DNA profiling from urine traces is highly diminished due to the small amount of DNA in urine traces. For that reason, the sex discrimination between the male and female donors is sorely desirable. In this study, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model unequivocally demonstrated the successful sex discrimination of an individual from dry traces of urine with 95.3% accuracy. PCA-Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) approach provided 85.2% of accuracy; however, PCA could not provide the sufficient findings for the discrimination of male and female urine spectra.

English language.In the 1970s rape became a central focus of second-wave feminist activism, and also, as censorship waned, a frequent narrative event in New Hollywood cinema, often, as a number of critics noted, in strikingly misogynistic forms. A few films, however, reflect and engage with second-wave feminism’s new perspectives on sexual assault. Sidney Furie’s The Entity (1982) uses its horror premise, a woman repeatedly raped by an invisible, aethereal attacker, as a powerful metaphor for what feminists termed ‘rape culture’. The film enlists our identification with, and sympathy for, its protagonist in her struggle against both the invisible rapist and against a medical establishment that denies the truth of her experience.

First, we assessed whether sexism and violence justification affect awareness of gender-based cyberviolence. Second, this effect was evaluated considering the smartphone usage. Third, we studied differences in awareness of OGV according to gender, digital generation, and academic field of study. Fourth, we tested for multiple associations of attitudinal variables, smartphone usage, and sociodemographic variables with OGV. The study involved 453 young adults from the Andalucia region, Spain (Mage = 21.9, SD = 2.15; 64% women). The results showed that, with more sexist attitudes and normalization of violence, the limits regarding what constitute gender-based violence in digital media are more permissive (less awareness). Regarding smartphone use, when it became problematic, desensitization to cyberviolence against women and sexual and gender minorities increased. Multiple correspondence analysis revealed an observer profile, that is, a woman studying for a humanistic or healthcare career who does not believe in psychosocial sex differences, or that violence as a reaction is justified, and also does not support biological fatalism of sexism and violence.

The objective of this study was to explore the personal and professional challenges, practice barriers, and level of satisfaction among female urologists/urology trainees in India. Methods: A strictly confidential and anonymous 26-item questionnaire with respect to professional and personal challenges, workplace discrimination, and family satisfaction was circulated as a Google form through email and WhatsApp to all the female members of the USI (full and associate) and trainees (n = 48) based on identification from the USI directory. Results: Thirty-three out of 48 female urologists responded (68%). Among the respondents (n = 33), majority had <5 years of experience (60.6%), of which 30.3% were residents, which reflected a recent surge in women joining urology. Majority (57.7%) chose to subspecialize, commonly in 'female urology'. Many (72.7%) were encouraged to take this subspecialty. Gender discrimination at workplace was reported by 54.5%, commonly by patients and consultants. 68% of respondents had conceived either before or during residency, leading to additional domestic responsibilities. 9.1% suffered a pregnancy-related complication, which they believed was a direct consequence of their work environment. These obstacles led to 30.3% of women reporting that their personal life had compromised their careers. Professional dissatisfaction was reported by 60.1% of women, with common causes being less operative time than male counterparts and lack of mentorship. Despite these challenges given a chance, 78.7% would choose urology again, and 66.7% would encourage their daughter to pursue a career in urology.

This is likely tied to implicit gender biases against women in authority. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of gender biases that appear in online political discussion. To this end, we collect 10 million comments on Reddit in conversations about male and female politicians, which enables an exhaustive study of automatic gender bias detection. We address not only misogynistic language, but also other manifestations of bias, like benevolent sexism in the form of seemingly positive sentiment and dominance attributed to female politicians, or differences in descriptor attribution. Finally, we conduct a multi-faceted study of gender bias towards politicians investigating both linguistic and extra-linguistic cues. We assess 5 different types of gender bias, evaluating coverage, combinatorial, nominal, sentimental and lexical biases extant in social media language and discourse. Overall, we find that, contrary to previous research, coverage and sentiment biases suggest equal public interest in female politicians. Rather than overt hostile or benevolent sexism, the results of the nominal and lexical analyses suggest this interest is not as professional or respectful as that expressed about male politicians. Female politicians are often named by their first names and are described in relation to their body, clothing, or family; this is a treatment that is not similarly extended to men. On the now banned far-right subreddits, this disparity is greatest, though differences in gender biases still appear in the right and left-leaning subreddits.

The detection of troponin levels beyond the 99th percentile is included in the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, specifically recommending the use of sex-specific thresholds. Measurable concentrations below the proposed diagnostic thresholds have been shown to inform prognosis in different categories of inpatients and outpatients. However, clinical investigations from the last twenty years have yielded conflicting results regarding the incremental value of using different cut-offs for men and women. While advocates of a sex-specific approach claim it may help reduce gender bias in cardiovascular medicine, particularly in acute coronary syndromes, other groups question the alleged incremental diagnostic and prognostic value of sex-specific thresholds, ultimately asserting that less is more. In the present review, we aimed to synthesize our current understanding of sex-based differences in cardiac troponin levels and to reappraise the available evidence with regard to (i) the prognostic significance of sex-specific diagnostic thresholds of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays compared to common cut-offs in both men and women undergoing cardiovascular disease risk assessment, and (ii) the clinical utility of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays for cardiovascular disease prevention in women.",2022-10-01,Journal,Review,Biomolecules,21100394188,1,12,Prognostic Value of High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin in Women,1,true,10.3390/biom12101496,MDPI,38,Biomolecules,2022.0,86.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The present review aimed to synthesize the current understanding of sex-based differences in cardiac troponin levels and to reappraise the available evidence with regard to the prognostic significance and clinical utility of high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin assays for cardiovascular disease prevention in women.'}",1782498849,G.

In two correlational studies, we examined possible antecedents of people’s willingness to participate in the #MeToo campaign by focusing on the role of ambivalent beliefs toward women and men and the perceived effects of the movement. Men (Study 1) and women (Study 2) were asked to answer questions concerning hostile and benevolent beliefs about women and men, respectively, their perception of the beneficial and detrimental effects of #MeToo, and their intentions to participate in the campaign. Study 1 showed that men’s hostile sexism toward women was associated with fewer intentions to actively support the #MeToo campaign and that the reduced beliefs that the movement had beneficial effects mediated this relation. Study 2 revealed that women’s stronger benevolent beliefs about men were associated with decreased perception that the #MeToo campaign had a beneficial impact. In turn, such a perception was related to lower intentions to participate in supporting the campaign. Moreover, women’s hostility toward men explained the intention to join the #MeToo movement through the mediation of the perception that the campaign was beneficial.

41,"© 2022In this paper we present a benchmark dataset generated as part of a project for automatic identification of misogyny within online content, which focuses in particular on memes. The benchmark here described is composed of 800 memes collected from the most popular social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit, and consulting websites dedicated to collection and creation of memes. To gather misogynistic memes, specific keywords that refer to misogynistic content have been considered as search criterion, considering different manifestations of hatred against women, such as body shaming, stereotyping, objectification and violence. In parallel, memes with no misogynist content have been manually downloaded from the same web sources. Among all the collected memes, three domain experts have selected a dataset of 800 memes equally balanced between misogynistic and non-misogynistic ones. This dataset has been validated through a crowdsourcing platform, involving 60 subjects for the labelling process, in order to collect three evaluations for each instance. Two further binary labels have been collected from both the experts and the crowdsourcing platform, for memes evaluated as misogynistic, concerning aggressiveness and irony.

42,"© The Author(s) 2022.This research article undertakes a timely interrogation of the anti-woman digital practices on social media environments, particularly Twitter – specifically, practices seeped in gender bigotry and ageism. It introduces the relatively unexplored concept of digital temporality vis-à-vis digital feminist analysis, and relies, to a limited extent, on empirically examining Indian Twitter primarily and American and Australian Twitter to a lesser extent. The article analyses how image-aesthetics for women, dependent on their age (manifested in appearance and perception of women’s digital image), are a patriarchy-propped digital trend and how that promotes a culture of digital ageism, predicated on women’s appearance. This study also examines and establishes how women users on Twitter are susceptible to continual ageing as images on the digital screen and how digital ageing is a gendered phenomenon. The scope of this article is to examine digital ageism from theoretical perspectives, and offer empirical examples from news portals and Twitter media to substantiate some crucial arguments. This project, of course, also opens more scope to quantitatively account for digital ageism through detailed empirical studies as is also the scope to examine the various subversive tools that could potentially be utilized in gendered rubrics to defy or negate sexist ageism on social media.",2022-10-01,Journal,Article,Convergence,5700153276,0,28,Ageing on the internet: Feminist perspectives on sexist practices,0,false,10.1177/13548565221085817,SAGE Publications Ltd,42,Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies,2022.0,33.0,0.0,,119108136,Ila Ahlawat,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This type of discourse is particularly virulent against the political class and against feminism. Taking this reality as a starting point, this research will attempt to identify the gender bias in hate speech in the political sphere: do female politicians receive more verbal attacks than their male counterparts, not because they are politicians, but because they are women? Do female politicians receive more emotional polarity in the mentions they receive on Twitter than their male counterparts? Through discourse analysis using PLN techniques for emotion detection and text mining on a corpus of 3,483,232 tweets collected from 20 accounts of Spanish politicians, it is found that the messages received by women politicians concentrate more emotional polarity than men’s, but not more hatred, which is slightly higher in men.

With a racially diverse sample of 302 women workers, we tested a moderated mediation model predicting decent work from economic constraints, experiences of sexism, experiences of racism, and the interaction of racism and sexism. Following psychology of working theory (PWT), we positioned work volition and career adaptability as mediators. Main effects were consistent with previous PWT theory and research, indicating that experiences of sexism and racism were important direct and indirect predictors of decent work.

52,"© 2022 by the authors.Background. Invisible violence against women (IVAW) can be understood as the set of attitudes, behaviors, and subtle beliefs that men use to subordinate women and that are culturally accepted. These behaviors can be a risk factor for intimate partner violence (IPV), so it is important to design tools that allow us to detect it early. The aim of this study was to design and psychometrically assess a questionnaire for the detection of invisible violence against women (Q-IVAW). Methodology. A descriptive cross-sectional methodological study carried out in three phases: (1) development of the initial version; (2) pilot study (N = 51); and (3) final validation study (N = 990). The tool’s reliability, validity, and legibility were assessed. To assess reliability, the internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) was analyzed. The validity assessment included an analysis of content, criterion, and construct validity. Results. The EFA revealed that the Q-IVAW was comprised of five factors that explained 55.85% of the total variance found. The Q-IVAW showed very high reliability (α = 0.937), excellent content validity, and good construct validity. The criterion validity analysis showed a moderate correlation between A-IPVAW and Q-IVAW (r = 0.30; p < 0.001). Conclusion. The psychometric assessment of the Q-IVAW yielded good results, which could support the tool’s ability to assess how often women are subjected to inviable violent behaviors by their partners.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,Development and Psychometric Assessment of a Questionnaire for the Detection of Invisible Violence against Women,1,true,10.3390/ijerph191711127,MDPI,52,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,85.0,0.0,,1712248952,Iria Dobarrio-Sanz,2180687990,A.

Whereas several studies have shown that children show bias in the context of many kinds of groups, much less is known about how and when general psychological tendencies and contextual factors contribute to the manifestation of intergroup bias across development, and whether individual differences play a role. In the present study, we pursue these questions by investigating and comparing the developmental trajectories of intergroup bias in 5- to 10-year-old (mostly) White children (n = 100). We assessed children's liking and preferences towards 4 racial groups (White, East Asian, Black, and Middle Eastern) and towards 2 gender groups (male and female) in a within-subject design. We found that the young children in our sample showed a significant racial and gender ingroup bias, speaking to an early and strong manifestation of intergroup bias on the basic ingroup-outgroup distinction. This bias decreased with age. At the same time, we found considerable differences between the different types of outgroups from early on. Furthermore, there were remarkable differences between the developmental trajectories of gender and racial intergroup bias, highlighting the role of both social and contextual influences.

We review the evidence of racial and ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk and care among women and describe a path forward to achieve equitable cardiovascular care for women of racial and ethnic minority groups. Recent Findings: There is a disproportionate effect on cardiovascular outcomes in women and certain racial and ethnic groups in part due to disparities in triage, diagnosis, treatment, which lead to amplification of inequalities in women of minority racial and ethnic background. Data suggest gender and racial bias, underappreciation of nontraditional risk factors, underrepresentation of women in clinical trials and undertreatment of disease contributes to persistent differences in cardiovascular disease outcomes in women of color.

56,"© 2022 Wilderness Medical SocietyIntroduction: Despite near gender parity for women entering medical careers, women remain underrepresented in medical societies. This study evaluated the gender distribution associated with Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) activities. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on the gender breakdown of the following WMS members: a single-day 2020 snapshot, conference attendees 2012 through 2020, conference presenters from winter 2017 through winter 2021, and leadership and awards data from 1984 through 2021. Genderize.io was used to generate probability-based gender categorizations (male/female) based on first names or pronoun associations. Results: Gender was assigned in 91% (4043/4461) of 2020 WMS members, 92% (6179/6720) of 2012-2020 conference attendees, and 100% of remaining categories. Women represented 28% (1143/4043) of members, 27% (1679/6179) of conference attendees, 31% (143/465) of all conference presenters, 20% (62/303) of mainstage presenters, 23% (17/75) of all board members, 38% (14/37) of committee chairs, and 10% (2/20) of board presidents. Women received 18% (42/228) of recognition awards and 31% (15/48) of research grants issued. Conclusions: Although women comprise a minority of WMS participants, gender distribution was similar across categories for membership, conference presenters, total board positions, and research grant awards. Relative underrepresentation was seen in the highest leadership levels, in recognition awards, and in mainstage presenters. Ongoing auditing may help to identify and address sources of bias and/or barriers to participation.

I could never get a faculty job and was often treated like an underling. Nonetheless I persevered to publish highly cited research on several high-profile and sometimes controversial topics. Though overt sexism in science and workplaces has diminished over the course of my career, progress toward eliminating unconscious bias has been slower.

60,"© 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.Background:Only 13.6% of orthopaedic surgeons in Canada are women, even though there is nothing inherent to the practice of orthopaedic surgery that favors men over women. Clearly, there is a need to identify, define, and measure the barriers faced by women in orthopaedic surgery.Methods:An electronic survey was distributed to 330 female-identifying Canadian orthopaedic surgeons and trainees and included the validated Gender Bias Scale (GBS) and questions about career burnout. The barriers for women in Canadian orthopaedics were identified using the GBS. The relationships between the GBS and burnout were investigated. Open-text questions explored the barriers perceived by female orthopaedic surgeons.Results:The survey was completed by 220 female orthopaedic surgeons and trainees (66.7%). Five barriers to gender equity were identified from the GBS: Constrained Communication, Unequal Standards, Male Culture, Lack of Mentoring, and Workplace Harassment. Career burnout correlated with the GBS domains of Male Privilege (r = 0.215; p < 0.01), Disproportionate Constraints (r = 0.152; p < 0.05), and Devaluation (r = 0.166; p < 0.05). Five main themes emerged from the open-text responses, of which 4 linked closely to the barriers identified in the GBS. Work-life integration was also identified qualitatively as a theme, most notably the difficulty of balancing disproportionate parental and childcare responsibilities alongside career aspirations.Conclusions:In this study, 5 barriers to workplace equity for Canadian female orthopaedic surgeons were identified using the validated GBS and substantiated with qualitative assessment using a mixed-methods approach. Awareness of these barriers is a necessary step toward dismantling them and changing the prevailing culture to be fair and equitable for all.Clinical Relevance:A just and equitable orthopaedic profession is imperative to have healthy and thriving surgeons who are able to provide optimal patient care.",2022-08-17,Journal,Article,Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery,12198,2,104,Experiences of Canadian Female Orthopaedic Surgeons in the Workplace: Defining the Barriers to Gender Equity,1,true,10.2106/JBJS.21.01462,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,60,Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

62,"© 2022 by the authors.The phenomenon of adolescent dating violence directed towards women is a widespread social health problem all over the world. Various investigations over time have analysed and studied this problem from different perspectives, taking into account both the aggressors and the victims. However, apart from these perspectives there are other approaches that have been less explored. This study analyses the phenomenon from a cultural point of view. It looks at the way in which variables such as hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and the perception of severity attributed to violent behaviour perpetrated by the aggressor can differ depending on the country of origin of a group of victimized adolescent women, specifically, from Spain and Ecuador. The data analysis, based on the construction of a moderated mediation model, revealed that while hostile sexism seems to be linked to a greater extent with traditional cultures, benevolent sexism is highly relevant in today’s society, and modifies the severity that young female victims attribute to violent behaviour and ultimately affects the frequency of victimization. These results revealed the importance of culture and the way in which violence is perceived in different countries as an essential aspect that must be taken into account to guide the construction of effective prevention programs adapted to the specific target groups of adolescents.",2022-08-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,"Influence of Cross-Cultural Factors about Sexism, Perception of Severity, Victimization, and Gender Violence in Adolescent Dating Relationships",1,true,10.3390/ijerph191610356,MDPI,62,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,96.0,0.0,,1398947095,I.

63,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The Ambivalent Sexism Theory suggests that there are two complementary types of sexism: hostile (subjectively negative attitude towards gender groups) and benevolent (subjectively positive attitude towards gender groups). In this meta-analysis we analysed the relationship between ambivalent sexism and attitudes toward male-to-female violence or violent behaviour. Violence type, the context of violence, respondents’ gender, the countries’ level of gender inequality, and sample type were tested as moderators. The results showed that both hostile and benevolent sexism independently impact on attitudes toward violence and violent behaviour albeit to a different degree. Specifically, the relationship between hostile sexism and attitudes and behaviour is stronger than for the benevolent sexism. The type and context of violence moderate the relationship between hostile sexism and attitudes toward violence and violent behaviour. Only the country's gender inequality levels showed a moderation effect for benevolent sexism.

64,"© 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.Objective: This cross-sectional study characterized associations between sex, role misidentification, and burnout among surgical and nonsurgical residents. Summary Background Data: Limited evidence suggests that female resident physicians are more likely to be misidentified as nonphysician team members, with potential negative implications for wellbeing. The prevalence and impact of role misidentification on the trainee experience in surgical as compared to nonsurgical specialties is unknown. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was distributed to fourteen different residency programs at 2 academic medical centers in August 2018. The survey included questions about demographics, symptoms of burnout, the frequency of misidentification as another member of the care team, and the effect of misidentification on respondentsa' well-being. Results: Two-hundred sixty out of 419 (62.1% response rate) resident physicians completed the survey, of whom 184 (77.3%) reported being misidentified as a nonphysician at least weekly. Female sex was associated with a significantly increased odds of being misidentified at least weekly (adjusted OR 23.7, 95% CI 10.9-51.5; P < 0.001), as was training in a surgical program (adjusted OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.7-8.0; P = 0.001). Frequent role misidentification was associated with burnout (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.5; P = 0.01). In free-text responses, residents reported that being misidentified invoked a sense of not belonging, caused emotional exhaustion, and interfered with patient communication. Conclusions: Role misidentification is more prevalent among female residents and surgical residents, compared to male residents and nonsurgical residents, respectively. Physician role misidentification is associated with burnout and has negative implications for resident wellbeing; interventions to reduce role misidentification are needed.",2022-08-01,Journal,Article,Annals of Surgery,20485,4,276,Sex-Based Role Misidentification and Burnout of Resident Physicians: An Observational Study,0,false,10.1097/SLA.0000000000004599,Wolters Kluwer Health,64,Annals of Surgery,2020.0,23.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Role misidentification is more prevalent among female residents and surgical residents, compared to male residents and nonsurgical residents, respectively, and is associated with burnout and has negative implications for resident wellbeing.'}",50399802,Nina Jain,5114805,Benjamin N.

66,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Adolescent violence, including sexual violence, homophobic name-calling, and teen dating violence, are public health problems that cause harm to many adolescents in the United States. Although research on the perpetration of these forms of adolescent violence has increased in recent years, little is known about perpetration rates across gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. To address this gap, the current study descriptively examined perpetration rates between and across different identities, including self-identified race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and gender identity. In Fall 2017, 9th – 11th grade students (N = 4782) at 20 high schools in Colorado (United States) completed a survey that assessed demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and gender identity) and various forms of violence perpetration. Compared to female adolescents, male adolescents reported significantly higher perpetration rates for: any sexual violence (27% vs. 17%); sexual harassment (26% vs. 15%); unwanted sexual contact (8% vs. 4%); and homophobic name-calling (61% vs. 38%). Differences in perpetration rates were also observed among various racial/ethnic, sexual, and gender minority students compared to non-minority students. This emphasizes a need for more research on how minority stress that results from the dynamics of intersecting identities and societal systems of power–including racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia–contributes to violence perpetration.

67,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: Sex presents a vital determinant of a person’s physiology, anatomy, and development. Recent clinical studies indicate that sex is also involved in the differential manifestation of various diseases, affecting both clinical outcome as well as response to therapy. Genetic and epigenetic changes are implicated in sex bias and regulate disease onset, including the inactivation of the X chromosome as well as sex chromosome aneuploidy. The differential expression of X-linked genes, along with the presence of sex-specific hormones, exhibits a significant impact on immune system function. Several studies have revealed differences between the two sexes in response to infections, including respiratory diseases and COVID-19 infection, autoimmune disorders, liver fibrosis, neuropsychiatric diseases, and cancer susceptibility, which can be explained by sex-biased immune responses. In the present review, we explore the input of genetic and epigenetic interplay in the sex bias underlying disease manifestation and discuss their effects along with sex hormones on disease development and progression, aiming to reveal potential new therapeutic targets.

At present, eight members of the Elovl family (Elovl1–8), displaying a characteristic fatty acid substrate specificity, have been identified in vertebrates, including teleost fish. In general, Elovl1, Elovl3, Elovl6 and Elovl7 exhibit a substrate preference for saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, while Elovl2, Elovl4, Elovl5 and Elovl8 use polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as substrates. PUFA elongases have received considerable attention in aquatic animals due to their involvement in the conversion of C18 PUFAs to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA).

69,"© 2022 The AuthorsHumans quickly detect and gaze at faces in the world, which reflects their importance in cognition and may lead to tuning of face recognition toward the central visual field. Although sometimes reported, foveal selectivity in face processing is debated: brain imaging studies have found evidence for a central field bias specific to faces, but behavioral studies have found little foveal selectivity in face recognition. These conflicting results are difficult to reconcile, but they could arise from stimulus-specific differences. Recent studies, for example, suggest that individual faces vary in the degree to which they require holistic processing. Holistic processing is the perception of faces as a whole rather than as a set of separate features. We hypothesized that the dissociation between behavioral and neuroimaging studies arises because of this stimulus-specific dependence on holistic processing. Specifically, the central bias found in neuroimaging studies may be specific to holistic processing. Here, we tested whether the eccentricity-dependence of face perception is determined by the degree to which faces require holistic processing. We first measured the holistic-ness of individual Mooney faces (two-tone shadow images readily perceived as faces). In a group of independent observers, we then used a gender discrimination task to measured recognition of these Mooney faces as a function of their eccentricity. Face gender was recognized across the visual field, even at substantial eccentricities, replicating prior work. Importantly, however, holistic face gender recognition was relatively tuned—slightly, but reliably stronger in the central visual field. Our results may reconcile the debate on the eccentricity-dependance of face perception and reveal a spatial inhomogeneity specifically in the holistic representations of faces.",2022-08-01,Journal,Article,Vision Research,15165,1,197,Relative tuning of holistic face processing towards the fovea,1,true,10.1016/j.visres.2022.108049,Elsevier Ltd,69,Vision Research,2022.0,110.0,0.0,,1485567754,Teresa Canas-Bajo,143659729,D.

70,"© 2021 The Authors. Journal of Applied Social Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Women are harmed by stereotypes about their fit for positions of authority and changing these stereotypes is not a simple task. As stereotypes have strong epistemic properties, individuals with a high need for cognitive closure (NCC; i.e., the desire for epistemic certainty) can be more likely to accept these stereotypes and, consequently, to prefer men in positions of authority. Consistent with the reactive liberal hypothesis, this effect could be actually more visible among individuals with both a high NCC and left-wing political orientations. We supported these hypotheses in a series of three studies. In Study 1 (N = 217), we found that manipulated NCC predicted preference for men in authority through stereotypes of women as not being fit for authority in a measurement-of-mediation design. In Study 2 (N = 151), we supported this effect in a mediation-as-process design. In Study 3 (N = 391), we found the indirect NCC effect on preference for men in authority was more visible among political liberals. A major implication of this work is that ways of changing the effect of these stereotypes should take into account the NCC, but particularly among individuals with left-wing beliefs.",2022-08-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,15390,4,52,How the mere desire for certainty can lead to a preference for men in authority (particularly among political liberals),1,true,10.1111/jasp.12830,John Wiley and Sons Inc,70,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,2021.0,41.0,0.0,,7600736,Conrad Baldner,3217943,A.

The secondary objective was to evaluate the quality of life and identify associated factors for high-risk OSA in ADHD children. Study design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Material and method: Caregivers of pediatric patients aged 5–18 years old and diagnosed with ADHD by child and adolescent psychiatrists were surveyed about their child's sleeping habits. Results: Two hundred and seventy-four subjects were included. The patients' mean age was 10.4 ± 2.6 years, and 82.8% were males. There were 30 children (10.9%) diagnosed with obesity, 46 (16.8%) with chronic rhinitis, and 9 (3.3%) with asthma. The median duration of ADHD symptoms was 22.1 months. The prevalence of high-risk OSA was 18.2% and was associated with significantly reduced quality of life (adjusted OR = 4.46, 95% CI: 2.26–8.81, P < 0.001).

73,"© 2022 by the authors.Young sexual minority Black men (YSMBM) report widespread instances of Racialized Sexual Discrimination (RSD) when seeking intimate partners online. RSD is associated with negative psychological health outcomes; however, little is known about the differences between virtual environments, and whether users are exposed to differential types/frequencies of RSD across different virtual environments. Using data from a cross-sectional web survey of YSMBM (N = 548), a multivariate Kruskal–Wallis test was conducted comparing those who primarily used Jack’d and those who primarily used Grindr to meet intimate partners; the frequency with which these two groups encountered six RSD domains was compared. Men who primarily used Grindr reported more frequent instances of White superiority and rejection from White men compared with men who primarily used Jack’d. Men who primarily used Jack’d reported more frequent instances of physical objectification from Black men compared with men who primarily used Grindr. RSD may manifest differentially based on the specific venue that YSMBM use. Such differences may reflect the sociodemographic makeup of these spaces, as well as differences in acceptability/normalization of different forms of RSD.

The palm print patterns and blood groups are unique, stable and remain unchanged throughout the life. Hence, the present study was undertaken to investigate association between Palm print patterns and ABO and Rh blood groups in both the genders of the North Indian population. Material and Method: The sample for the cross-sectional study was consist of palmprints from 300 (Male: female 1:1,150 each) medical students of North India. The palmprints of both the hands of the subjects were recorded by the ink and roller method. Result: The distribution of palmprint patterns of both hands showed a high frequency of Category 5, moderate of category 4, small of category 6 & 3 and none of category 1 &2. The study also show gender discrimination as category 5 was more common in males while Category 4 was more common in females (P-value for Right hand is.012 and for Left hand is <.001). Positive correlation was found between palm print patterns and blood group but was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The findings of present study revealed statistically significant sexual dimorphism in the study population.

Results of two cross-sectional studies conducted on representative samples of Poles (Study 1, N = 994 and Study 2, N = 432) indicated that support for an almost total abortion ban was associated with national narcissism – a belief in the national in-group’s greatness that is contingent on its external validation. In both studies, the relationship between national narcissism and support for anti-abortion laws was mediated by hostile, but not benevolent, sexism. Study 2 additionally showed that this effect remained significant even when we accounted for other important variables, such as individual narcissism or prejudice towards people with Down syndrome.

However, little is known about the factors influencing sexual consent attitudes. The current study examined the associations among three sets of factors, known to be associated with sexual assault culture (i.e., hostile and benevolent sexism, token resistance beliefs, and rape myth acceptance), and Chinese men’s sexual consent attitudes, and whether these associations differed depending on their history of binge drinking before sex. Data from 399 Chinese adult men who had sex with women in the past year were analyzed. The results indicated that token resistance beliefs, but not rape myth acceptance, mediated the relationship between hostile sexism and positive sexual consent attitude, an association that was significant in men with and without a history of binge drinking before sex. Benevolent sexism showed a positive significant direct effect on positive sexual consent attitude. Importantly, among men with a history of binge drinking before sex, benevolent sexism had a significant indirect effect on positive sexual consent attitude through token resistance beliefs. Moreover, the supportive direct effect of benevolent sexism on positive sexual consent attitude was also suppressed by a history of binge drinking before sex. These findings suggest that hostile sexism, token resistance beliefs, and binge drinking, may be detrimental to positive sexual consent attitude, and may be important starting points for sexual assault prevention projects in China.",2022-07-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,0,87,Hostile and Benevolent Sexism and Attitudes Toward Establishing Consent Among Chinese Men: The Detrimental Role of Token Resistance Beliefs and Binge Drinking,0,false,10.1007/s11199-022-01298-x,Springer,77,Sex Roles,2022.0,82.0,0.0,,49714278,Xin Shi,2110767415,Yong Zheng,,,,,,,,,9.0,41.0,3.0,102.0,1535.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"© 2022 The AuthorsIn many settler-colonial countries, Indigenous people do not access disability services at rates commensurate with disability prevalence. Existing research suggests that services often do not reflect Indigenous values and social practices, impacting on accessibility. Furthermore, disability services have historically been implicated in processes of colonisation. There is an urgent need to decolonise disability services. Understanding Indigenous knowledge and experience of disability is a necessary step towards achieving this. We systematically reviewed the disability conceptualisations, practices and experiences of First Nations peoples of Australia. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. There was a consensus among these studies that Western constructs of disability do not resonate with many First Nations people across Australia. The studies reported that many First Nations people conceptualise most disabilities as unremarkable conditions that reflect the normal range of human diversity, although some conditions may be associated with social stigma. Inclusive attitudes and practices of caregiving in First Nations families facilitate the participation of First Nations people with disabilities in family and community life. However, ableism and racism in broader society combine to exclude many First Nations peoples with disabilities from public spaces and from labour markets. Disability services regularly fail to reflect First Nations values and social practices, and can lead to further disempowerment and marginalisation due to diagnostic processes; displacement from country and communities; gendered discrimination; and poor relationships with service providers. We argue that intersectional experiences of colonialism, racism, ableism and sexism, particularly in disability services, can lead to the marginalisation of First Nations participants and families. The decolonisation of disability services requires services to embrace diverse First Nations values and practices associated with human capability, social participation and caregiving. Decolonising disability services also necessitates First Nations control of the governance of disability services and reform across service, organisational, systemic and conceptual levels.",2022-07-01,Journal,Review,Social Science and Medicine,18983,2,305,"Towards the decolonisation of disability: A systematic review of disability conceptualisations, practices and experiences of First Nations people of Australia",1,true,10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115047,Elsevier Ltd,78,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2022.0,33.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is argued that intersectional experiences of colonialism, racism, ableism and sexism, particularly in disability services, can lead to the marginalisation of First Nations participants and families.'}",6200292,Stefanie Puszka,101820222,Corinne Walsh,47164390,F.

This article asks whether Kamala Harris’ vice presidential candidacy may have motivated some white voters and especially those scoring high on racial resentment, anti-immigrant attitudes, or sexism to vote for Trump instead of Biden. Methods: We conducted an online priming experiment with non-Hispanic white voters in August 2020, shortly after Harris was announced as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Half of the samples were asked about their support for the president–vice presidential tickets, while the other half were asked only about support for a presidential candidate. Results: Our results show that the Harris’ selection may have affected vote choice by pushing many whites, especially among the most racially conservative whites into the Trump column. We find mixed results for anti-immigrant attitudes and sexism.

80,"Copyright © 2022 The Authors, some rights reserved.Sex bias exists in the development and progression of nonreproductive organ cancers, but the underlying mechanisms are enigmatic. Studies so far have focused largely on sexual dimorphisms in cancer biology and socioeconomic factors. Here, we establish a role for CD8+ T cell–dependent antitumor immunity in mediating sex differences in tumor aggressiveness, which is driven by the gonadal androgen but not sex chromosomes. A male bias exists in the frequency of intratumoral antigen-experienced Tcf7/TCF1+ progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells that are devoid of effector activity as a consequence of intrinsic androgen receptor (AR) function. Mechanistically, we identify a novel sex-specific regulon in progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells and a pertinent contribution from AR as a direct transcriptional transactivator of Tcf7/TCF1. The T cell–intrinsic function of AR in promoting CD8+ T cell exhaustion in vivo was established using multiple approaches including loss-of-function studies with CD8-specific Ar knockout mice. Moreover, ablation of the androgen-AR axis rewires the tumor microenvironment to favor effector T cell differentiation and potentiates the efficacy of anti–PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. Collectively, our findings highlight androgen-mediated promotion of CD8+ T cell dysfunction in cancer and imply broader opportunities for therapeutic development from understanding sex disparities in health and disease.",2022-07-01,Journal,Article,Science Immunology,21100860945,21,7,Androgen conspires with the CD8+ T cell exhaustion program and contributes to sex bias in cancer,2,,10.1126/sciimmunol.abq2630,American Association for the Advancement of Science,80,Science immunology,2022.0,85.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A role is established for CD8+ T cell–dependent antitumor immunity in mediating sex differences in tumor aggressiveness, which is driven by the gonadal androgen but not sex chromosomes, and cell-intrinsic androgen receptor signaling promotes the male-biased susceptibility of CD8+.'}",7570270,H.

81,"© The Author(s) 2020.Background: Victim blame, particularly in cases of acquaintance rape, presents an obstacle to criminal justice. Past research indicates that acquaintance rape results in more blame than stranger rape. However, there are inconsistencies in these findings (e.g., whether there is a linear relationship between victim blame and relationship closeness), partly due to methodological variation. Objectives: To examine the effect of victim–perpetrator relationship on victim blame, how this effect is impacted by rape myth acceptance (RMA) and ambivalent sexism (AS), and to establish what the methodological quality is of studies. Synthesis method: Studies were synthesized through a multilevel meta-analysis using the Metafor package in R (version 2.4-0), synthesizing findings from 47 individual studies. Studies compared victim blame between stranger and acquaintance rape, in isolation or in conjunction with RMA and AS, and were identified through a database search. Results: The review found higher levels of blame in acquaintance as compared to stranger rape, with a medium effect size. This effect was not moderated by RMA. AS was not included as a moderator in the meta-analysis, but the review indicated that benevolent sexism may be a particularly relevant variable. Implications: Future research should examine the relationship between AS and victim blame. The current review contributes to the evidence base on victim blame in rape cases by suggesting that methodological limitations can account for some of the past mixed findings in this area, particularly in a lack of consistency in vignette details.

Surgeons have significant experiences and observations best discovered through qualitative study. The purpose of this study is to identify the similarities and differences between the experiences of men and women surgeons after initiation of mandatory microaggression training. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interviews with female and male surgeons and residents were done following a year-long series of training sessions on the detrimental effects of microaggression. Participants were selected using a convenience sampling method. MAXQDA coding software (Verbi) was used to evaluate interview transcripts with thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen surgeons and surgical residents were interviewed. The participants were of equal gender identification, with the majority being attending surgeons. Multiple themes highlighted similarities and differences between male and female participants. Differences were noted in identification of a sensitive personality, family planning considerations, and experiences of bias. Similarities were related to the personality traits required to be successful in surgery, the sacrifice inherent to a surgical career, and the war rhetoric used to describe the comradery of residency. CONCLUSION: The challenges and rewards of surgery are similar for women and men, but women have additional stressors, including gender-based bias, microaggression, and family planning. These stressors take up energy, decreasing the mental space available for additional roles and affecting the work environment.

The results of the study show that teachers, although they are aware of the existence of gender stereotypes and declare their willingness to counteract them, tend to strengthen rather than eliminate these stereotypes with the strategies and actions undertaken.

Via comparison with symbolism and representative quotes in Hawthorne's 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter, we propose a metaphor to examine how EMRs function as a platform for moral judgment, which may display an indelible ""scarlet letter""for pregnant patients with STI history. We consider whether current depictions of STIs in EMRs are structurally unjust and may contribute to biased treatment by directing attention to violations of hegemonic sex/gender norms regarding sexual behavior and thus triggering moral judgments of maternal fitness.

In Study 1 (N = 568 men), an initial Sex-Based Harassment Inventory (SBHI) was developed with 12 scenarios depicting gender status threats to which respondents rated the likelihood to engage in gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, supportive conduct, and their perceptions of threat.

Gender harassment and unwanted sexual attention intentions loaded on a single, reliable factor, labeled harassment intentions. Two other factors measured threat perceptions and supportive behavior intentions. harassment intentions correlated significantly with threat perceptions, likelihood to sexually harass (Pryor, 1987), hostile and benevolent sexism (Glick & Fiske, 1996), and masculine identification (Glick et al., 2015). In Study 2 (N = 391 men), a non-threat version of the SBHI was compared to the threat version. Threat perceptions mediated the effect of scenario version on harassment intentions, which was stronger at moderate to high levels of hostile sexism and social dominance orientation.

This review will discuss disparities in career advancement and compensation, leadership positions, and recognition in achievement, as well as the mistreatment of women, and challenges related to pregnancy and motherhood. Additionally, this review will provide individuals, hospitals, and societies with actionable advice on how to improve the surgical environment for female surgeons, and work toward gender parity in surgery. Recent Findings: Women comprise a greater proportion of medical students and residents nation-wide. However, the percentage of female surgical residents is not yet proportionate to male surgical residents, and this gap only widens within surgical subspecialties. As academic surgeons, women are promoted within academia at rates slower than men, are less represented in leadership positions than men, and are disproportionately compensated compared to men. Female surgeons regularly encounter gender-based discrimination and mistreatment, which negatively impacts both their careers and psychological well-being. Compared to male surgical residents, female surgical residents have less support, are evaluated differently, are recognized for their achievements more infrequently, and are given less operative autonomy. Female surgeons additionally face a number of challenges with respect to childbearing and motherhood. Summary: Gender-based disparities are pervasive in surgery.

88,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.Background: Pistacia is a genus of dioecious plant species whose trees can take 4–5 years to reach the economically valuable fruit-bearing stage. The fruits have great importance as raw material in the food, healthcare, and baking industries. For that reason, the identification of individual plants in the early juvenile period for the pollination and positioning of trees is crucial for growers. The objective of this study is to develop markers for each Pistacia species that can help in screening the sex of plant seedlings before they reach the reproductive stage, without waiting for morphological characteristics to appear. Methods and results: Within this context, by using the power of the kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assay technology as a marker screening system, we successfully discriminated seven out of eight Pistacia species: P. atlantica, P. integerrima, P. khinjuk, P. mutica, P. terebinthus, P. vera, and P. lentiscus. We used a high-throughput DNA sequence read archive (SRA) to assemble a reference genome that was employed in our studies as a de novo bioinformatics method. Four genomic regions from SRA and three single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions from Kafkas et al. BMC Genomics 16:98, 2015) were selected and sequenced with collected plant material from predominantly the Antepfıstıgı Research Institute Collection Garden, and eight species were aligned intraspecifically for SNP mining. In total, 12 SNP markers were converted to KASP markers, and 5 of them (SNP-PIS-133396, SNP-PIS-167992, P-ATL-91951–565, P-INT-91951–256, P-KHI-91951–115) showed clear allelic discrimination between male and female plants. SNP-PIS-167992 and P-ATL-91951–565 were identified as the best marker assays because they showed allelic frequency differences for all individuals and for both homozygous and heterozygous characters. These markers could be the most comprehensive ones for the whole genus because they showed discriminative power for several species.

89,"© 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Many scholars investigating sexism distinguish between two related, but distinct, forms of sexism aimed at women: hostile sexism and benevolent sexism (Glick & Fiske, 1996). These sexist beliefs can seem contradictory, with hostile sexism (HS) reflecting more contempt for women and benevolent sexism (BS) offering protection and care to women, but both serve to maintain the gender status hierarchy. However, these concepts may have been created based on the white feminine ideal and may not apply to women of color. For example, expectations about female sexual purity may be different across race and may lead to differential treatment of women who violate purity norms. In the current research, participants (N = 410) read a news article about a black or white woman arrested for prostitution, and answered questions about convicting, punishing, and helping the woman. Participants high in HS and high in BS were more likely to convict and punish the sex worker than those low in HS and BS, but HS and BS did not interact with race when predicting conviction and punishment. For helping those high in HS were less likely to recommend immediate interventions and those high in BS were more likely to recommend dependency-oriented interventions, but none of the two-way interactions with sexism and race was significant. It is possible that sex work is such a strong violation of the female purity norm that punishment of women who violate this norm does not vary based on the characteristics of the woman but more intersectional research on race and sexism is needed.",2022-06-01,Journal,Article,Race and Social Problems,19400158571,1,14,Racially Charged: The Impact of Ambivalent Sexism on Black and White Women Arrested for Prostitution,0,false,10.1007/s12552-021-09341-4,Springer,89,Race and Social Problems,2021.0,67.0,0.0,,2129064106,Aliaa Eldabli,5840845,Renae Franiuk,50253063,Jill M.

90,"© 2021, Society for Reproductive Investigation.The gut microbiota, a large ecosystem interacting with the host, has been shown to affect the health and fitness of the host-microbial superorganism. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota communicates with distal organs of the host including the brain, liver, and muscle, as well as testis, through various complex mechanisms. So far, we know that the androgen can markedly remodel the gut microbiota and has initiated an interdisciplinary field termed “microgenderome.” More recently, the gut microbiota has been found as a major regulator of androgen production and metabolism in turn and even could trespass the blood-testis barrier (BTB) to regulate spermatogenesis, which largely updates the current knowledge on male reproduction. In this review, we provided a brief overview of the context of the gender bias of diseases related to gut microbiota, the sex dimorphism of gut microbiota, and their relationships with androgen. We also summarized the known interaction between the testis and gut microbiota based on published animal studies and tentatively discussed the hypothesis of microbiota-gut-testis axis. Finally, we highlighted the opportunities and challenges underlying the ongoing research.

Using the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (AIS; Glick & Fiske, 1996), we examined explicit gender attitudes in 3298 cisgender, transgender, and gender expansive respondents designated female at birth (FAB; n = 1976 cisgender, n = 108 transgender, n = 188 gender expansive) and male at birth (MAB; n = 922 cisgender, n = 52 transgender, n = 52 gender expansive).

MAB; n = 254 cisgender, n = 21 transgender, n = 19 gender expansive) completed the gender-leadership Implicit Association Test (IAT; Dasgupta & Asgari, 2004). Cisgender men scored significantly higher than all other groups on hostile sexism, but patterns of endorsement for benevolent sexism and implicit attitudes were more nuanced, with cisgender women and gender expansive FAB often scoring significantly below other groups. We observed that transgender men and transgender women, along with cisgender men and gender expansive MAB, moderately endorsed essentialist views regarding differences between men and women (i.e., complementary gender differentiation). These data reveal novel patterns of gender-related stereotyping, with some corresponding to sex designated at birth and others corresponding to current gender identification.

92,"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Although the effects of confronting sexism have been examined in the past, no research to date has demonstrated the most common dimensions along which confrontations of workplace sexism differ. Furthermore, previous research has not fully examined how different forms of sexism confrontations differentially impact the workplace experiences of targets experiencing these sexist actions. Thus, these two studies examine how confrontations of workplace sexism commonly differ and the workplace implications of these differences. In Study 1, data were collected from individuals who had witnessed a sexist encounter in the workplace that was subsequently confronted. Using a content analysis approach, we found that the most common differences in confrontations of workplace sexism included the identity of the confronter, the tone of the confrontation, the location of the confrontation, the number of confronters, and the timing of the confrontation. In Studies 2 and 3, we examined how these differences impacted job stress, turnover intentions, perceived organizational support, job satisfaction, and workplace diversity climate of women targets. In Study 2, analysis of survey data from women employees determined that workplace confrontations of workplace sexism of any form are equally beneficial for women targets. Study 3, an experimental vignette study, provided support for the Study 2 findings. This study aids researchers in understanding the dimensionality of sexism confrontations as well as the relationships between these dimensions and important workplace outcomes.

We intend to determine this prevalence on the editorial boards of spine, neurosurgery, and orthopedic journals. Methods: The gender of editorial board members of Medline-indexed spine, neurosurgery, and orthopedic journals was systematically analyzed in 2019, and female representation was compared among these fields. Results: In the 34 journals included (5 spine, 13 neurosurgery, and 16 orthopedic journals), women represented 8.84% (N = 185/2094) of editorial board members. Their representation was 5.53% (N = 30/542) in spine, 8.58% (N = 47/548) in neurosurgery, and 10.77 % (108/1003) in orthopedic journals. Only 5.4% (N = 2/37) of the editors-in- chief were women. The likelihood of having female members was higher in orthopedic than in spine journals (OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.35-3.13; P = 0.001). Neurosurgery journals did not show a significant greater likelihood of having female editorial board members than spine journals (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 0.99-2.57; P = 0.058).

95,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease characterized by prevalence in young women (3:1). Several mechanisms proposed as explanations for gender bias, including skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and dosage or sex hormones, are often involved in the development of autoimmunity. The skewed XCI pattern can lead to an unbalanced expression of some X-linked genes, as observed in several autoimmune disorders characterized by female predominance. No data are yet available regarding XCI and MG. We hypothesize that the preferential XCI pattern may contribute to the female bias observed in the onset of MG, especially among younger women. XCI analysis was performed on blood samples of 284 women between the ages of 20 and 82. XCI was tested using the Human Androgen Receptor Assay (HUMARA). XCI patterns were classified as random (XCI < 75%) and preferential (XCI ≥ 75%). In 121 informative patients, the frequency of skewed XCI patterns was 47%, significantly higher than in healthy controls (17%; p ≤ 0.00001). Interestingly, the phenomenon was observed mainly in younger patients (<45 years; p ≤ 0.00001). Furthermore, considering the XCI pattern and the other clinical characteristics of patients, no significant differences were found.

Here we propose using citation network analysis to characterize the literature topology of a given area. We used the human aggression literature as our example. Our citation network analysis identified 15 research communities on aggression. The five largest communities were: “media and video games”, “stress, traits and aggression”, “rumination and displaced aggression”, “role of testosterone”, and “social aggression”. We examined the growth of these research communities over time, and we used graph theoretic approaches to identify the most influential papers within each community and the “bridging” articles that linked distinct communities to one another. Finally, we also examined whether our citation network analysis would help mitigate gender bias relative to focusing on total citation counts. The percentage of articles with women first authors doubled when identifying influential articles by community structure versus citation count. Our approach of characterizing literature topologies using citation network analysis may provide a valuable resource for psychological scientists by outlining research communities and their growth over time, identifying influential papers within each community (including bridging papers), and providing opportunities to increase gender equity in the field.",2022-04-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,17,Using citation network analysis to enhance scholarship in psychological science: A case study of the human aggression literature,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0266513,Public Library of Science,97,PLoS ONE,2022.0,87.0,0.0,,2163184443,Alessia Iancarelli,2990169,T.

A factor that can potentially influence these reviews is the gender of the physician, because the physician’s gender has been found to influence patient-physician communication. Our study is among the first to conduct a rigorous longitudinal analysis to study the effects of the gender of physicians on their reviews, after accounting for several important clinical factors, including patient risk, physician specialty, and temporal factors, using time fixed effects. In addition, this study is among the first to study the possible gender bias in web-based reviews using statewide data from Alabama, a predominantly rural state with high Medicaid and Medicare use. Objective: This study conducts a longitudinal empirical investigation of the relationship between physician gender and their web-based reviews using data across the state of Alabama, after accounting for patient risk and temporal effects. Methods: We created a unique data set by combining data from web-based physician reviews from the popular physician review website, RateMDs, and clinical data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the state of Alabama. We used longitudinal econometric specifications to conduct an econometric analysis, while controlling for several important clinical and review characteristics across four rating dimensions (helpfulness, knowledge, staff, and punctuality). The overall rating and these four rating dimensions from RateMDs were used as the dependent variables, and physician gender was the key explanatory variable in our panel regression models. Results: The panel used to conduct the main econometric analysis included 1093 physicians. After controlling for several clinical and review factors, the physician random effects specifications showed that male physicians receive better web-based ratings than female physicians. Coefficients and corresponding SEs and P values of the binary variable GenderFemale (1 for female physicians and 0 otherwise) with different rating variables as outcomes were as follows: OverallRating (coefficient –0.194, SE 0.060; P=.001), HelpfulnessRating (coefficient –0.221, SE 0.069; P=.001), KnowledgeRating (coefficient –0.230, SE 0.065; P<.001), StaffRating (coefficient –0.123, SE 0.062; P=.049), and PunctualityRating (coefficient –0.200, SE 0.067; P=.003). The negative coefficients indicate a bias toward male physicians versus female physicians for aforementioned rating variables. Conclusions: This study found that female physicians receive lower web-based ratings than male physicians even after accounting for several clinical characteristics associated with the physicians and temporal effects. Although the magnitude of the coefficients of GenderFemale was relatively small, they were statistically significant.

102,"© 2022 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and ResearchObjective: To evaluate whether providing resident physicians with “DOCTOR” role identification badges would impact perceptions of bias in the workforce and alter misidentification rates. Participants and Methods: Between October 2019 and December 2019, we surveyed 341 resident physicians in the anesthesiology, dermatology, internal medicine, neurologic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, and urology departments at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, before and after an 8-week intervention of providing “DOCTOR” role identification badges. Differences between paired preintervention and postintervention survey answers were measured, with a focus on the frequency of experiencing perceived bias and role misidentification (significance level, α=.01). Free-text comments were also compared. Results: Of the 159 residents who returned both the before and after surveys (survey response rate, 46.6% [159 of 341]), 128 (80.5%) wore the “DOCTOR” badge. After the intervention, residents who wore the badges were statistically significantly less likely to report role misidentification at least once a week from patients, nonphysician team members, and other physicians (50.8% [65] preintervention vs 10.2% [13] postintervention; 35.9% [46] vs 8.6% [11]; 18.0% [23] vs 3.9% [5], respectively; all P<.001). The 66 female residents reported statistically significantly fewer episodes of gender bias (65.2% [43] vs 31.8% [21]; P<.001). The 13 residents who identified as underrepresented in medicine reported statistically significantly less misidentification from patients (84.6% [11] vs 23.1% [3]; P=.008); although not a statistically significant difference, the 13 residents identifying as underrepresented in medicine also reported less misidentification with nonphysician team members (46.2% [6] vs 15.4% [2]; P=.13).

103,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous group of tumors characterized by an incidence of 650,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths per year worldwide and a male to female ratio of 3:1. The main risk factors are alcohol and tobacco consumption and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. HNSCC cases are divided into two subgroups, the HPV-negative (HPV−) and the HPV-positive (HPV+) which have different clinicopathological and molecular profiles. However, patients are still treated with the same therapeutic regimens. It is thus of utmost importance to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences to find new biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets towards personalized therapies. Epigenetic alterations are a hallmark of cancer and can be exploited as both promising biomarkers and potential new targets. E6 and E7 HPV oncoviral proteins besides targeting p53 and pRb, impair the expression and the activity of several epigenetic regulators. While alterations in DNA methylation patterns have been well described in HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC, accurate histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) characterization is still missing. Herein, we aim to provide an updated overview on the impact of HPV on the hPTMs landscape in HNSCC.

The affective-discursive analysis of online commentaries resulted in the identification of four affective-discursive practices: an immoral woman, incompetent woman, calculating woman and inferior woman. Misogynist discourse related to the PM Marin took the form of a moral act, drew from stereotypical images of women as less rational than men, appeared as accusations targeted at Marin for playing the gender card as a political tactic, and constructed an image of Marin and female politicians as objects of men's sexual desires and as inferior to men. These affective-discursive practices mobilized dehumanizing discourse ranging from milder forms of derogation, scorn and other-condemning practices to harsher forms of belittlement, humiliation and animalistic dehumanization.

105,"© 2022 International Society for Sexual MedicineBackground: Preliminary evidence indicates that acute and chronic psychological stress affect sexual arousal and satisfaction. African American women, in particular, are vulnerable to the impacts of gender- and race-related stress, given their socially constructed identities as African Americans and as women. Aim: We examined associations between minority stress and sexual function using data from 248 African American women. Methods: Surveys were conducted with 248 African American women in South LA with male partners at risk for acquiring HIV. We analyzed self-reports on (i) stress indicators: chronic burden, perceived racism/sexism, and histories of trauma/sexual abuse; (ii) Female Sexual Function Index domains: desire, arousal, and satisfaction; and (iii) potential moderators: social support and spirituality. We used multiple regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors, to examine the relationships between stress indictors, potential moderators, and sexual function domains. Outcomes: The outcomes were the female sexual function index domains of desire, arousal, and satisfaction. Results: This largely low-income sample experienced significant chronic and acute stressors, was highly spiritual and reported strong social support. Moderate-high chronic burden and increasing sexism scores were independently associated with decreased arousal (B = -0.38, 95%CI = -0.75, -0.02) and satisfaction (B = -0.03, 95%CI = -0.06, 0.00) scores, respectively. Clinical Implications: Providers may want to explore chronic burden in patients who complain about low sexual arousal. Additionally, to develop effective HIV- and other STI-related interventions that impact behaviors that can confer sexual risk, prevention strategies are needed that either reduce contextual stressors or mitigate their impact. Strengths: Strengths of this research are that it focuses on sexual function among previously under-studied, low-income African American women and that it takes into account the unique set of stressors faced by these women. Limitations: A limitation is that the sample size may have been too small to capture the effects of potential moderators. Conclusions: Low-income African American women accumulate life stressors that may harm sexual function. Schrode K, Poareo E, Li M, et al.

106,"© 2022 The AuthorsNeurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by relatively early onset, with temporal variations across conditions. These lifelong conditions lead to social and communication impairments, and cognitive deficits. In recent years, the importance of biological sex as a vital factor determining behavioural and cognitive vulnerability has been substantiated with a direct impact on both diagnosis and therapeutic response. Several theories have been raised as an attempt to explain psychiatric sex bias. These include the extreme male brain theory, female protective effect, maternal stress, and perinatal inflammation. Here, we address this issue in the context of three important neurodevelopmental disorders where male bias exists into variable extents: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Sex differences in behaviour and brain organization are reviewed both for patient and animal research, in the context of molecular theories that may explain differential disease vulnerability.

107,"© 2021 International Society for Sexual MedicineIntroduction: A clear and well-documented gender bias exists in the evaluation of sexual outcomes for women undergoing urologic surgery. Due to the anatomic template of anterior exenteration, women are commonly left with side effects that include sexual dysfunction and the perpetuated effects of surgical menopause. Objectives: To present evaluation and treatment recommendations for female sexual dysfunction treatment and evaluation, in addition to surgical templates during radical cystectomy (RC). Methods: This article reviews current literature regarding sexual function and RC with urinary diversion in female bladder cancer patients. Furthermore, this review will provide a review of techniques for organ and neurovascular preservation, along with novel vaginal reconstruction templates. Our review will further focus on emerging technology, including minimally invasive surgery and organ and nerve preservation, directed at preservation of female sexual function. Results: Clinically, studies have demonstrated that females who have undergone genitalia-sparing and neurovascular preservation during RC regained sexual activity earlier than patients undergoing traditional RC. If organ and nerve preservation is not feasible due to involvement of trigone or bladder neck, vaginal reconstruction can mitigate the sexual dysfunction that results from a loss of the anterior vagina during a standard RC. Conclusion: Female sexual dysfunction is associated with high levels of patient distress and is best comanaged with a multidisciplinary treatment approach, including preoperative counseling, intraoperative nerve, and organ preservation, and postoperative interventions to mitigate sexual side effects.

108,"© 2021, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune disease with significant gender bias in women, and sex hormones are considered to play an important role in the regulation of immune activity. The CD45 isoforms generated through alternative splicing of mRNA identify different functional status of lymphocytes and also are suggested as a biomarker for assessing the progression of SLE, while the modulation of CD45 expression in SLE patients is not clear. Methods: In this study, the peripheral blood sera of 46 SLE patients and 15 health individuals were collected for detecting the levels of sex hormones and immune associated factors. The expression of CD45 isoforms and the status of CD45 DNA methylation of the peripheral mononuclear blood cells were detected by flow cytometry and bisulfite sequencing PCR, respectively. Results: The levels of complement C3 and IgA decreased, especially decline of the serum IgA to the level of selective immunoglobulin A deficiency, and the C-reactive protein increased in SLE patients when compared with healthy controls, which manifested the abnormal immune activity of the SLE patients. Sex hormones detection showed a decreased testosterone and increased prolactin in SLE. An accelerated expression of CD45RO, reduced CD45RA and CD45RB, and a relative hypermethylation of CD45 DNA in SLE were also identified that provided a clue to explain the possible regulatory mechanism for the immune function in SLE. Conclusion: The results indicated that the aberrant CD45 isoforms, DNA methylation and hormone levels might be correlated with the imbalanced immune activity of SLE patients.Key Points• Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency was significantly higher in SLE than in healthy individuals.• SLE patients had decreased testosterone and increased prolactin in the sera.• An aberrant expression of CD45 isoforms and CD45 DNA methylation were identified in SLE.",2022-04-01,Journal,Article,Clinical Rheumatology,19187,2,41,The aberrant expression of CD45 isoforms and levels of sex hormones in systemic lupus erythematosus,0,false,10.1007/s10067-021-05934-x,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,108,Clinical Rheumatology,2022.0,51.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results indicated that the aberrant CD45 isoforms, DNA methylation and hormone levels might be correlated with the imbalanced immune activity of SLE patients.'}",48557089,Zhaoxia Dong,2116044067,Bin-mei Zhang,47215926,J.

109,"© 2021 International Society for Sexual MedicineBackground: Lesbophobia and biphobia are manifestations of homophobic violence directed at lesbian and bisexual women that results in daily violation of rights and social exclusion. Aim: To describe experiences of the violence against lesbian and bisexual women in Brazil. Methods: Sequential mixed methods study was carried out in 2 stages. In the first one, quantitative, an electronic questionnaire was applied to women from all regions, with questions about sociodemographic characteristics, self-identification and lesbophobic and biphobic events. In the second one, qualitative, lesbian, and bisexual women were interviewed face to face about the violence suffered. Outcomes: The chi-square test was applied to compare violence against lesbian and bisexual women (type of violence, place of aggression, gender and age range of the aggressor, bond with the aggressor, repetition of violence, and denunciation of violence) and the content analysis for qualitative data (main categories of analysis were events of violence, denunciation, and consequences of violence). Results: The report of violence was present in 65% of the answers. There was a predominance of psychological violence (39.8%), in the public environment (63%), practiced by men (73.2%), by strangers (66.2%) and repeatedly (82%). Lesbian women, compared to bisexuals, were more prone to violence in the public environment (59.5% vs 39.5%) and with repetition (84.3% vs 60.6%). The narratives explained intimidating experiences in the family environment (insults, threat of suicide or homicide and false imprisonment) and public (harassment, beatings, and rape). Discriminatory attitudes, insults, and refusal of service in restaurants and bars were recurrent. Clinical Implications: The data provide information that can serve to improve policy initiatives to reduce these episodes. Strengths and Limitations: This is the first study of mixed methods, with national coverage, on lesbophobia and biphobia events in Brazil. Future studies should include women underrepresented in this research as trans women, non-white, less educated, and from the most distant regions of the country.

110,"© International Headache Society 2021.Background: The economic burden of headache in European countries is substantial, mostly related to indirect work-productivity loss costs, yet data for Portugal is scarce. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey of headache was distributed to a convenience sample of Portuguese companies’ workforces, to assess last-year headache and “yesterday”-point prevalence. Preexisting headaches were classified into migraine and non-migraine headache and work impact (absenteeism and presenteeism) was evaluated in relation to point prevalence. If no significant selection biases were detected, projected work-loss costs for the whole country were to be calculated. Results: Eleven (17%) of 65 invited companies participated, around 15,000 active workers were exposed to the survey and 3624 (24.3%) responded, 73% females, 84.3% with previous (“last-year”) headaches, 53% with migraine. Due to participation and gender bias, national cost-projections were not calculated. Workday point-prevalence was 21% (migraine) and 9% (non-migraine headache), resulting in 14 employees with migraine losing, on average, 4 h and 32 min of work time. Presenteeism occurred in 29% of migraine and 15% of NMH employees. Yearly cost of each employee with a headache disorder was €664.88.

Second, participants drew on discourses of sexism, genderism, and transphobia to illustrate the complexity of constructing counter-normative masculine subject positions. Finally, while trans masculine individuals discursively positioned their masculinities as caring, their constructions of masculinity simultaneously contained complicity with dominant discourses about hegemonic masculinity.

The goal of the present study was to explore the effects of intersected discrimination and discrimination types on COVID-19, mental health, and cognition. A sample of 542 Iraqis, 55.7% females, age ranged from 18 to 73, with (M = 31.16, SD = 9.77). 48.7% were Muslims, and 51.3% were Christians (N = 278). We used measures for COVID-19 stressors, executive functions, intersected discrimination (gender discrimination, social groups-based discrimination, sexual orientation discrimination, and genocidal discrimination), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, status and death, existential anxieties, and health. We conducted independent samples t test between Muslims and Christians. We conducted hierarchical regression analyses using the Christian minority subsample to see if intersected discrimination is predictive of COVID-19 hospitalization. We conducted two-path analyses, one with intersected discrimination as an independent variable and the second with the different discrimination types as independent variables. Intersected discrimination predicted COVID-19 hospitalization. The primary discrimination type for Christians was genocidal discrimination. Christians had higher existential anxiety about status and death than Muslims. Intersected discrimination and discrimination types had a significant association with mental health, health, and cognition variables, with intersected discrimination, had a higher impact than each. Existential anxiety about the person’s social and economic status was the critical outcome of intersected discrimination that trickles down to other variables.

114,"Copyright © 2022 the authorsConsistent with current models of embodied emotions, this study investigates whether the somatosensory system shows reduced sensitivity to facial emotional expressions in autistic compared with neurotypical individuals, and whether these differences are independent from between-group differences in visual processing of facial stimuli. To investigate the dynamics of somatosensory activity over and above visual carryover effects, we recorded EEG activity from two groups of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or typically developing (TD) humans (male and female), while they were performing a facial emotion discrimination task and a control gender task. To probe the state of the somatosensory system during face processing, in 50% of trials we evoked somatosensory activity by delivering task-irrelevant tactile taps on participants’ index finger, 105 ms after visual stimulus onset. Importantly, we isolated somatosensory from concurrent visual activity by subtracting visual responses from activity evoked by somatosensory and visual stimuli. Results revealed significant task-dependent group differences in mid-latency components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). ASD participants showed a selective reduction of SEP amplitudes (P100) compared with TD during emotion task; and TD, but not ASD, showed increased somatosensory responses during emotion compared with gender discrimination. Interestingly, autistic traits, but not alexithymia, significantly predicted SEP amplitudes evoked during emotion, but not gender, task. Importantly, we did not observe the same pattern of group differences in visual responses.

Androcentric bias emerges whereby research by men and/or dominated by men is perceived as higher quality and gains more attention. We examined if these androcentric biases materialize within fields that study bias (psychology). How do individuals in close contact with psychology view psychology research outlets (i.e., journals) with titles including the words women, gender, sex, or feminism (sex/gender-related) or contain the words men or masculinity (men-related; Study 1) versus psychology journals that publish other-specialized research, and do these perceptions differ in the general public? While the men-related journal was less meritorious than its other-specialty journal, evidence emerged supporting androcentric bias such that the men-related journal was more favorable than the other sex/gender-related journals (Study 1). Further, undergraduate men taking psychology classes rated sex/gender-related versus other-specialty journals as less favorable, were less likely to recommend subscription (Studies 1–2), and rated the journals as lower quality (Study 2 only). Low endorsement of feminist ideology was associated with less support for sex/gender-related journals versus matched other-specialty journals (Studies 1–2). Decreased subscription recommendations for sex/gender-related journals (and the men-related journal) were mediated by decreased favorability and quality beliefs, especially for men (for the sex/gender-related journals) and those low in feminist ideology (Studies 1–2). However, we found possible androcentric-interest within the public sphere.

Among women living with HIV, there is a dearth of longitudinal information regarding dynamics of sex work engagement and associated social and health outcomes. In order to better understand the social contexts and health needs of sex working women living with HIV, this study aimed to understand recent sex work prevalence and its longitudinal associations with stigma, psychosocial and clinical HIV outcomes among women living with HIV in Canada. Methods: We conducted a three-wave prospective cohort survey at 18-month intervals with women living with HIV aged 16 and older in three Canadian provinces between 2013 and 2018. We used generalized estimating equations to examine longitudinal associations between recent (past 6-month) sex work with three types of outcomes: psychosocial (recent violence, recent injection drug use, hazardous alcohol use, clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder), clinical HIV (CD4 count and viral load) and stigma (HIV-related stigma, racial discrimination and gender discrimination). Equations were adjusted for socio-demographic factors associated with sex work across all three waves: province, age, income, gender identity, sexual orientation, education level, ethnicity and housing security. Results and Discussion: Of 1422 participants, 129 (9.1%) reported recent sex work during at least one wave (82 at baseline, 73 at first follow-up and 32 at second follow-up). In adjusted analyses, recent sex work was associated with psychosocial outcomes, including: past 3-month violence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.70, 3.60), past 6-month injection drug use (AOR = 3.49, 95% CI = 2.21–5.52), hazardous alcohol use (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.04–3.89) and depression (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.06–2.15). In unadjusted analyses, sex work was also associated with clinical HIV outcomes and gender discrimination, but not racial discrimination/HIV-related stigma. Conclusions: Among women living with HIV in Canada, sex work engagement is dynamic, and sex workers are more likely to report recent violence, recent injection drug use, problematic alcohol use and clinical depression. Violence prevention and support, harm reduction, mental health promotion and sex work-affirming programs could be employed to optimize health and rights for sex working women living with HIV.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of the International AIDS Society,19700175037,0,25,Recent sex work and associations with psychosocial outcomes among women living with HIV: findings from a longitudinal Canadian cohort study,1,true,10.1002/jia2.25874,John Wiley and Sons Inc,117,Journal of the International AIDS Society,2022.0,53.0,0.0,,3884508,C.

118,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBone anthropometric indices have a crucial role in sex estimation in forensic medicine. Although the pelvis and the skull are the most valuable bones in this regard, they may not always be available. The present study aimed to estimate the sex using the anthropometric measurements of hand phalanges in the living Iranian Population. In this population-based study, the anthropometric parameters of the right-hand phalanges were measured on X-ray images of 208 Iranian males and females aged 25 to 70 years. Discriminating function analysis was used to estimate the sex and obtain its formula. Comparison of these variables through t-test showed that all measurements were significantly higher in males than females (p < 0.001). By entering all three measures of the maximum length, proximal width, and distal width of the phalanx in the analysis model, the sex estimation diagnostic accuracy was 74.5 - 80.8% for proximal phalanges, 72.1-80.8% for distal phalanges, and 76.0-80.8% for middle phalanges. In the stepwise diagnostic analysis model, the diagnostic accuracy was 81.7 – 83.2% for the right fingers. According to the results of this study, measuring the phalanx dimensions using X-ray images cannot be a very accurate method for estimating sex. Due to the limited number of studies in this field, further research can be conducted to obtain more comprehensive, highly sensitive sex discrimination equations using hand bone dimensions for different populations.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Forensic Imaging,21100976731,0,28,Sex determination using hand phalanges: X-ray study on Iranian population,0,false,10.1016/j.fri.2022.200494,Elsevier Ltd,118,Forensic Imaging,2022.0,24.0,0.0,,2120503395,Arezoo Habibi Rad,2061520567,S.

Current LA PrEP modalities in clinical trials include injections, films, rings, and implants; LA ART modalities in trials include subcutaneous injections and long-term oral pills. Although LA modalities hold incredible promise, global availability is inhibited by long-standing multilevel perils including declining multilateral funding, patent protections and lack of political will. Once available, access and uptake are limited by factors such as insurance coverage, clinic access, labor markets, stigma, and structural racism and sexism. These must be addressed to facilitate equitable access for all.SummaryThere have been tremendous recent advances in the efficacy of LA ART and PrEP modalities, providing renewed hope that 'ending the HIV epidemic' is within reach. However, pervasive socio-structural inequities limit the promise of LA modalities, highlighting the need for cautious optimism in light of the embedded inequities in the trajectory of research, development, and population-level implementation.",2022-03-01,Journal,Review,Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS,6300153105,2,17,"Promise, perils and cautious optimism: The next frontier in long-acting modalities for the treatment and prevention of HIV",1,true,10.1097/COH.0000000000000723,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,121,Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS,2022.0,135.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'There have been tremendous recent advances in the efficacy of LA ART and PrEP modalities, providing renewed hope that ‘ending the HIV epidemic’ is within reach, but pervasive socio-structural inequities limit the promise of LA modalities.'}",3961039,M.

We found that observers judge a sexist perpetrator as less sexist if he is rude toward men. This occurs because rudeness toward men creates the illusion of gender blindness. We documented this phenomenon in five preregistered studies consisting of online adult participants and adult students from professional schools (total N = 4,663). These attributions are problematic because sexism and rudeness are not mutually exclusive. Men who hold sexist beliefs about women can be—and often are—rude toward other men.

124,"© 2021 The Author(s).Objective: To analyze gender bias in clinical trials, to design an algorithm that mitigates the effects of biases of gender representation on natural-language (NLP) systems trained on text drawn from clinical trials, and to evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: We analyze gender bias in clinical trials described by 16 772 PubMed abstracts (2008-2018). We present a method to augment word embeddings, the core building block of NLP-centric representations, by weighting abstracts by the number of women participants in the trial. We evaluate the resulting gender-sensitive embeddings performance on several clinical prediction tasks: comorbidity classification, hospital length of stay prediction, and intensive care unit (ICU) readmission prediction. Results: For female patients, the gender-sensitive model area under the receiver-operator characteristic (AUROC) is 0.86 versus the baseline of 0.81 for comorbidity classification, mean absolute error 4.59 versus the baseline of 4.66 for length of stay prediction, and AUROC 0.69 versus 0.67 for ICU readmission. All results are statistically significant. Discussion: Women have been underrepresented in clinical trials. Thus, using the broad clinical trials literature as training data for statistical language models could result in biased models, with deficits in knowledge about women. The method presented enables gender-sensitive use of publications as training data for word embeddings. In experiments, the gender-sensitive embeddings show better performance than baseline embeddings for the clinical tasks studied. The results highlight opportunities for recognizing and addressing gender and other representational biases in the clinical trials literature.

125,"© The Author(s) 2022.Racial differences in benevolent sexism have been underexplored. To address this gap, we used standpoint theory as a framework to examine race-gender group differences in the endorsement of benevolent sexism and how cultural factors (i.e., egalitarianism, religiosity, and racial identity) and inequality factors (i.e., experiences with racial discrimination and support for social hierarchies) might mediate this relationship. Among 510 Black and white undergraduate women and men, we found racial differences, such that Black women and men had higher endorsement of benevolent sexism than white women and men. Further, there was a gender difference for only white participants, with white men endorsing these attitudes more than white women. For Black women, religiosity and racial identity mediated the relationship between their race-gender group and greater benevolent sexism compared to white women, but only religiosity mediated the relationship for Black men. Neither inequality mediator accounted for benevolent sexism differences; however, both were associated with white women’s lower benevolent sexism, as was egalitarianism. Given these findings, we discuss implications for benevolent sexism theory, the possibility that cultural factors may shape Black women and men’s standpoint by establishing group-based norms and expectations around benevolently sexist behavior, and suggest culturally appropriate methods to reduce sexism.

For girls, however, the perceived stability of the gender hierarchy moderated the effect of modern sexism. In an experiment (Study 2, N = 704), hierarchical regression analyses showed that in the case of gay people, modern sexism predicted boys’ preferred gendered behavior well. While, in the case of bisexual people, modern sexism (along with fear of backlash) predicted preferences for both boys’ and girls’ gendered behavior depending on the stability of the gender hierarchy.

The present study (N = 89, ages 7–11; predominately Hispanic, White, and multi-racial children) examined the generalizability of this phenomenon across middle childhood and the mechanisms underlying variability in its development. Replicating prior work, children were slower and less accurate to categorize the gender of Black women compared to Asian or White women, as well as compared to Black men, suggesting that children perceived Black women as less representative of their gender. These effects were robust across age within a racially and ethnically diverse sample of children. Children's tendencies to view their own racial identities as expansive and flexible, however, attenuated these effects: Children with more flexible racial identities also had gender concepts that were more inclusive of Black women. In contrast, the tendency for race to bias children's gender representations was unrelated to children's multiple classification skill and racial essentialism. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying variation in how race biases gender across development, with critical implications for how children's own identities shape the development of intergroup cognition and behavior.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Developmental Science,13503,3,25,Who is a typical woman?

Such information could be important for informing longitudinal epidemiologic studies of discrimination and health. We characterized trends in self-reports of racial, socioeconomic status, and gender discrimination over time measured using the Experiences of Discrimination Scale, with a focus on whether individuals' reports of lifetime discrimination were consistent over time. Overall experiences of discrimination and the number of settings in which discrimination was reported in 1992, 2000, and 2010 were examined among 2,774 African-American and White adults in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Reports of ""ever""experiencing discrimination decreased for all forms of discrimination across the 3 study visits. Approximately one-third (30%-41%) of the sample inconsistently reported ever experiencing any discrimination over time, which contributed to the observed decreases. Depending on the form of discrimination, inconsistent reporting patterns over time were more common among African-American, younger, less educated, and lower-income individuals and women-groups who are often most exposed to and severely impacted by the health effects of discrimination.

131,"© The Author(s) 2020.With growing attention to adjudication of campus sexual assault cases, more is known regarding students’ views of sexual assault, but little the literature focuses on how students perceive “justice” in terms of assigning sanctions or guilt/responsibility for such cases. The present study focused on understanding whether college students’ preformed attitudes and beliefs were associated with the severity of sanctions they applied across a range of sexual assault cases as well as their assignments of guilt and responsibility to the parties involved. To determine students’ attitudes and beliefs mediating effects on sanction choices, five scales (i.e., rape myth acceptance, downplaying the severity of rape, sexism, just world beliefs, and right-wing authoritarianism) were adapted and used for this project. College students (n = 846) responded to one of four versions of a randomly distributed survey each containing eight vignettes varied to represent levels of 14 factors employed because of their relevance to campus sexual assault cases. Across all versions, sexism was associated with increased responsibility given to the victim. In addition, stronger endorsement of both downplaying significance of rape and rape myth acceptance scales were associated with giving a milder sanction to the perpetrator and increased responsibility and guilt assigned to the victim. Just world beliefs and right-wing authoritarianism associations were inconsistent across the four versions, suggesting these beliefs were situation-specific. Preformed attitudes that are more directly related to the context of sexual assault influenced the designation of sanctions applied to perpetrators and perceptions of guilt and responsibility.

132,"© 2022 American Psychological AssociationOne tacit assumption in social psychology is that people learn gender stereotypes from their environments. Yet, little research has examined how such learning might occur: What are the features of social environments that shape people’s gender stereotypes? We propose that nonverbal patterns communicate intersubjective gender norms (i.e., what behaviors people value in women and girls vs. men and boys). Furthermore, we propose that children develop intersubjective gender norms in part because they are commonly and consistently exposed to these nonverbal patterns. Across three studies, we tested the hypotheses that (a) children are frequently exposed to a nonverbal pattern of gender-role bias in which people respond more positively to gender-stereotypical than counterstereotypical girls and boys and (b) emotionally perceptive girls extract meaning from this pattern about what behaviors others value in girls (traditionally feminine behavior) and boys (traditionally masculine behavior). Study 1 indicated that characters across 12 popular U.S. children’s TV programs exhibited a small, but consistent nonverbal bias favoring gender-stereotypical TV characters. In Study 2, girls (N = 68; 6–10 years) felt more pressure to be feminine after viewing TV clips that included traditional nonverbal bias than after viewing clips that reversed this bias. As predicted, these results held only to the extent that children could accurately decode nonverbal emotion (i.e., were emotionally perceptive). Study 3 replicated these results (N = 91; 6–11 years).",2022-02-21,Journal,Article,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,30039,1,123,The Transmission of Gender Stereotypes Through Televised Patterns of Nonverbal Bias,0,false,10.1037/pspi0000390,American Psychological Association,132,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,23592180,S.

This quantitative study aimed to examine: (1) the relationships of individual factors (gender, age, education level, sexual orientation, and age of identification of sexual orientation) and perceived family support with ISS; and (2) the associations of ISS with mood problems and the moderating effects of gender on the associations among Taiwanese young adult lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. In total, 500 male and 500 female young adult LGB individuals aged between 20 and 30 years participated in this study. The experience of ISS, individual (e.g., gender, age, education level, sexual orientation, and age of identification of sexual orientation) and environmental factors (perceived family), mood problems (e.g., anxiety and depression) were collected. The individual and environmental factors related to ISS and the associations of ISS with mood problems were examined using multivariate linear regression analysis. The results indicated that gender, sexual orientation, age of identification of sexual orientation, and perceived family support were significantly associated with all or some dimensions of ISS in LGB individuals. Various dimensions of ISS had different relationships with anxiety and depression. Gender had moderating effects on the association between the identity dimension of ISS and sexual orientation as well as between the social discomfort dimension of ISS and anxiety.

135,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The literature on online gaming has generally focused on male gamers and has been dominated by negative aspects of gaming. The present study addresses the gender gap in this field by exploring experiences of female gamers further by unravelling several positive experiences alongside some potentially harmful tendencies connected to gaming, including female gamers’ wishes and ambitions for their future gaming. A total of 20 female adult gamers across Europe were interviewed and results were analysed using thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: (i) to be or not to be a (female) gamer; (ii) improving social skills and levelling up on mental health; (iii) not always a healthy escape; and (iv) there is more to explore. The present study is one of few empirical studies regarding the construction of self-image, and experiences of female gamers. It has showed participants have a history as gamers from adolescence, but still face problems derived from the stigmatised internal gender self-image. Externally, female gamer stigmatisation may result in sexism, gender violence, harassment, and objectification. Additionally, females may decide against identifying as gamers, engaging in social gaming interaction, or hold back from online gaming in general, thereby missing out on the opportunities for recreation as well as social and psychological benefits that gaming brings. There is, therefore, urgent need for more research and actions to promote change, equity, education, and security for female gamers as well as their male counterparts.

We show that such tweets arise disproportionately within places where mating competition among men is likely to be high because of male-biased sex ratios, few single women, high income inequality, and small gender gaps in income.

137,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdDiscrimination has been associated with adverse health behaviors and outcomes, including substance use. Higher rates of substance use are reported among some marginalized groups, such as lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations, and have been partially attributed to discrimination. This study uses 2015–2019 National College Health Assessment data to determine whether college students reporting discrimination due to sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, gender, or age report greater substance use than their peers who do not report such experiences. Additionally, we assess exploratory questions regarding whether substance choices differ among students who reported facing discrimination. Over time, about 8.0% of students reported experiencing discrimination in the past year. After applying inverse probability treatment weights (IPTWs), exposure to discrimination was associated with an excess of 44 cases of marijuana use per 1000 students, an excess of 39 cases of alcohol use per 1000 students, and an excess of 11 cases of prescription painkiller use per 1000 students. Multivariable logistic regression models with IPTW demonstrated that students who experienced discrimination were more than twice as likely to use inhalants and methamphetamine. These students were also significantly more likely to use other drugs, including opiates, non-prescribed painkillers, marijuana, alcohol, hallucinogens, cocaine, and cigarettes; however, the differences with peers were smaller in magnitude. Students who experienced discrimination did not differ from peers who reported non-prescribed antidepressants use and were significantly less likely to use e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.

138,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Exposure to urban greenspaces promotes a variety of mental health benefits. However, much of the evidence for these benefits is biased towards high-income countries. In contrast, urban areas in low-income settings that have the highest rates of urbanisation remain understudied. Given the increasing burden of mental ill-health associated with urbanisation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a clear need to better understand the role urban greenspaces play in mitigating mental ill-health. Here we use a novel combination of research methods (participatory video, focus groups and the Q-methodology) in a rapidly urbanising low-income city (Kathmandu, Nepal). We explored residents' perspectives on ecosystem services, and the pathways linking greenspaces to mental health. Residents indicated that greenspaces are linked to mental health through pathways such as reducing harm (exposure to air pollution and heat), restoring capacities (attention restoration and stress reduction), building capacities (encouraging physical activity, fostering social cohesion and child development) and causing harm (human – wildlife conflicts, gender discrimination). It is likely that a combination of such pathways triggers mental health impacts. Of all ecosystem services, cultural services such as providing settings for recreation, or intellectual or mental interactions with greenspaces involving analytical, symbolic, spiritual or religious activities were most preferred. Our findings emphasise that cultural ecosystem services provide a fundamental basic need which all people, including low-income residents, depend on to participate meaningfully in society. Urban greenspaces therefore play a pivotal role in reducing the burden of mental ill-health for low-income residents in LMICs.

A secondary objective was to examine the gender composition of middle authors in relation to the genders of their respective first and last authors. Methods: In this observational study, we selected 4 journals in emergency medicine using the Journal of Citation Reports and prior literature to analyze genders of all authors from research articles and editorials published from January 2013 to September 2019. Reviewers identified author genders through web searches with matching academic qualifications or used a gender identification application programming interface to identify likelihood of male or female identity. The primary outcome was the proportion of female authors in each position. Results: Selected publications included 2,980 original research articles with 18,224 authors (median 6, interquartile range [IQR] 4 to 8) and 433 editorials with 986 authors (median 2, IQR 1 to 2).

We sought to better understand how speakers would like to be introduced, and if guidelines could improve consistency in speaker introductions. Methods: SSO 2021 abstract submitters received a survey regarding demographics and preferred form of address at the meeting. Respectful discourse guidelines were developed and distributed to meeting moderators. Speaker introductions were reviewed for the 2021 SSO annual meeting and were compared with the 2018 and 2019 meetings. Results: The survey response rate was 183/347 (53%) abstract submitters, most of whom (143/183, 78%) indicated preference for a professional form of address (Doctor/Professor) during speaker introductions, which was significantly greater than those who were introduced with a professional form of address during the 2018 and 2019 meetings (351/499, 70%; Chi-square = 4.08, p = 0.043).

Above all, if we consider that its objectives should include the development of a responsible sexuality, free from prejudice and respectful of differences and not only focused on the preventive model. An essential part of this content should be the analysis of sexism present in our society and its consequences in daily life, among other things. This work analyses the knowledge and attitudes of 668 students at the University of Huelva regarding sexism, double standards and the erotophilia/erotophobia dimension, conducts that favour the appearance of undesirable behaviours such as discrimination on the basis of sex. To this end, they filled in a sociodemographic inventory and three specific questionnaires (EROS scale, Double Standard scale and Ambivalent Sexism questionnaire). The results are consistent with those of other studies in which heterosexual males scored significantly higher on all the studied variables, notably the hostile sexism scale, especially in students carrying out their training in the area of physical education and sport who declared their heterosexuality and right-leaning political orientation. In turn, the erotophilia variable is identified as a predictor of achieving lower scores in double standards and in sexism, allowing us to conclude that a positive attitude towards sexuality that encourages increasing knowledge of the same makes us less prejudicial and less discriminatory. They thus provide new evidence of the importance of training in sexuality for future educators if the aim is to transfer tolerant and egalitarian attitudes to the classroom.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Revista Electronica Interuniversitaria de Formacion del Profesorado,21100902635,0,25,Training of university students in gender and sexuality as a preventive strategy against classroom sexism La formación del alumnado universitario en género y sexualidad como estrategia preventiva del sexismo en las aulas,1,true,10.6018/reifop.533411,AUFOP,143,Revista Electronica Interuniversitaria de Formación del Profesorado,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,2188122986,Antonio Daniel García Rojas,2188120808,F.

146,"© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The information systems (IS) literature has examined sexism and gender inequality issues primarily in the context of the IS workforce. I suggest that we should extend this perspective by emphasising the role of technologies in promoting sexist attitudes in youth. A review of the literature suggests that hedonic technologies, such as videogames, video streaming and social media sites, have been often portrayed as delivering sexist content, and through cultivation, producing sexist attitudes and behaviours. Here, I build on cultivation, objectification, and ambivalent sexism theories, and hypothesise that (1) such effects exist in teenage users of videogames, video streaming services and social media, and that (2) such effects are more pronounced in males. Findings based on two secondary, large nationally representative datasets (n1= 3,300, n2= 3,946) of high school seniors do not, for the most part, support the hypotheses. The persistent non-significant and sometimes opposite to expectation findings are very informative, because they demonstrate that the overall role of modern hedonic technologies in driving sexism in teenagers may be limited or even positive, despite claims in popular media and findings of prior lab-based research. This is because the use time of videogames was only weakly associated with sexist attitudes and use time of social media and streaming services was associated with reduced sexist attitudes. The findings make first strides toward understanding the topic of IS content delivery and sexism and pave the way for more IS research on this important topic.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Behaviour and Information Technology,12125,0,,Can hedonic technology use drive sexism in youth?

We hypothesized that men's personal relative deprivation, a subjectively perceived disadvantage, would predict their hostile sexism toward women. In addition, we expected that, if this effect occurs, a sense of control would act as a mediator. Five studies (N = 1352) confirmed these hypotheses. Study 1 showed that personal relative deprivation predicted hostile sexism only for men, but not for women among Chinese college students. In addition, we observed the effect of personal relative deprivation only on hostile sexism, but not on benevolent sexism. Study 2, which employed participants from the United States, directly replicated the findings of Study 1. Studies 3 and 4 further showed that a sense of control acted as a mediator in this process. As such, increased hostile sexism attitude (Study 3) and hostile sexism behavior (Study 4) predicted by personal relative deprivation could result from a reduced sense of control.

It may cause significant, long-lasting trauma and difficulties with mental and physical issues. This condition may also result in difficulties in personal lives. Because of this, detecting and reporting such offensive posts may help avoid the harmful repercussions of cyberbullying. Some studies are available in this context, and it was found that deep learning algorithms are more efficient in detecting abusive texts on social media. Some studies were carried out on deep learning algorithms. The issue was not solved, and more studies are needed to find the most efficient model to control this problem. It was observed from the literature survey that the performance of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures is good. Therefore, the objective of this study was to find and develop an efficient model to detect cyberbullying texts on social media. For this research, the Twitter dataset was used, which was uploaded by Munki Albright in Kaggle. The dataset consists suspicious, cyberbullying, hate and suicidal classifications. This research was focused on cyberbullying texts. Sentiment analysis was implemented to classify the cyberbullying posts. For that, sexism (Class 2), racism (Class 1) and either (Class 0) classification were analyzed. Researchers applied the LSTM, GRU and Bidirectional LSTM architectures of RNN to perform the sentiment analysis. All models gave somewhat similar results. When we consider f1, GRU shows a better F1 score for all the classes when compared to others (Class 0 was 95%, Class 1-70%, and Class 0 was 56%). GRU shows the best results for this data set compared to other models. Based on the Accuracy, all three architectures were obtained at around 90%. However, GRU has outperformed the other two models in accuracy as well. After that, researchers developed an ensemble model using all three models. In the ensemble, each model has been given weight. Since the GRU is the best performing model, it was given 0.4, and the other two models were assigned 0.3 each. The ensemble model performed well in F1 measurement (57%) and accuracy (91.17%). When we compared the previous works against the proposed model, our ensemble model obtained the highest values and performed well in detecting cyberbullying in sentiment analysis.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative Results,21100216519,0,13,Detection of Cyberbullying in Social Media to Control Users' Mental Health Issues Using Recurrent Neural Network Architectures,1,true,10.47750/pnr.2022.13.S03.072,ResearchTrentz Academy Publishing Education Services,150,Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative Results,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

153,"©, Copyright © Melvin Bornstein, Joseph Lichtenberg.Sabina Spielrein, Helene Deutsch and Karen Horney, pioneer women in psychoanalytical movement, made original contributions to psychoanalysis as a subjective and intersubjective field. Their biographies and main psychoanalytical conceptions are addressed in this article, underscoring the originality of their contributions to the subject of symbolization, primitive experiences and intersubjectivity. Women’s mental life, as reviewed, is addressed by the three authoresses from an innovative angle, recognizing specificities of the feminine nature, and questioning classical infantile sexuality models. Besides the traditional conception that the same drives take different paths in female and male psychological structures, the present work underscores the fact that the pioneer psychoanalysts’ ideas point to the recognition of the existence of specific feminine drives. Over time, psychoanalytical theory has moved away from the initial phallocentrism and patriarchalism, as discussed, making room, in its therapeutic branch, for historically female attributes: empathy, intuition, primitive interaction, holding and containment. Although the ideas of these writers subsequently supported important theoretical conceptions in psychoanalytical building, they lack due recognition and tribute in contemporary psychoanalytical culture. This article explores the hypothesis that there is a causal relation between historical ostracism and misogyny. Factors within the content of these women’s work and in their personal idiosyncrasies combined with prejudice and discrimination that was often disguised as academic disagreement seem to be relevant. Freud and Ferenczi’s classical ideas about feminine psyche, built around the conception of penis envy, as well as a universal phenomenon of “repudiation of femininity” are reviewed, contextualized and questioned under a different paradigm: the anxiogenic centrality of the primary object, that is, the feminine figure. The Freudian concept of infantile narcissism is, in this article, reflected upon and expanded in order to integrate the strong ambivalent emotions the primary object potentially builds around itself. Through re-reading the Medusa myth, the author discusses the Thanatic fate of the primitive maternal figure. Persistent desire and the equivalent aversion and claustrophobic panic linked to the fantasy of (re)union with the maternal object underpin the hypothesis this paper poses, that is, matricide as a protofantasy in human mind, with its direct unconscious implications in culture and misogyny.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Psychoanalytic Inquiry,13419,0,42,"Pioneer Women in Psychoanalysis: Subjectivity, Intersubjectivity and the Fates of the Primitive Object",0,false,10.1080/07351690.2022.2121141,Routledge,153,Psychoanalytic inquiry,2022.0,45.0,0.0,,2190285461,Idete Zimerman Bizzi,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gender, Work & Organization published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Studies of sexual harassment in professional contexts, including academia, provide detailed explanations of the predominance and pervasiveness of sexist organizational norms that enable harassing behavior—and offer a thorough critique of the structures and practices that support and reproduce these norms. When sexist organizational norms are linked to acts of sexual harassment, it becomes clear that harassment is systemic, and that organizations tend to justify and excuse the very norms and behaviors that propagate harassment. Focusing on the context of Danish universities, we do not ask whether sexism exists in Danish society generally and in academia specifically, but rather, why issues of systemic sexism and normalized sexual harassment have been ignored for so long and how sexist organizational norms have been maintained. Based on an investigation of prevalent rhetorical strategies for legitimating sexual harassment and gendered discrimination, we discuss how recognizing these strategies may translate into concerted action against them. Introducing queer organization studies as a lever for such translation, we suggest that a norm-critical approach may, first, explain how currently dominant norms offer sexist excuses for continued harassment and, consequently, delegitimize and change these unjust norms and the untenable practices they support.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,"Gender, Work and Organization",19295,0,,Organizational norms of sexual harassment and gender discrimination in Danish academia: From recognizing through contesting to queering pervasive rhetorical legitimation strategies,1,true,10.1111/gwao.12924,John Wiley and Sons Inc,154,"Gender, Work &amp; Organization",2022.0,42.0,0.0,,1485894271,B.

Despite this, a growing body of research confirms that female service members face prejudiced treatment while conducting their work in these organizations that continue to be predominately masculine and male-dominated. In particular, women attending the Canadian Military Colleges (CMCs) experience gender-related conflicts arising from the dissimilar fitness test standards between male and female cadets. There have been, however, few studies that scrutinize the psychological mechanisms of these tensions. The aim of this study was to unpack the existing biased perceptions against women pertaining to physical fitness through ambivalent sexism, social dominance orientation, and right-wing authoritarianism. Officer and naval cadets (n = 167, 33.5% women) at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) completed survey measures. Indirect effect analyses showed that cadets who viewed the fitness standards to be unfair expressed more hostile rather than benevolent sexist outlooks against women, and these negative feelings were connected to greater levels of social dominance and right-wing authoritarianism.

Multiple factors may interact synergistically to increase this risk. This analysis assessed the prevalence of symptoms of depression among MSM in Brazil and synergistic effects of several factors. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 12 cities using respondent-driven sampling. Sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics were collected. The PHQ-9 was used to screen for depression. Having moderate-severe depressive symptoms was compared to none-mild using logistic regression. The syndemic factor was a composite of hazardous alcohol use, sexual violence, and discrimination due to sexual orientation. Those with one to three of these factors were compared to those with none. Results: The weighted prevalence of moderate-severe depressive symptoms was 24.9% (95%CI = 21.8-28.8) and 16.2%, 22.9%, 46.0% and 51.0% when none, one, two, or three syndemic factors were present, respectively, indicating a dose-response effect. Perception of HIV risk, high level of HIV knowledge, known HIV infection, and health self-rated as poor or very poor were also associated with depressive symptoms.

However, most research has been done in North America and Europe. In the present study, we aimed to approach in an exploratory way to the social perceptions of sexist humour in Costa Rica. Data was gathered through an online survey, participants (N = 323; 220 females) completed measures to characterise expressions of sexist humour. The main measures included perceived funniness, frequency and means of exposure, and perceived offensiveness, as well as completing the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). Overall, previous exposure to this kind of humour was remarkably high. No significant differences were observed between women's and men's perceptions of the frequency, means and places of exposure, but emotional and behavioural reactions to sexist humour were gender-based. Women reported higher displeasure, more confrontation and felt angrier and more offended than men when exposed to this type of humour. Data support existing evidence of the relationship with sexist ideology. Specifically, hostile sexism was found to be a significant predictor of perceived funniness and offensiveness of the sexist jokes. An interaction effect between hostile sexism and the sex of participants was found, showing that as hostile sexism increased, perceived offensiveness decreased, but more rapidly for men.

158,"© The Author(s) 2022.Reassessing the confluence model of men’s risk for sexual aggression—the confluence model of sexual aggression has been widely used to study men’s risk for perpetrating sexual violence. Over time, researchers have attempted to expand this model to improve its predictive utility. Unfortunately, this work has continued to produce similar results with only slight improvements in prediction at best. One explanation for the inability to enhance the model could be due to changes in the dating landscape and shifts in beliefs about gender roles. Therefore, the current study aims to reassess the confluence model using a more contemporary construct, hostile sexism, in an effort to improve the predictive utility of the confluence model of sexual aggression. Participants were 258 college men recruited from a medium-sized public university in the northeastern United States, using an online participant pool of students who volunteered to participate as part of a requirement for a psychology course. Structural equation modeling using mean- and variance-adjusted weighted least squares estimation indicated that the confluence of hostile sexism and impersonal sex appears to be a better predictor of sexual aggression in comparison to the confluence of hostile masculinity and impersonal sex. The results suggest that replacing hostile masculinity with hostile sexism may produce a model that is better able to predict men’s risk for perpetrating sexual aggression. These results can provide insight for future iterations of the confluence model, which may include hostile sexism as a core construct. Attitudes that stem from hostile sexism may be a beneficial target for future interventions designed to decrease the frequency of perpetration.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,0,,Reassessing the Confluence Model of Men’s Risk for Sexual Aggression,2,,10.1177/08862605221127376,SAGE Publications Inc.,158,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2022.0,106.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The Model Most Predictive of Sexual Aggression is identified as the model most predictive of Impersonal Sex and Structural Models are identified.'}",152669488,Ebru Yucel,4801945,D.

159,"© The Author(s) 2022.We examined the content of and reactions to stereotypical comments about men and women. In Study 1, daily comments participants recalled hearing people make about “what men/women are like” were generally negative and targeted the other gender. Men rejected negative comments about both genders, whereas women rejected negative comments about women more than comments about men. In Study 2, college participants could confront an online interaction partner who made an other-gender sexist comment. Women confronted a comment targeting women and had more negative reactions to sexism directed at a woman than at a man; men had equivalent, negative reactions to sexism that did not depend on target gender.

160,"© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Anti-feminism and misogyny online have intensified globally over the last decade, bringing substantive challenges to feminist identification and activism. This article explores the strategies for silencing and expelling feminists via the deployment of an anti-feminist discourse online, in response to feminism’s increasing visibility in China. Data was collected via observation of 23 influential feminist accounts on Weibo. This was bolstered by data from 10 semi-structured interviews with feminist Weibo account contributors. By applying critical discourse analysis (CDA), four strategies used to demonise feminists and depoliticise feminism online in China are identified: feminists as deviant women, as betraying the nation, as connected to Islamists, and as “fake-feminists.” The article highlights a kind of intertwined anti-feminism that draws power from distinct features—nationalism and Islamophobia. It argues that by interlocking Chinese historical and structural conditions as well as cultural context, anti-feminism diverts public attention away from systematic gender inequality, and onto antagonisms between feminists and anti-feminists, which further restricts the discussion of intersectional oppressions that affect women’s lives.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Feminist Media Studies,5700168400,0,,Anti-Feminism: four strategies for the demonisation and depoliticisation of feminism on Chinese social media,1,true,10.1080/14680777.2022.2129412,Routledge,160,Feminist Media Studies,2022.0,25.0,0.0,,3999068,Qiqi Huang,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,34.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
161,"© 2022 American Psychological AssociationHelping is a foundational aspect of organizational life and the prototypical organizational citizenship behavior, with most research implicitly assuming that helping benefits its recipients. Despite this, when scholars focus on help recipients, the experience is depicted as somewhat aversive that may actually reduce recipient perceptions of competence. The result is a literature at odds as to whether receiving help is beneficial.Our thesis is that this is the wrong question on which to focus. Instead, we submit that more valuable insight can be gained by asking: “when is receiving help beneficial vs. not beneficial, and for whom?” Regardingwhen, we differentiate between receiving help that is empowering (i.e., offers tools to empower recipients to become more self-reliant) or nonempowering (i.e., offers only immediate, short-term solutions). Regarding for whom, we draw from theory and research on stereotype threat and benevolent sexism to explain why the help recipient’s gender is a critical moderator of the link between receiving nonempowering help specifically and competence perceptions. We present a multistudy “full-cycle” approach to test our hypotheses and understand the consequences of receiving empowering versus nonempowering help in more depth.

162,"© 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.The Dark Tetrad is a cluster of four ""dark""personality traits which are socially aversive, with distinct conceptual roots, but which are intercorrelated: narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and sadism. Narcissism is associated with inflated self-esteem and feelings of grandiosity; psychopathy involves reduced empathy and a lack of remorse or guilt; Machiavellianism is characterized by a tendency for manipulation for own personal benefit; sadism involves feelings of pleasure with the pain or suffering of others. Sexism is the group of beliefs linked with the perceived superiority of men over women. Previous studies have found relationships between the Dark Tetrad and the tolerance of the use of sexual violence and between the former and sexism. Furthermore, sexism has been linked with the acceptance of sexual violence. This study aims to revise the literature exploring the link between each of the components of the Dark Tetrad and the legitimation of the use of sexual violence; it also aims to present the associations that have been found between the aforementioned variables and sexism and related concepts, in multiple studies.

181,"© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objective: Race and gender inequities in the incidence of hypertension (HTN) are well documented; however, few empirical investigations looked into these associations, considering the synergies and heterogeneous experiences of intersectional gender and race/skin colour groups. This study investigated the association of intersectional identities defined by gender and race/skin colour with HTN incidence, and verified whether they are affected by educational level in adulthood. Design: We used the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) data to estimate the incidence of HTN between visits 1 (2008–2010) and 2 (2012–2014), in 8528 participants without hypertension at visit 1. HTN was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive drugs. Generalized linear models with Poisson distribution and log link function were used to assess the associations. Results: The incidence of HTN was 43.4/1000 person-years, ranging from 30.5/1000 in White women to 59.4/1000 in Black men. After adjusting by age and family history of HTN, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was higher in Black men (2.25; 95%CI: 1.65–3.08), Brown (Pardo) men (1.89; 95%CI: 1.59–2.25), Black women (1.85; 95%CI: 1.50–2.30), Brown (Parda) women (1.47; 95%CI: 1.31–1.67) and White men (1.76; 95%CI: 1.49–2.08), compared to White women. These associations were maintained even after considering socioeconomic, behavioural and health mediators in the model. No interaction was found between education level and intersectional identities in the IRRs observed. Conclusion: By using an intersectional approach, we showed the complex relations between race/skin colour and gender inequities in the incidence of HTN, pointing not only that Black men have the highest risk of developing HTN, but also that the risk of HTN is greater in Black women than in White men, when compared to White women.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Ethnicity and Health,20720,0,,"Gender, race/skin colour and incidence of hypertension in ELSA-Brasil: an intersectional approach",0,false,10.1080/13557858.2022.2108377,Routledge,181,Ethnicity and Health,2022.0,26.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'By using an intersectional approach, it is shown not only that Black men have the highest risk of developing HTN, but also that the risk of HTN is greater in Black women than in White men, when compared to White women.'}",1973655715,E.

182,"© The Author(s) 2022.Women and men are particularly vulnerable to the costs of sexism in intimate relationships, which may override relationship enhancement motives that produce positive biases. Inspired by error management principles, we propose that women and men should make biased judgments of intimate partners’ sexist attitudes to help avoid the harmful costs of sexism that occur within mixed-gender relationships. Women may overestimate partners’ hostile sexism because failing to detect men’s hostile sexism should render women especially vulnerable to the risk of maltreatment, whereas women may underestimate partners’ benevolent sexism because expecting special treatment that is unavailable is more costly than receiving unexpected benevolence. By contrast, men may overestimate partners’ benevolent sexism because failing to prevent women’s dissatisfaction and anger when men do not fulfill gallant gender roles would be most costly than providing more benevolence than expected. Comparing perceptions of partners’ attitudes to partners’ actual sexist attitudes in two studies of mixed-gender couples (N = 91 and 84 dyads) confirmed this gender-differentiated pattern. On average, women overestimated their partners’ hostile sexism and underestimated their partners’ benevolent sexism, whereas men overestimated their partners’ benevolent sexism. Although we did not make predictions about judgments of women’s hostile sexism, analyses also revealed that men underestimated their partners’ hostile sexism.

Hateful contents may be expressed through popular communication tools, like memes. A meme is an image characterised by a pictorial content with an overlaying text introduced a posteriori, and its main aim is originally to be funny and/or ironic. However, the use of memes to convey misogynous messages has increased and thus an automatic detection of these contents seems to be necessary to counteract this phenomenon. This task is particularly challenging, having that (1) different memes can present the same image, but different texts and vice versa, (2) two memes with the same image but different texts can convey a misogynous and not misogynous message, respectively, (3) misogyny can be expressed by image alone, text alone or their combination.

However, relatively little is known about the role of perceived female support in motivating collective action among women who witness gender discrimination in public life. This study aims to analyse whether and when perceived support from feminist-minded women moderates the association between women's witnessing gender discrimination and their willingness to engage in collective action for gender justice. We argue that the association between witnessing gender discrimination and willingness to engage in collective action depends on the support women perceive from their female friends and family members. In studies of women in the U.S. (Study 1; N = 271) and Ukraine (Study 2; N = 256), witnessing gender discrimination predicted greater willingness to participate in collective action for gender justice, and this association was stronger when female support was perceived to be lower.

I use a feminist autoethnographic method to document and analyze vignettes that explore interpersonal conflicts about unintended sexism. Autoethnography provides the methodology that allows me to link the personal challenges of responding to sexism in caring relationships within the broader cultural context. Three case vignettes demonstrate the processes I undertook. As a social worker, I draw upon process-oriented psychology and feminism to examine the vignettes and analyze key concepts in the experience of responding to unintended sexism.

Current interventions and research goals fail to sufficiently address the need to prevent HPV, and continued stigmatization of HPV as a female disease further discourages young patients from seeking the vaccine. Areas covered: This paper will review the epidemiology of HPV, including the rise in male cases and cancers, the immunogenicity of the vaccine, results of efficacy and effectiveness trials, and the social and operational challenges to preventing HPV infection within the United States. Statistics were sourced from the CDC. Studies were found through PubMed searches related to HPV. Priority was given to articles published in the last ten years, and policy statements from major associations were considered. Expert opinion: To improve vaccination rates, diversified physician engagement in vaccinating adolescents, better knowledge sharing about vaccine hesitancy, and specifically targeting males to bridge the gender gap are all necessary. Further, childhood HPV vaccinations and therapeutic vaccinations remain under-researched but potentially effective methods to diminish the incidence of HPV-associated cancers.",2022-01-01,Journal,Review,Expert Review of Vaccines,20783,1,21,Don’t jump down my throat: gender gap in HPV vaccinations risk long term cancer threats,0,false,10.1080/14760584.2022.2075850,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,193,Expert Review of Vaccines,2022.0,95.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The epidemiology of HPV, including the rise in male cases and cancers, the immunogenicity of the vaccine, results of efficacy and effectiveness trials, and the social and operational challenges to preventing HPV infection within the United States are reviewed.'}",2164388795,Armaan Mehta,2164376479,Bethany Markman,81823438,W.

A decades-long collaboration between ergonomists and the women’s committees of three union confederations in Québec, Canada led to several instances where ergonomists had to confront situations involving sexism or racism, not foreseen during their training. This article will explore four problematic situations and suggest solutions, including paying more attention to teamwork, considering gender during ergonomics training, and developing a code of practice for ergonomics interventions.

Results: Our findings revealed that racial and gender discrimination from teachers was associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology. Perceived gender discrimination by teachers and endorsing traditional gender role beliefs were associated with higher reports of suicidal ideation.

The aim of this studywas to explore the perceptions and experiences of gender difference and implicit bias within the profession of clinical psychology. Through 16 semistructured interviews with psychologists at four different trajectories of their clinical psychology career (10 assistant psychologists, 2 clinical trainees, 3 qualified clinicians, and 1 principal (management grade) clinical psychologist), participants explored their perceptions and experiences with gender discrimination, stereotyping, and implicit discrimination within their roles. An interpretative phenomenological analytic (IPA) approach was employed and superordinate and subordinate themes were derived from the interview data. The superordinate themes included: “Priming a manager—think male,” “Sideways Sexism,” and “Glass Ceiling or Sticky Floor?.” Participants’ experiences were described by a number of issues relating to primed and assumed leadership, societal expectations and pressures, howwomen relate to other women, the experience of a different kind of scrutiny, and sacrifice and compromise. In order to challenge gender inequality in clinical psychology, it would be helpful for gender bias to be increasingly spoken about and acknowledged explicitly.

However, little is empirically known about the incel movement in general or their online communities in particular.

This qualitative analysis focuses on identifying subcultural discourse that is widely supported and engaged with by members of the online community and the extent to which incels utilize this online space to reaffirm deviant behavior.

It is known that such traditional gender beliefs are more common among strongly religious people. Europe is facing a growing population of religious, often immigrant youth from Islamic countries such as Turkey and Morocco. Against that background, we investigate how ambivalent sexism is related to adolescents’ religious affiliation (being Christian or Muslim), religiosity (how important religion is in one's life), perceived pressure for religious conformity and ethnic background (native, Turkish, Moroccan) by performing multivariate multilevel regression analyses. We rely on data from two independent samples gathered in 2013 and 2018 by the Youth Research Platform among Dutch-speaking boys (N = 1637) and girls (N = 2058) between 14 and 18 years old. The results show the gendered ways in which religion and ambivalent sexism towards women are related. For girls, ambivalent sexism was related to perceived pressure for religious conformity and ethnic background (more group-level aspects).

Surprisingly, few studies have examined whether these disparities arise partially out of systematic biases in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), the reference standard measure of ASD. Objective: To examine differential item functioning (DIF) of ADOS-2 items across sex and race. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cross-sectional study of children who were evaluated for ASD between 2014 and 2020 at a specialty outpatient clinic located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to February 2022. Exposures: Child race (Black/African American vs White) and sex (female vs male). Main Outcomes and Measures: Item-level biases across ADOS-2 harmonized algorithm items, including social affect (SA; 10 items) and repetitive/restricted behaviors (RRBs; 4 items), were evaluated across 3 modules. Measurement bias was identified by examining DIF and differential test functioning (DTF), within a graded response, item response theory framework. Statistical significance was determined by a likelihood ratio χ2test, and a series of metrics was used to examine the magnitude of DIF and DTF. Results: A total of 6269 children (mean [SD] age, 6.77 [3.27] years; 1619 Black/African American [25.9%], 3151 White [50.3%], and 4970 male [79.4%]), were included in this study. Overall, 16 of 140 ADOS-2 diagnostic items (11%) had a significant DIF. For race, 8 items had a significant DIF, 6 of which involved SA. No single item showed DIF consistently across all modules. Most items with DIF had greater difficulty and poorer discrimination in Black/African American children compared with White children. For sex, 5 items showed significant DIF. DIF was split across SA and RRB. However, hand mannerisms evidenced DIF across all 5 algorithms, with generally greater difficulty. The magnitude of DIF was only moderate to large for 2 items: hand mannerisms (among female children) and repetitive interests (among Black/African American children). The overall estimated effect of DIF on total DTF was not large. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that the ADOS-2 does not have widespread systematic measurement bias across race or sex. However, the findings raise some concerns around underdetection that warrant further research.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,JAMA Network Open,21100900345,6,,Analysis of Race and Sex Bias in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2),1,true,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.9498,American Medical Association,200,JAMA Network Open,2022.0,68.0,0.0,,1759400,L.

Even though the manosphere has existed since the early 2000s, its activities have been arguably influenced and increased by the perceived need for counterbalancing the growth of online feminist discourses, such as those conveyed by #MeToo. By applying the theoretical lens of networked misogyny, this article explores the following research question: How is the #MeToo debate framed and discussed in the manosphere? The question is addressed through a qualitative thematic analysis of 12 articles and 641 comments about #MeToo written on the websites Return of Kings and A Voice for Men, which are part of the groups Pick-Up Artists and Men’s Right Movement, respectively. The analysis highlights some dominant themes: first, criticism and verbal abuse against women; second, dismissal of rape and description of #MeToo as a feminist conspiracy; third, perceived victimization of men and a desire to reestablish patriarchal values. This suggests that the manosphere is not a homogeneous network but a cluster of misogynist networks characterized by different viewpoints and degrees of violence, and entangled with racist, homophobic, and far-right ideologies.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Feminist Media Studies,5700168400,2,,“Victims of feminism”: exploring networked misogyny and #MeToo in the manosphere,1,true,10.1080/14680777.2022.2029925,Routledge,202,Feminist Media Studies,2022.0,19.0,0.0,,2104120756,Valerie Dickel,98167204,Giulia Evolvi,,,,,,,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,38.0,159.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study, which is cross-cutting in its approach and ex-post-facto in its design with a sample of 777 adolescents in Castilla-La Mancha, is to discover the difference between boys and girls respecting the distorted beliefs about women and the use of violence, as well as the relationship between distorted thinking and religiosity, political positioning and the consumption of pornography. The results show that boys show greater tolerance towards these beliefs than girls. Moreover, statistically-significant differences were found between those who considered themselves very religious people, who were politically positioned on the political Right and who consumed some pornography; and those who were not very or not at all religious, who were politically situated in the political centre or Left, and who consumed no or almost no pornography, respectively. The structural equation model shows that sexism is directly related to distorted thinking, while its relationship with religiosity and political conservatism is indirect. It underlines the importance of identifying these thoughts among adolescents so as to prevent the acceptance of violence in future couple relationships.

People often ascribe greater humanness to groups that they socially value, but do they also systematically ascribe social value to different individuals? Here, we tested whether people (de)humanize individuals based on social traits inferred from their facial appearance, focusing on attractiveness and intelligence. Across five studies, less attractive and less intelligent-looking individuals seemed less human, but this varied by target gender: Attractiveness better predicted humanness attributions to women whereas perceived intelligence better predicted humanness attributions to men (Study 1). This difference seems to stem from gender stereotypes (preregistered Studies 2 and 3) and even extends to attributions of children’s humanness (preregistered Study 4). Moreover, this gender difference leads to biases in moral treatment that confer more value to the lives of attractive women and intelligent-looking men (preregistered Study 5).

The rise of the hip-hop culture over the last 50 years has turned into a powerful movement, empowering people from various communities and making their voices heard. However, certain parts of hip-hop and rap music have started being associated with misogyny, substance abuse and violent behavior. This study aims to find a correlation between lyrics of hip-hop and rap songs that glorify such illicit behavior through their lyrics and the actual rate of criminal activity of individuals that are directly or indirectly influenced by hip-hop culture. This research employs NLP concepts to build a model that detects song lyrics that falls into any of the 3 categories—“Misogyny,” “Substance Abuse” and “Violence.” A comparative study is conducted by training multiple models including multinomial naïve Bayes, random forest and LSTM on a manually collected and labeled dataset consisting of rap song lyrics released between 1970 and 2020. The highest performing model (LSTM—87% accuracy) was subsequently used to detect objectionable lyrics in popular rap songs of the decade of 2010–2019.

207,"© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Traditional gender scripts in restaurants assume that men wield money, while women are framed as ‘accessories’ who do not pay restaurant checks in mixed-gender settings. While some research has addressed how servers replicate this script at U.S. restaurants, no previous research has looked at this practice longitudinally over time. This study explores how bill placement practices are connected to gendered power dynamics via observations of server and customer interactions about the restaurant check placement. Drawing from audit studies from the 1970s and 2010s, this study examined historical trends in gendered check placements. Comparing data from the 1970s in Phoenix, Arizona, we examined data from an audit of 176 visits to restaurants in Phoenix in the 2010s. This study sent out two-person teams of one cisgender man and one cisgender woman, with the woman always requesting the bill. Results found little change between the 1970s and 2010s, as the majority of servers placed the bill in the middle of the table. That said, the percentage of men receiving the bill surprisingly increased over time, while the number of times women received the bill decreased to almost never. This data contradicts accounts of a decrease in sexism and sexist behaviour over time. Further, the type of restaurant and server characteristics (such as age and gender of server, average check price, type of food served) did not influence bill placement tendencies. Implications for understanding the behavioural practices of sexism, the patriarchal coding of restaurant check placement and the importance of tracking and studying mundane expressions of sexism are explored.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Gender Studies,23704,0,31,I’ll take the check!: a longitudinal replication analysis of gender biases in bill placement from restaurant servers,0,false,10.1080/09589236.2021.2018997,Routledge,207,Journal of Gender Studies,2021.0,81.0,0.0,,11801160,E.

However, no study has addressed how to persuade young people belonging to Generation Z to increase the purchase intention of food products from a gender perspective. Drawing on ambivalent sexism theory, this paper explores the influence of the attitude toward advertising and the ethical judgment to predict consumers’ food product purchase intention. We applied a quantitative method, partial least squares structural equation modeling, to 105 individuals. Two advertisements with different food products and female role stereotype categories are using: (1) women in a traditional role or housewife’s role (benevolent sexism), and (2) women in a decorative role or physical attractiveness (hostile). However, the results show that attitude toward advertising has a direct and positive influence on purchase intention in advertisement with benevolent sexism.

209,"© 2021Online sexism has become an increasing concern in social media platforms as it has affected the healthy development of the Internet and can have negative effects in society. While research in the sexism detection domain is growing, most of this research focuses on English as the language and on Twitter as the platform. Our objective here is to broaden the scope of this research by considering the Chinese language on Sina Weibo. We propose the first Chinese sexism dataset – Sina Weibo Sexism Review (SWSR) dataset –, as well as a large Chinese lexicon SexHateLex made of abusive and gender-related terms. We introduce our data collection and annotation process, and provide an exploratory analysis of the dataset characteristics to validate its quality and to show how sexism is manifested in Chinese. The SWSR dataset provides labels at different levels of granularity including (i) sexism or non-sexism, (ii) sexism category and (iii) target type, which can be exploited, among others, for building computational methods to identify and investigate finer-grained gender-related abusive language. We conduct experiments for the three sexism classification tasks making use of state-of-the-art machine learning models. Our results show competitive performance, providing a benchmark for sexism detection in the Chinese language, as well as an error analysis highlighting open challenges needing more research in Chinese NLP.

To help solve these problems, the study identified various predictors of online game sexism, which is hypothesised to predict actual in-game harassment. Different from previous studies, the study approaches the problems from the perspective of perpetrators rather than victims. We proposed a theoretical model that include three groups of predictors: offline sexist beliefs (masculine norms and hostile sexism), game-related factors (perceived territoriality, advancement, and competition), and environmental factors (peer harassment and play time). The model was tested against online survey data collected from a sample of 528 male gamers in South Korea with age range of 14–64 years (M = 34.70, SD = 12.81). The results showed that all the predictors, except competition and play time, were significantly associated with online game sexism, which mediated the relationships between the predictors and online sexual harassment.

The article focuses on the recurring aspects about the author that Benjamin Moser reproduces and amplifies in the biography Why this World (2009), such as the representation of Lispector as a “housewife who wrote novels and short stories” and, at the same time, as an eccentric or extravagant writer; or the identification of the “strangeness” quality that characterizes her literary work and her authorial performance regarding her biographical origins, the cultural and religious tradition of Judaism and the lack of understanding she was subjected to by the Brazilian cultural field. Some of these topics do indeed coincide with the stereotypes associated with the artist in a “regime of singularity” (Heinich 1991 and 2005). However, Moser’s discourse turns them into disavowing motifs that portray Lispector as a “common woman” and as a victim rather than as an exceptional writer. In this way, Why this World enacts several of the critical mechanisms for suppressing women’s writing described by Joanna Russ (1983).

While human development is inextricable from macro-level structural racism and hierarchies of oppression, developmental research often locates processes in the micro-level of individuals and relationships, ultimately obscuring how intimately macro-level forces shape developmental processes. The current paper aims to shift the starting point of the story of human development by centering the macrosystem, and specifically racism (and its partnering ideologies of sexism, heteronormativity, classism, and capitalism) in ecological systems theory and developmental psychology broadly. Through the lens of racial socialization research, we present an empirical example to illustrate how the sociopolitical context of racism is itself a source of socialization.

Inquiring about the factors that can shape the tension between these two driving forces in children, we focused on the role of parents. Extending the limited literature in this field, the present work examined whether individual differences in 3-to 11-year-old White children’s (N = 154, 78 boys) evaluations of fair versus pro-ingroup behaviours in an intergroup context vary as a function of both mothers’ and fathers’ social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and moral foundations. Parents completed a questionnaire. Children were presented with a scenario in which two ingroup members distributed candies to two other children, one White and one Black, either in an egalitarian way or displaying a clear ingroup favouritism. Afterwards, their attitudes towards the two ingroup members who had distributed the candies were assessed through both an Implicit Association Test and explicit questions. Although children displayed on average an explicit preference for the fair over the pro-ingroup target, this preference did not emerge at the implicit level. Most importantly, both children’s explicit and implicit attitudes were related to mothers’ SDO, indicating that at increasing level of mothers’ SDO children’s inequality aversion tended to drop. Overall, these results emphasize the relevance of mothers’ support for social hierarchy in relation to the way in which children balance the two competing drives of equality endorsement and pro-ingroup bias.",2021-12-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,2,16,"Children’s inequality aversion in intergroup contexts: The role of parents’ social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism and moral foundations",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0261603,Public Library of Science,223,PLoS ONE,2021.0,96.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Whether individual differences in 3-to 11-year-old White children’s evaluations of fair versus pro-ingroup behaviours in an intergroup context vary as a function of both mothers’ and fathers’ social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and moral foundations is examined.'}",40540954,Margherita Guidetti,2007830,Luciana Carraro,34441229,Luigi Castelli,,,,,,,36.0,427.0,14.0,53.0,571.0,14.0,117.0,3215.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,Medicine

Pre-prints may serve as a conduit to immediately disseminating one's work, bypassing the arduous peer review process and its associated inherent biases. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1] compare the gender of first and last authors in pre-print versus peer reviewed publications, 2] examine the composition of first and last author pairs as stratified by publication type, and 3] examine the correlation between woman authorship and institutional geographic location and publication metrics stratified by publication type. Methods The keyword ""oral health""was used to search for publications in BioRxiv and Pubmed in the years 2018 and 2019. Gender of first and last authors were determined, and its frequency was considered as the primary outcome. Additionally, the geographic location of the author's associated institution and publication metrics measured by Altmetrics score were extracted. Data was descriptively summarized by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square analysis was conducted for categorical variables which included the relationship between gender and publication type as well as gender and region of author's associated institution. Binomial regression analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between gender and Altmetrics. Results Woman first authors comprised 40.3% of pre-prints and 64.5% of peer reviewed publications [p<0.05]. Woman last authors comprised 31.3% of pre-prints and 61.5% of peer reviewed publications [p<0.05]. When analyzing the relationships between first and last author, the Man-Man pairing represented 47.7% of the pre-print publications and the Woman-Woman pairing comprised a majority of the of the peer review publications at 47.5%. All results were statistically significant with a p-value <0.05. No significant correlation was found between region of institution or Altmetrics and gender of first or last authors [p>0.05].

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseTransgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) individuals are at a high risk of adverse mental health outcomes due to minority stress—the stress faced by individuals categorised as stigmatised social minority groups. This systematic review sought to summarise the key mental health findings of the research on TGNC individuals in mainland China. We also aimed to consolidate research on the topic, identify specific mental health disparities, and offer new perspectives for future research to inform both policy and clinical practice. An extensive search of the literature, published in English and Chinese, was done between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 1, 2021, using PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Wanfang (in Chinese), and CNKI (in Chinese). Overall, two qualitative and 28 quantitative articles were identified. The quantitative findings showed a high prevalence of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and stress-related issues, and greater disparities in psychological wellbeing. High prevalence is also reported in suicidality and self-harm behaviours in this group. Across the two qualitative studies, attributable factors included gender-related discrimination, barriers to accessing health services, low social support, decreased knowledge and awareness of HIV prevention, and demographic characteristics—such as marital status, educational level, and gender identity. This Review also found little evidence of gender-affirming care and mental health interventions in mainland China. Following from these results, the next step is to integrate multi-level, social-psychological interventions with education to reduce cultural stereotypes and transphobia in mainland China. Political and social implications are also discussed to inform a standard set of guidelines for transgender-inclusive health-care services, including advocating for funding to create these special care programmes and services.",2021-12-01,Journal,Review,The Lancet Public Health,21100804406,4,6,The mental health of transgender and gender non-conforming people in China: a systematic review,1,true,10.1016/S2468-2667(21)00236-X,Elsevier Ltd,226,Lancet Public Health,2021.0,59.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The quantitative findings showed a high prevalence of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and stress-related issues, and greater disparities in psychological wellbeing in TGNC individuals in mainland China.'}",32273443,Yezhe Lin,145016686,Hui Xie,2156501110,Zimo Huang,14689966,Quan Zhang,153839784,Amanda Wilson,47287041,Jiaojiao Hou,27.0,100.0,5.0,37.0,299.0,10.0,10.0,39.0,2.0,18.0,56.0,5.0,44.0,478.0,9.0,6.0,53.0,4.0,Medicine
227,"© 2021, The Author(s).Bias in clinical practice, in particular in relation to race and gender, is a persistent cause of healthcare disparities. We investigated the potential of a peer-network approach to reduce bias in medical treatment decisions within an experimental setting. We created “egalitarian” information exchange networks among practicing clinicians who provided recommendations for the clinical management of patient scenarios, presented via standardized patient videos of actors portraying patients with cardiac chest pain. The videos, which were standardized for relevant clinical factors, presented either a white male actor or Black female actor of similar age, wearing the same attire and in the same clinical setting, portraying a patient with clinically significant chest pain symptoms. We found significant disparities in the treatment recommendations given to the white male patient-actor and Black female patient-actor, which when translated into real clinical scenarios would result in the Black female patient being significantly more likely to receive unsafe undertreatment, rather than the guideline-recommended treatment. In the experimental control group, clinicians who were asked to independently reflect on the standardized patient videos did not show any significant reduction in bias. However, clinicians who exchanged real-time information in structured peer networks significantly improved their clinical accuracy and showed no bias in their final recommendations.

One key goal in sexism research is to compare sexist attitudes across different groups, including people with different genders and sexual identities. Before doing so, researchers must be confident that the construct(s) they are comparing are invariant across groups. Given assumptions of heterosexuality, and the central role of heterosexual interdependence, we expected the ASI would be variant across people with different genders and sexual orientations. We conducted multigroup measurement invariance tests between heterosexual women, heterosexual men, lesbian women, and gay men (total N = 1614). Results indicated that hostile sexism and benevolent sexism emerged as separate, related, forms of sexism across groups (i.e., configural invariance was met), but item loadings and intercepts were not equivalent (i.e., loading and intercept invariance was not met). Accordingly, the ASI is not a suitable measurement tool to compare sexist attitudes across sexual minorities (lesbian women and gay men) and majorities (heterosexual women and men). We discuss implications for the centrality of heterosexual interdependence in ambivalent sexism, practical implications for the use of ASI, and we encourage researchers to develop new scales to assess sexism across diverse gender and sexual identities.",2021-12-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,0,85,Do Scales Measuring Sexist Attitudes have Equivalent Meaning for Sexual Minorities and Majorities?,0,false,10.1007/s11199-021-01248-z,Springer,228,Sex Roles,2021.0,83.0,0.0,,46392102,Emily J.

229,"© 2021The unknown etiology of systemic autoimmune diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), with a remarkable predominance of female, have prompted many researchers for unveiling the precise molecular mechanisms involved in this gender bias. In fact, depending on hormones and transcribed genes from sex chromosomes, at least, the initial mechanisms involved in pathogenesis might differ largely. With the aim of elucidating the above mechanisms, we have tried to specify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) extracted from microarray libraries from both female and male SLE and RA patients. Subsequently, the androgen and estrogen receptor elements (ARE and ERE) among differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) and the DEGs located on X or Y chromosomes have been determined. Moreover, the pathways regarding the common DEGs in both sexes are enriched. Our data revealed several ARE and ERE-containing genes (LCN2, LTF, RPL31, RPL9, RPS17, RPS24, RPS27L, S100A8, ABCA1, HIST1H2BD, ISG15, MAFB, GNLY, EVL, and HDC) to be associated with the related autoimmune disease and sex. Also, two DEGs (KDM5D and RPS4Y1) in SLE patients were determined to be on Y chromosome with one had been proved to be associated with autoantigens in SLE.

230,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Background: Letters of recommendation (LoRs) play an important role in resident selection. Author language varies implicitly toward male and female applicants. We examined gender bias in LoRs written for surgical residency candidates across three decades at one institution. Methods: Retrospective analysis of LoRs written for general surgery residency candidates between 1980 and 2011 using artificial intelligence (AI) to conduct natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, and computer-based algorithms to detect gender bias. Applicants were grouped by scaled clerkship grades and USMLE scores. Data were analyzed among groups with t-tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests, as appropriate. Results: A total of 611 LoRs were analyzed for 171 applicants (16.4% female), and 95.3% of letter authors were male. Scaled USMLE scores and clerkship grades (SCG) were similar for both genders (p > 0.05 for both). Average word count for all letters was 290 words and was not significantly different between genders (p = 0.18). LoRs written before 2000 were significantly shorter than those written after, among applicants of both genders (female p = 0.004; male p < 0.001). Gender bias analysis of female LoRs revealed more gendered wording compared to male LoRs (p = 0.04) and was most prominent among females with lower SCG (9.5 vs 5.1, p = 0.01). Sentiment analysis revealed male LoRs with female authors had significantly more positive sentiment compared to female LoRs (p = 0.02), and males with higher SCG had more positive sentiment compared to those with lower SCG (9.4 vs 8.2, p = 0.03). NLP detected more “fear” in male LoRs with lower SCGs (0.11 vs 0.09, p = 0.02). Female LoRs with higher SCGs had more positive sentiment (0.78 vs 0.83, p = 0.03) and “joy” (0.60 vs 0.63, p = 0.02), although those written before 2000 had less “joy” (0.5 vs 0.63, p = 0.006).

While studies show that people who express attitudes of benevolent sexism are willing to restrict women’s choices at an individual level, limited research exists on the impact of benevolent sexism in social policy. Using a single-case study method and benevolent sexism as a conceptual framework, I examined the introduction, passage, and legal defense of Texas House Bill 2 (TX HB2), a targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) law. HB2 was passed by the Texas legislature in 2013 and ruled on by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2016 case of Whole Woman’s Health et al. v. Hellerstedt. Primary source legislative and court documents were analyzed to explore whether and how benevolent sexism ideologies were reflected in the introduction, passage, and legal defense of HB2 as a TRAP law. Four themes emerged: The State has the Right to Protect Women, Women Need Protection from “Bad Players,” Women are Emotional, and Women are Mothers/Vessels.

This article provides (a) a methodological critique of studies on race bias and gender bias in diagnosis and (b) a narrative review of results from studies with good internal validity. The results suggest that race bias occurs for the diagnosis of conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, comorbid substance abuse and mood disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic affective disorders. Other results suggest that gender bias occurs for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial and histrionic personality disorders. The way that symptoms are expressed (e.g., Black cultural expressions of depression) appears to have a significant effect on diagnoses.

233,"© 2021Gender discrimination is a serious social issue that has been shown to increase negative consequences, especially in females when accompanied by acute or chronic pain. Experiencing social pain through discrimination can increase an individual's evaluation of evoked physical pain. However, few studies have explored the mechanism underlying how gender discrimination modulates brain responses when individuals experience physical pain evoked by noxious stimuli. In this study, we addressed this issue using a gender discrimination fMRI paradigm with thermal pain stimulation. We found that discrimination indeed affected participants’ own behavioral self-evaluation of noxious stimuli. Discrimination-encoded brain activations were identified in the temporopolar cortex, while brain activations to thermal stimuli after viewing pictures of discrimination were found in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Brain activations in the temporopolar cortex and the dACC were correlated. Furthermore, pain perception-specific functional connectivity of the dACC-SII in the cue stage and the dACC-frontal in the pain stage were identified, suggesting a facilitative effect of gender discrimination on females’ experience of physical pain. Our results indicate that the dACC may play a central role in mediating the affective aspect of physical pain after experiencing discrimination.

234,"© 2021, The Author(s).Sexism, a permeate form of oppression, causes profound suffering through various manifestations. Given the increasing number of experiences of sexism shared online, categorizing these recollections automatically can support the battle against sexism, since it can promote successful evaluations by gender studies researchers and government representatives engaged in policy making. In this paper, we examine the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism. We devise self-training-based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. In addition to data augmentation methods, we develop a neural model which combines biLSTM and attention with a domain-adapted BERT model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Further, we formulate a multi-level training approach in which models are sequentially trained using categories of sexism of different levels of granularity.

235,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical EducationBackground: Research shows that female trainees experience evaluation penalties for gender non-conforming behaviour during medical training. Studies of medical education evaluations and performance scores do reflect a gender bias, though studies are of varying methodology and results have not been consistent. Objective: We sought to examine the differences in word use, competency themes and length within written evaluations of internal medicine residents at scale, considering the impact of both faculty and resident gender. We hypothesised that female internal medicine residents receive more negative feedback, and different thematic feedback than male residents. Methods: This study utilised a corpus of 3864 individual responses to positive and negative questions over the course of six years (2012-2018) within Yale University School of Medicine's internal medicine residency. Researchers developed a sentiment model to assess the valence of evaluation responses. We then used natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate whether female versus male residents received more positive or negative feedback and if that feedback focussed on different Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies based on their gender. Evaluator-evaluatee gender dyad was analysed to see how it impacted quantity and quality of feedback. Results: We found that female and male residents did not have substantively different numbers of positive or negative comments. While certain competencies were discussed more than others, gender did not seem to influence which competencies were discussed. Neither gender trainee received more written feedback, though female evaluators tended to write longer evaluations.

Traditional values, gender equality, and hostile sexism toward women were all associated with perception of social-sexual behavior as sexual harassment, however the effects of these variables were only indirect and fully accounted for by the effect of negative #MeToo beliefs. For women, having experienced sexual harassment was associated with hostile sexism toward men, but had no effect on the perceptions over and above the effect of the other variables in the model.

237,"© 2021, The Author(s).Sexual dimorphism in gene regulation, including DNA methylation, is the main driver of sexual dimorphism in phenotypes. However, the questions of how and when sex shapes DNA methylation remain unresolved. Recently, using mice with different combinations of genetic and phenotypic sex, we identified sex-associated differentially methylated regions (sDMRs) that depended on the sex phenotype. Focusing on a panel of validated sex-phenotype dependent male- and female-biased sDMRs, we tested the developmental dynamics of sex bias in liver methylation and the impacts of mutations in the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, or the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 gene. True hermaphrodites that carry both unilateral ovaries and contralateral testes were also tested. Our data show that sex bias in methylation either coincides with or follows sex bias in the expression of sDMR-proximal genes, suggesting that sex bias in gene expression may be required for demethylation at certain sDMRs.

The purpose of this study is to conduct a matched-pair analysis to evaluate sex disparities in laparoscopic bariatric surgery outcomes. Data on patients who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery from March 2013 to 2017 was collected prospectively. Then, 707 men and 707 women pair-matched for age, preoperative body mass index (BMI) and the procedure type (i.e., sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass) were compared in terms of weight loss, remission of obesity-related comorbidities, and postoperative complications classified according to the Clavien–Dindo classification. There was no difference between the two sexes regarding the operation time, bleeding during surgery and length of postoperative hospital stay. We observed similar total weight loss, BMI loss, and percentage of excess BMI loss at 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively between men and women, with no difference in remission of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia at 12 months. The rate of in-hospital, 30-day and late complications according to Clavien–Dindo classification grades was similar between men and women.

240,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.Chronic pain has become a significant medical issue. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) is a broadband psychological test that has been validated for use across various medical settings and can aid in the assessment and treatment planning of chronic pain. In the current investigation, it was hypothesized that the somatic complaints scales of the MMPI-2-RF would demonstrate good convergent validity from a structured psychodiagnostic interview and other measures of pain and somatization, and lack gender bias. Patients (n = 200) who produced valid MMPI-2-RFs in an outpatient chronic pain clinic were included in the study. Patients were also administered the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire (MSPQ), Pain Disability Index (PDI), and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID). Zero-order and partial correlations (controlling for gender) were calculated between MMPI-2-RF scale scores and other criteria. Stepdown hierarchical regression analyses were used to detect bias. By and large, higher scale scores on the somatic/cognitive scales of the MMPI-2-RF were modestly or substantially correlated with MSPQ scores, PDI scores, and SCID Somatization symptom count, even after controlling for gender. Regression analyses suggested that the MMPI-2-RF scale scores were not biased as a function of gender. These findings support the validity of specific MMPI-2-RF scales to help identify somatization and psychosocial functioning among patients with chronic pain.

241,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: While assessment of sex differentials in child mortality is straightforward, their interpretation must consider that, in the absence of gender bias, boys are more likely to die than girls. The expected differences are also influenced by levels and causes of death. However, there is no standard approach for determining expected sex differences. Methods: We performed a scoping review of studies on sex differentials in under-five mortality, using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Publication characteristics were described, and studies were grouped according to their methodology. Results: From the 17,693 references initially retrieved we included 154 studies published since 1929. Indian, Bangladeshi, and Chinese populations were the focus of 44% of the works, and most studies addressed infant mortality. Fourteen publications were classified as reference studies, as these aimed to estimate expected sex differentials based upon the demographic experience of selected populations, either considered as gender-neutral or not. These studies used a variety of methods – from simple averages to sophisticated modeling – to define values against which observed estimates could be compared. The 21 comparative studies mostly used life tables from European populations as standard for expected values, but also relied on groups without assuming those values as expected, otherwise, just as comparison parameters. The remaining 119 studies were categorized as narrative and did not use reference values, being limited to reporting observed sex-specific estimates or used a variety of statistical models, and in general, did not account for mortality levels. Conclusion: Studies aimed at identifying sex differentials in child mortality should consider overall mortality levels, and report on more than one age group. The comparison of results with one or more reference values, and the use of statistical testing, are strongly recommended.

242,"© The Author(s) 2020.Even when overt sexism and prejudice become rarer, social norms that perpetuate inequality are remarkably persistent. The present research lays out one of the subtle ways in which sexist norms may spread through society, by pointing to the role of responses to sexism. We investigate how third parties infer social norms about sexism when observing social interactions. In three studies among male students (Studies 1 and 2) and male and female students (Study 3), we demonstrate that subtle variations in how people respond to a sexist statement can have a substantial influence on inferences third parties make about sexist norms. Specifically, when a sexist statement is made and the conversation continues in a smoothly flowing fashion, third parties infer that this opinion is shared among interaction partners, perceived as appropriate, and that sexism is normative among them. However, when a sexist statement is followed by a brief silence that disrupts the flow of the conversation, observers think that it is contentious and that sexism is neither shared nor normative. Importantly, the effects of the manipulation generalized to the perception of sexist descriptive norms among male students in general.

As expected, HS was positively associated with intra-gender hostility toward the non-traditional subtype, and these effects were mediated by collective threat. HS was negatively associated with collective threat and hostility toward the traditional subtype, but only when the target endorsed prescriptive gender beliefs that explicitly reinforced gender inequality. BS was associated with collective threat and hostility toward the non-traditional subtype, but these effects did not emerge consistently across both studies.

Different mosquito species display various behaviors, breeding sites, and geographic distribution; however, they can be difficult to distinguish in the field due to morphological similarities between species and damage caused during trapping and transportation. Vector control methods for controlling mosquito- borne disease epidemics require an understanding of which vector species are present in the area as well as the epidemiological patterns of disease transmission. Although molecular techniques can accurately distinguish between mosquito species, they are costly and laborious, making them unsuitable for extensive use in the field. Thus, alternative techniques are required. Geometric morphometrics (GM) is a rapid and inexpensive technique that can be used to analyze the size, shape, and shape variation of individuals based on a range of traits. Here, we used GM to analyze the wings of 1, 040 female mosquitoes from 12 different species in Thailand. The right wing of each specimen was removed, imaged microscopically, and digitized using 17 landmarks. Wing shape variation among genera and species was analyzed using canonical variate analysis (CVA), while discriminant function analysis was used to cross-validate classification reliability based on Mahalanobis distances. Phenetic relationships were constructed to illustrate the discrimination patterns for genera and species. CVA of the morphological variation among Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex, and Mansonia mosquito genera revealed five clusters. In particular, we demonstrated a high percentage of correctly-distinguished samples among Aedes (97.48%), Armigeres (96.15%), Culex (90.07%), and Mansonia (91.67%), but not Anopheles (64.54%).

The implementation of this policy may affect female employment. Based on this background, this work aims to the impact of UTCP on the number and employment of Chinese women workers, and find out the countermeasures for the adverse impact of the policy. Firstly, the role of the Propensity Score Matching-Differences in Differences model is introduced, and the average and dynamic effects of UTCP on women’s employment are discussed by using the Propensity Score Matching model. Secondly, the survey data on issues related to female employment after the implementation of UTCP from 2016 to 2020 is analyzed. Finally, a conclusion is drawn according to the survey data. The results demonstrate that the implementation of UTCP widens the income gap between men and women. Meanwhile, the younger the couple, the greater the income gap. Besides, the unemployment rate changes slightly after the introduction of the policy. As the growth rate of female income is significantly lower than that of men of the same age, UTCP has little impact on the employment of Chinese female workers, but has a great impact on the quality of employment. Among all the respondents, the proportion of employed men is higher than employed women, which is about 64% ~ 65%. However, it is still unknown whether age, education, family characteristics, nationality, occupations, and economic development of the province have a certain impact on female income, which is worth noting by follow-up research.

Aims: This work aimed to determine the relationship between violence, jealousy, and ambivalent sexism according to emotional dependence in adolescent student couples. Methods: A cross-sectional study. A total of 234 Spanish adolescents (69.7% female, Mage = 16.77, SD = 1.11) participated in the study. Participants completed an ad hoc interview and several validated tests (Partner’s Emotional Dependency Scale, the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, the Jealousy subscale of the Love Addiction Scale, the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationship Inventory). Results: Of the sample, 40.6% indicated high emotional dependence and 14.5% extreme emotional dependence. Differences were observed according to gender (t = 3.92, p < 0.001), with adolescent boys scoring higher than adolescent girls. Extremely emotionally dependent participants showed differences in both violence (sexual, relational, verbal, and physical) and ambivalent sexism (hostile, benevolent) and jealousy scores. Generating a predictive model of emotional dependence, with the variable jealousy and ambivalent sexism as predictor variables, it was found that jealousy has the greatest predictive and major explanatory capacity (R2 = 0.297); with an R2 = 0.334. However, the contribution of the ASI-Hostile subscale was not significant when the ASI-Benevolent subscale was introduced into the model. Further, in a second model where the scores on jealousy and the couple conflict inventory’s subscales were considered as predictors, are again jealousy makes the greatest predictive contribution and shows the greatest explanatory capacity (R2 = 0.296).

248,"© 2021 International Society for Sexual MedicineBackground: Over the last few years, the gender binary has been questioned, highlighting the existence of gender diverse people, who identify as neither (exclusively) male nor female. Aim: The present study evaluated the possible differences in terms of psychological wellbeing between binary and gender diverse individuals, as well as the role of perceived social acceptance and religious fundamentalism as possible mediators of psychopathology in gender diverse people. Furthermore, the diversity of gender-affirming hormonal treatment requests according to gender identification was investigated. Methods: A sample of 563 transgender people aged 18–70 was enrolled (n = 264 assigned female at birth, AFAB and n = 299 assigned male at birth, AMAB), all individuals referring to several Italian gender clinics. A subdivision of the study population based on the gender identity visual analog scale (GI-VAS) median was performed, in order to distinguish between gender diverse and binary transgender individuals. Moreover, a linear regression analysis was performed entering logarithmically transformed GI-VAS (Log GI-VAS) into the models with psychometric scales. Outcomes: Psychometric and sociodemographic data, as well as information regarding requests for gender-affirming treatments, were extrapolated from the clinical interviews conducted during the first referral. Results: Gender diverse individuals showed significantly less intense gender dysphoria and higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to binary ones; accordingly, a less binary gender identity correlated with higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of gender dysphoria. The depressive symptomatology in gender diverse people was partially mediated by perceived discrimination and humiliation. Moreover, gender diverse AMAB people sought a non-standard hormonal treatment more often than their binary counterpart. Clinical Implications: The present study highlights the importance for transgender health professionals, when planning gender-affirming hormonal treatments, to offer flexible interventions, tailored on the patient's needs and goals. Strengths & Limitations: Strengths included exploring whether and how perceived discrimination may affect mental health in gender diverse people. Limitations included the enrolled sample of people referring to different gender clinics, which is not fully representative of the transgender population. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of evaluating each individual's unique health care needs, exploring each single request and its underlying reasons.

To address this disparity, the Science Research & Engineering Program (SREP) at Hathaway Brown School was established in 1998 to engage and expose their all-female high school students to STEM fields through an internship-like multi-year research experience at partnering institutions. We compare data from existing Hathaway Brown School SREP alumnae records from 1998–2018 (n = 495) to Non-SREP students and national datasets (National Center for Educational Statistics, National Science Foundation, and US Census data) to assess how SREP participation may influence persistence in the STEM pipeline and whether SREP alumnae attribute differences in these outcomes to the confidence and skill sets they learned from the SREP experience. The results reveal that women who participate in the SREP are more likely to pursue a major in a STEM field and continue on to a STEM occupation compared to non-SREP students, national female averages, and national subsets. Participants attribute their outcomes to an increase in confidence, establishment of technical and professional skills, and other traits strengthened through the SREP experience. These data suggest that implementing similar experiential programs for women in science and engineering at the high school stage could be a promising way to combat the remaining gender gap in STEM fields.",2021-11-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,1,16,A multi-year science research or engineering experience in high school gives women confidence to continue in the STEM pipeline or seek advancement in other fields: A 20-year longitudinal study,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0258717,Public Library of Science,249,PLoS ONE,2021.0,55.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Women who participate in the SREP are more likely to pursue a major in a STEM field and continue on to a STEM occupation compared to non-SREP students, national female averages, and national subsets, and the results suggest that implementing similar experiential programs for women in science and engineering at the high school stage could be a promising way to combat the remaining gender gap in STEM fields.'}",2137544297,Patricia K Hunt,1664041382,Michelle Dong,2148250949,Crystal M Miller,,,,,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,47.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,Medicine
250,"© 2021 American College of SurgeonsBackground: In 2019, women accounted for 46% of surgical residents. Despite the international debate on gender disparities, no literature regarding the experience in Italy is available. The aim of this survey study was to assess satisfaction among female surgeons in Italy, and determine whether they encounter gender-based discrimination. Study Design: An anonymous, 83-item web-based survey was distributed among female surgeons working in Italy, from November 18 to December 31, 2020. Gender equity, satisfaction, and factors associated with higher satisfaction and work-life balance were explored. Results: There were 3,242 volunteer respondents, 1,833 of whom completed at least 50% of the specific questions and were included in the study. Approximately 54% of female Italian surgeons reported being satisfied with their job, but only 34% with their work-life balance. Among residents, 67% thought they were not adequately trained. The majority of respondents were responsible for most of the housekeeping (60%) and childcare duties (53%), regardless of their partner's workload, and 62% reported that gender affects the way they are treated at work, with most of them experiencing microaggressions. Sexual harassment was common (59%), but only 10% of women reported it. Conclusions: Most Italian female surgeons are satisfied with their professional choice. However, they face gender discrimination, including incidents of sexual harassment and microaggression. Due to the fact that half of surgeons working in Italian hospitals will be females in the next few years, actions are urgently required to build a culture that supports a gender-neutral environment.",2021-11-01,Journal,Article,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,20440,8,233,Women in Surgery Italia: National Survey Assessing Gender-Related Challenges,0,false,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2021.08.675,Elsevier Inc.,250,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,2021.0,32.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Most Italian female surgeons are satisfied with their professional choice, however, they face gender discrimination, including incidents of sexual harassment and microaggressions, according to a survey among female surgeons in Italy.'}",34651474,Sara Parini,7153388,D.

251,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Gender harassment is prevalent in contexts where women are underrepresented and negatively stereotyped, yet instances of gender harassment are often discounted as unimportant and inconsequential. The current research presents an examination of gender harassment operating on a male-majority university campus in the form of a sex-based slur known as the “Princess Syndrome.” Across two studies, the present research investigated the prevalence, meaning, and adverse consequences of the label. Study 1 indicated that the label was widespread at the university: 70% of participants had heard of the label, nearly half had used the label, and 1 out of 4 female participants had been targeted by the label. Inductive content analysis of open-ended responses revealed that the label was a derogatory term used to insult and degrade women by stigmatizing women as manipulative, exploitative, and stuck up. In Study 2, participants read about and rated a female student who was either labeled with the “Princess Syndrome” or not. Consistent with predictions, participants were more likely to discount the female student’s success in an engineering course as due to external factors (e.g., luck), rated her as less competent, and were less likely to choose to work with her on a team project when she was labeled with the “Princess Syndrome” than when she was not labeled. Results contribute to a growing body of literature demonstrating that sex-based slurs matter and suggest that slurs such as the “Princess Syndrome” may constitute a consequential yet understudied source of gender harassment for undergraduate women in STEM that reinforces and maintains gender inequity.",2021-11-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,0,85,The “Princess Syndrome”: An Examination of Gender Harassment on a Male-Majority University Campus,0,false,10.1007/s11199-021-01243-4,Springer,251,Sex Roles,2021.0,118.0,0.0,,81862536,J.

One community that has often been linked to sharing and publishing hateful and misogynistic content are the Involuntary Celibates (Incels), a loosely defined movement ostensibly focusing on men's issues. In this paper, we set out to analyze the Incel community on YouTube by focusing on this community's evolution over the last decade and understanding whether YouTube's recommendation algorithm steers users towards Incel-related videos. We collect videos shared on Incel communities within Reddit and perform a data-driven characterization of the content posted on YouTube. Among other things, we find that the Incel community on YouTube is getting traction and that, during the last decade, the number of Incel-related videos and comments rose substantially. We also find that users have a 6.3% chance of being suggested an Incel-related video by YouTube's recommendation algorithm within five hops when starting from a non Incel-related video.

254,"© Copyright © 2021 Chayinska, Uluğ, Solak, Kanık and Çuvaş.Despite the ongoing shift in societal norms and gender-discriminatory practices toward more equality, many heterosexual women worldwide, including in many Western societies, choose to replace their birth surname with the family name of their spouse upon marriage. Previous research has demonstrated that the adherence to sexist ideologies (i.e., a system of discriminatory gender-based beliefs) among women is associated with their greater endorsement of practices and policies that maintain gender inequality. By integrating the ideas from the system justification theory and the ambivalent sexism theory, we proposed that the more women adhere to hostile and benevolent sexist beliefs, the more likely they would be to justify existing gender relations in society, which in turn, would positively predict their support for traditional, husband-centered marital surname change. We further argued that hostile (as compared to benevolent) sexism could act as a particularly strong direct predictor of the support for marital surname change among women. We tested these possibilities across three cross-sectional studies conducted among women in Turkey (Study 1, N=118, self-identified feminist women; Study 2, N=131, female students) and the United States (Study 3, N=140, female students). Results of Studies 1 and 3 revealed that higher adherence to hostile (but not benevolent) sexism was associated with higher support for marital surname change indirectly through higher gender-based system justification. In Study 2, the hypothesized full mediation was not observed. Consistent with our predictions, in all three studies, hostile (but not benevolent) sexism was found to be a direct positive predictor of the support for marital surname change among women.

255,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The increasing phenomenon of “cyberhate” is concerning because of the potential social implications of this form of verbal violence, which is aimed at already-stigmatized social groups. According to information collected by the Ministry of the Interior of Spain, the category of sexual orientation and gender identity is subject to the third-highest number of registered hate crimes, ranking behind racism/xenophobia and ideology. However, most of the existing computational approaches to online hate detection simultaneously attempt to address all types of discrimination, leading to weaker prototype performances. These approaches focus on other reasons for hate—primarily racism and xenophobia—and usually focus on English messages. Furthermore, few detection models have used manually generated databases as a training corpus. Using supervised machine learning techniques, the present research sought to overcome these limitations by developing and evaluating an automatic detector of hate speech motivated by gender and sexual orientation. The focus was Spanish-language posts on Twitter. For this purpose, eight predictive models were developed from an ad hoc generated training corpus, using shallow modeling and deep learning. The evaluation metrics showed that the deep learning algorithm performed significantly better than the shallow modeling algorithms, and logistic regression yielded the best performance of the shallow algorithms.",2021-10-01,Journal,Article,Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,21100945706,6,5,Using shallow and deep learning to automatically detect hate motivated by gender and sexual orientation on twitter in spanish,1,true,10.3390/mti5100063,MDPI,255,Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,2021.0,47.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Eight predictive models were developed from an ad hoc generated training corpus, using shallow modeling and deep learning, and showed that the deep learning algorithm performed significantly better than the shallow modeling algorithms, and logistic regression yielded the best performance of the shallow algorithms.'}",2064309985,C.

Our aim was to evaluate the gender representation of award recipients from gastroenterology and hepatology societies. Methods: We analyzed the lists of award recipients from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and determined the gender of these award recipients. The primary outcome was the overall representation of women physician award recipients as compared with the representation of women in the specialty. Results: Between 1941 and 2019, there were 921 awards, of which 77 (8.4%) were given to women and 844 (91.6%) to men. There was a significant increase in the proportion of women recipients over time, from 0% in 1970-1984 to 22.0% in 2015-2019 (p for trend <0.0001). Compared with the concurrent representation of women in the specialty, women physician recipients were underrepresented from 1970 to 1981 and 1984 to 2015, equitably represented from 1981 to 1984, and overrepresented from 2015 to 2019. Of the total number of awards in each category, women received 13.8% of teaching/mentorship awards and 3.8% of the highest achievement awards (p = 0.002).

Participants completed a survey on their experiences with gender discrimination, school connectedness, math and science achievement motivations, and the gender-science implicit association test. Results demonstrated that girls who experienced more gender discrimination reported lower levels of school connectedness.

Further characterization of surgical residents' experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment may inform solutions. Objective: To describe the types, sources, and factors associated with (1) discrimination based on gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation and (2) sexual harassment experienced by residents in general surgery programs across the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional national survey study was conducted after the 2019 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE). The survey asked respondents about their experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment during the academic year starting July 1, 2018, through the testing date in January 2019. All clinical residents enrolled in general surgery programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education were eligible. Exposures: Specific types, sources, and factors associated with gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was the prevalence of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Secondary outcomes included sources of discrimination and harassment and associated individual- and program-level factors using gender-stratified multivariable logistic regression models. Results: The survey was administered to 8129 eligible residents; 6956 responded (85.6% response rate)from 301 general surgery programs. Of those, 6764 residents had gender data available (3968 [58.7%] were male and 2796 [41.3%] were female individuals).

The most common type of gender discrimination was being mistaken for a nonphysician (1943 of 5640 residents [34.5%] overall; 1813 of 2352 female residents [77.1%]; 130 of 3288 male residents [4.0%]), with patients and/or families as the most frequent source. The most common form of sexual harassment was crude, demeaning, or explicit comments (1557 of 5775 residents [27.0%] overall; 901 of 2415 female residents [37.3%]; 656 of 3360 male residents [19.5%]); among female residents, the most common source of this harassment was patients and/or families, and among male residents, the most common source was coresidents and/or fellows. Among female residents, gender discrimination was associated with pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03-3.62) and higher ABSITE scores (highest vs lowest quartile: OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14-2.43); among male residents, gender discrimination was associated with parenthood (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.31-2.27) and lower ABSITE scores (highest vs lowest quartile: OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.76).

260,"© 2021Many muscid flies (Diptera: Muscidae) are well-known as medical, veterinary, and forensically significant insects, thus correct species identification is critically important before applying for fly control and determining a minimal postmortem interval (PMImin) in forensic investigations. Limited in taxonomic keys and taxonomists, as well as scanty in advanced molecular laboratories lead to difficulty in identification of muscids. To date, a landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis of wings has proven to be a promising alternative technique for identifying many insect species. Herein, we assessed wing morphometric analysis for identification of six medically and forensically important muscids, namely Musca domestica Linnaeus, Musca pattoni Austen, Musca ventrosa Wiedemann, Hydrotaea chalcogaster (Wiedemann), Hydrotaea spinigera Stein, and Dichaetomyia quadrata (Wiedemann). A total of 302 right wing images were digitized based on 15 homologous landmarks and wing shape variation among genera and species was analyzed using canonical variate analysis, whereas sexual shape dimorphism of M. domestica, M. ventrosa, and D. quadrata was analyzed using discriminant function analysis. The cross-validation revealed a relatively high percentage of correct classification in most species, ranging from 86.4% to 100%, except for M. pattoni, being 67.5%. Misidentifications were mainly due to cross-pairings of the genus Musca; M. domestica VS M. pattoni VS M. ventrosa. The accuracy of classification using cross-validation test demonstrated that wing shape can be used to evaluate muscid flies at the genus- and species-level, and separate sexes of the three species analyzed, with a high reliability.

The most important positive determinants when choosing VS as a career were having a VS mentor, the technical aspects of VS, and participation in a VS rotation. Frequently cited deterrents were the long training time and demanding lifestyle potentially compromising family life. Conclusions: The present scoping review has provided a starting point to better understand the provision of VS education in medical schools across the world. Our review has demonstrated the variability in VS exposure at medical school and described students' sentiments toward VS. We have highlighted the need to determine whether the current curricula are adequate from the perspective of multiple stakeholders (eg, vascular surgeons, educators, general practitioners, a variety of specialists) with a crucial role in the treatment of patients with vascular conditions.",2021-10-01,Journal,Review,Journal of Vascular Surgery,21732,3,74,A scoping review of vascular surgery education in the medical school curriculum,0,false,10.1016/j.jvs.2021.04.024,Elsevier Inc.,261,Journal of Vascular Surgery,2021.0,45.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""The review demonstrates the variability in VS exposure at medical school and additionally mapping students' sentiments towards VS, highlighting the need to determine whether the current curricula are adequate from the perspective of multiple stakeholders that play a crucial role in the management of patients with vascular conditions.""}",88624086,K.

Though the goals of the movement included de-stigmatization and support for victims, the discourse that followed often resulted in highly varied responses to reported incidents. In this study, we examined American adult (n = 512) perceptions about #MeToo and whether gender and ideological beliefs, including sexism, religiosity, and political affiliation, as well as pre-allegation likability of the alleged perpetrator, influenced respondents’ assessments of the incidents. We focused our examination on two very different, high-profile examples of sexual misconduct allegations, specifically against film producer Harvey Weinstein and comedian Aziz Ansari. We found that personal characteristics of respondents related to individuals’ negative assessments of alleged sexual assault perpetrators. Regression analyses showed that higher age and stronger beliefs that sexism exists in our culture predicted harsher judgments of Weinstein, but stronger beliefs that sexism exists in our culture, male gender, lower levels of pre-allegation favorability for Ansari, and higher levels of social religiosity predicted harsher judgments of Ansari. Practical implications of these disparate findings are discussed.",2021-10-01,Journal,Article,Sexuality and Culture,145138,1,25,"How Do Age, Sex, Political Orientation, Religiosity, and Sexism Affect Perceptions of Sex Assault/Harassment Allegations?",0,false,10.1007/s12119-021-09837-6,Springer,262,Sexuality & Culture,2021.0,54.0,0.0,,1393668034,K.

And yet, we lack comprehensive understanding of the relationship between gender and science dissemination online. Our largescale analyses, encompassing half a million scholars, revealed that female scholars' work is mentioned less frequently than male scholars' work in all research areas. When exploring the characteristics associated with online success, we found that the impact of prior work, social capital, and gendered tie formation in coauthorship networks are linked with online success for men, but not for women-even in the areas with the highest female representation. These results suggest that while men's scientific impact and collaboration networks are associated with higher visibility online, there are no universally identifiable facets associated with success for women.

264,"© 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion. All rights reserved.During the last decade, the Internet, and the social networks in particular, have gained relevance as spaces for interaction and socialization. The multiplication and penetration of social media, as well as the volume and intensity of interactions, have led to a migration of the public sphere towards these platforms. In this (apparently neutral) virtual context, where social networks contribute to the construction or amplification of social relations, the Internet is configured as a space of inequality where power relations and patriarchal practices are reproduced, amplified by the sensation of anonymity and its disinhibiting effect. This paper analyzes the presence of hate speech and misogyny in the Twitter conversation around 50 Spanish women with public visibility online and in the real world, belonging to diverse professional fields: science, communication, culture, sports, business, and politics. Based on an automated search for insults and other hate terms, a content analysis of the direct interactions and indirect mentions received by these women on this social platform over a period of 1 year was carried out. The results of this study highlight the toxicity of the Twittersphere for female users. Thus, 15% of direct interactions and 10% of indirect interactions directed at these women included some kind of insult or disqualification, although not necessarily of a sexist or misogynist nature. This violence is especially evident against women representatives of those areas with greater visibility and social influence such as communication and politics.",2021-09-09,Journal,Article,Profesional de la Informacion,6200180164,4,30,Step outside and say that: Analysis of hate speech against women on twitter Eso no me lo dices en la calle.

265,"© 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion. All rights reserved.This study examined the development of the public discussion on Twitter about the abusive comments specific to misogynistic discourse after the suicide of Sulli, a female celebrity in South Korea. Both the pattern of social networking between the users and the semantic representations of user responses were analyzed from a social network perspective using a large-scale Twitter dataset. A total of 37,101 tweets generated by 25,258 users were collected and analyzed. The findings of the network analysis suggest that hubs and authorities on Twitter were closely connected to each other and contributed to promoting the public discussion about abusive comments in response to her death. The results of the semantic network analysis suggested that her death, presumably due in part to continuous hateful comments from trolls, evoked an open discussion about the deeply rooted abusive comments and misogyny that are prevalent in South Korea. Users perceived that sensational news coverage about celebrities and unethical journalistic practices led to abusive comments and her death. The users shared their observations that gendered hate speech contributed to Sulli’s bullying. Dominant words that referred to Sulli’s sexual harassment show the ways in which haters had bullied her, as well as the criticism of online harassment. The results imply that the issue of online misogyny was closely associated with abusive comments in the public consciousness. This study verified the role of celebrities in increasing awareness about social issues and word-of-mouth dissemination even after a death.

The task of finding gender bias in written documents must be performed manually, and it is a time-consuming process. Consequently, studying the usage of non-inclusive language on a document, and the impact of different document properties (such as author gender, date of presentation, etc.) on how many non-inclusive instances are found, is quite difficult or even impossible for big datasets. This research analyzes the gender bias in academic texts by analyzing a study corpus of more than 12,000 million words obtained from more than one hundred thousand doctoral theses from Spanish universities. For this purpose, an automated algorithm was developed to evaluate the different characteristics of the document and look for interactions between age, year of publication, gender or the field of knowledge in which the doctoral thesis is framed. The algorithm identified information patterns using a CNN (convolutional neural network) by the creation of a vector representation of the sentences. The results showed evidence that there was a greater bias as the age of the authors increased, who were more likely to use non-inclusive terms; it was concluded that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men, and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger. The results showed evidence that the age of the authors increased discrimination, with men being more likely to use noninclusive terms (up to an index of 23.12), showing that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men in all age ranges (with an average of 14.99), and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger (falling down to 13.07). In terms of field of knowledge, the humanities are the most biased (20.97), discarding the subgroup of Linguistics, which has the least bias at all levels (9.90), and the field of science and engineering, which also have the least influence (13.46). Those results support the assumption that the bias in academic texts (doctoral theses) is due to unconscious issues: Otherwise, it would not depend on the field, age, gender, and would occur in any field in the same proportion. The innovation provided by this research lies mainly in the ability to detect, within a textual document in Spanish, whether the use of language can be considered non-inclusive, based on a CNN that has been trained in the context of the doctoral thesis. A significant number of documents have been used, using all accessible doctoral theses from Spanish universities of the last 40 years; this dataset is only manageable by data mining systems, so that the training allows identifying the terms within the context effectively and compiling them in a novel dictionary of non-inclusive terms.",2021-09-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,1,16,An analysis of unconscious gender bias in academic texts by means of a decision algorithm,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0257903,Public Library of Science,267,PLoS ONE,2021.0,98.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An automated algorithm was developed to evaluate the different characteristics of the document and look for interactions between age, year of publication, gender or the field of knowledge in which the doctoral thesis is framed, showing evidence that the bias in academic texts (doctoral theses) is due to unconscious issues.'}",1995519339,Pedro Orgeira-Crespo,1403905031,C.

METHODS: Patients who underwent mitral valve surgery for degenerative mitral regurgitation with or without concomitant ablation surgery for atrial fibrillation were identified from the Cardiovascular Research Database of the Clinical Trial Unit of the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and were defined according to the Society of Thoracic Surgery National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database. Of the 1004 patients (33% female, mean age 62.1 ± 12.4 years; 67% male, mean age 60.1 ± 12.4 years) who met this criteria, propensity score matching was utilized to compare sex-related differences. RESULTS: Propensity score matching of 540 patients (270 females, mean age 61.0 ± 12.2; 270 males, mean age 60.9 ± 12.3) demonstrated that 98% of mitral valve surgery performed in both groups was mitral valve repair and 2% was mitral valve replacement. Preoperative CHA2DS2-VASc scores were higher in women and fewer women were discharged directly to their homes. Before surgery, women had smaller left heart chambers, lower cardiac outputs, higher diastolic filling pressures and higher volume responsiveness than men. However, preoperative left ventricular and right ventricular strain values, which are normally higher in women, were similar in the 2 groups, indicating worse global strain in women prior to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The worse outcomes reported in women compared to men undergoing surgery for degenerative mitral regurgitation are misleading and not based on gender bias except in terms of referral patterns. Men and women who present with the same type and degree of mitral valve disease and similar comorbidities receive the same types of surgical procedures and experience similar postoperative outcomes.

Challenges include gender bias in promotion, salary inequity, professional isolation, bullying, sexual harassment, and lack of recognition, all of which lead to higher rates of attrition and burnout in women physicians. These challenges are even greater for women from groups that have historically been marginalized and excluded, in all aspects of their career and especially in achieving leadership positions. It is important to note that, in several studies, it was indicated that women physicians are more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines, provide preventive care and psychosocial counseling, and spend more time with their patients than their male peers.

Although these symptoms contribute to gender bias in the diagnosis of depression, Male-DS can be found in both sexes. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed associations between Male-DS and clinical personality accentuations. Methods: We compared clinical personality accentuations between 78 depressed patients with high Male-DS scores (46% women; mean age ± standard error of the mean: 36.5 ± 1.6 years) and 76 depressed patients with low Male-DS scores (43% women; age 44.8 ± 1.7 years). We also explored differences between the two patient groups and 176 healthy controls (51% women; age 37.2 ± 1.0 years). Results: Depressed patients with high Male-DS scores showed stronger borderline (partial η2 0.121), impulsive (0.112), and antisocial (0.078) personality accentuations than those with low Male-DS scores after Bonferroni adjustment and controlling for sex, depression severity, and age. Relative to healthy controls, patients with high Male-DS values scored higher in all personality dimensions except for the narcissistic dimension. Patients with low Male-DS values scored higher in all Cluster A and C dimensions and the impulsive and borderline dimensions, but their scores were lower in the narcissistic dimension.

Across three survey experiments conducted in the domains of weight stigma, racism, and sexism research (total N = 1317), we find that researchers from a marginalized group whose research focuses on prejudice against their ingroup face a double-edged sword. On one hand, they are perceived as having greater psychological standing and expertise in the research area owing to their personal experience and insight into the processes they are researching. This, in turn, facilitates greater trust in, and perceived legitimacy of, their research. On the other hand, their research is simultaneously considered less trustworthy and legitimate because it is perceived as being motivated by a vested interest, in terms of having a personal agenda in the research. These findings demonstrate the competing biases that affect public perceptions of marginalized group researchers and their work in the area of prejudice.",2021-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,15499,2,96,Public perceptions of prejudice research: The double-edged sword faced by marginalized group researchers,0,false,10.1016/j.jesp.2021.104181,Academic Press Inc.,274,,2021.0,62.0,0.0,,4362438,Michael Thai,1471027006,Morgana Lizzio‐Wilson,116839134,H.

275,"© 2021 The Chartered Society of Forensic SciencesSex estimation of adult skeletons is an important step in forensic analysis. Although the femur has been metrically studied for sex assessment around the world, very limited information is actually available on modern populations of Argentina. In this paper, the estimation of sex based on the metric evaluation of the supero-inferior femoral neck diameter (SID) in a reference osteological collection from the contemporary Chacarita Cemetery of Buenos Aires City (Argentina), is evaluated. Protocols generated using SID in other three reference skeletal samples are also tested on this collection. One hundred and sixty-four individuals of both sexes and between 24 and 96 years old are analyzed. Inter and intra observer errors suggest that the replicability of the procedure is adequate. The sectioning point calculated from the direct measurements is 30.86 mm and results show a high degree of dimorphism. The proportions of correct sex discrimination and the likelihoods of correct allocation obtained with the direct measurements, along with the results of a discriminant function, a binary logistic regression and a Bayesian approach, are all higher than 0.85 (0.85–0.93 for females, 0.88–0.91 for males). When the formulae from other samples are used in the Chacarita Collection, the percentages of correct estimations range between 72.41% and 81.03% for females and between 80.46% and 88.50% for males, while the likelihoods are between 0.73 and 0.81 for females and between 0.79 and 0.82 for males. As the values for the estimations obtained using the statistical procedures generated in the present research are higher than those available for other collections, the method is more adequate to use in the analysis of contemporary skeletal remains from Buenos Aires and surrounding areas. The trends identified highlight the importance of population-specific metric methodologies in forensic contexts and deserve future testing in contemporary samples from neighbouring regions.",2021-09-01,Journal,Article,Science and Justice,27800,0,61,"Adult sex estimation from the minimum supero-inferior femoral neck diameter in a contemporary osteological sample from Buenos Aires, Argentina",0,false,10.1016/j.scijus.2021.06.007,Forensic Science Society,275,Science & justice : journal of the Forensic Science Society,2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The values for the estimations obtained using the statistical procedures generated in the present research are higher than those available for other collections, and the method is more adequate to use in the analysis of contemporary skeletal remains from Buenos Aires and surrounding areas.'}",144872997,L.

276,"© 2021 The Authors. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Non-biological childhood mortality sex ratios may reflect community sex preferences and gender discrimination in health care. Objective: We assessed the association between contextual factors and gender bias in under-five mortality rates (U5MR) in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Full birth histories available from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2010-2018) in 80 countries were used to estimate U5MR male-to-female sex ratios. Expected sex ratios and their residuals (difference of observed and expected) were derived from a linear regression model, adjusted for overall mortality. Negative residuals indicate more likelihood of discrimination against girls, and we refer to this as a measure of potential gender bias. Associations between residuals and national development and gender inequality indices and with survey-derived child health care indicators were tested using Spearman's correlation. Results: Mortality residuals for under-five mortality were not associated with national development, education, religion, or gender inequality indices. Negative residuals were more common in countries where boys were more likely to be taken to health services than girls (rho −0.24, 95% confidence interval −0.45, −0.01). Conclusions: Countries where girls were more likely to die than boys, accounting for overall mortality levels, were also countries where boys were more likely to receive health care than girls. Further research is needed to understand which national characteristics explain the presence of gender bias, given that the analyses of development levels and gender equality did not discriminate between countries with or without excess mortality of girls.

277,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Background: Medical and surgical fields continue to be marred by gender disparities. The “leaky pipeline” effect, representing a gradual decline in female representation along the academic ladder, has been well documented in plastic surgery. However, gender differences in abstract presentation at national plastic surgery meetings and subsequent publications remains elusive. Methods: We reviewed abstracts presented at the 2014 and 2015 annual meetings of the American Association of Plastic Surgeons (AAPS); American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), and the Plastic Surgery Research Council (PSRC). Several abstract characteristics including the names of the first and last authors were extracted. Genderize.io and Google search were used to identify the authors’ gender. Results: We identified 1174 abstracts presented at the three identified meetings. Females comprised 29% of the presenters and 16% of abstract senior authors (ASAs). No gender differences were identified between the meetings, type of presentation (oral versus poster), and year of presentation. The only difference was in the subspecialty of the abstracts. Successful conversion to full-text articles was similar for male and female presenters (68% versus 62%, P = 0.065) but higher for male ASAs (68% versus 59%, P = 0.01). When an author change occurred, female presenters and ASAs were more likely to be replaced by males (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Gender differences continue to be evident in academic plastic surgery with women constituting a minority of both presenters and senior authors on abstracts presented at national plastic surgery meetings. Future work should assess whether flexible and supportive work policies can foster greater female representation in academic plastic surgery.",2021-09-01,Journal,Conference Paper,Journal of Surgical Research,21728,5,265,Gender Disparity in Abstract Presentation at Plastic Surgery Meetings,0,false,10.1016/j.jss.2021.02.010,Academic Press Inc.,277,Journal of Surgical Research,2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Gender differences continue to be evident in academic plastic surgery with women constituting a minority of both presenters and senior authors on abstracts presented at national plastic surgery meetings.'}",47321472,M.

However, little is known about whether similar effects appear in a unique form of intergroup relations, gender relations. In two correlational studies and two experiments, we investigated the relationships among quality of contact, perceived discrimination, fusion with the feminist movement, and willingness to engage in collective action for women’s rights. For women (Study 1a), positive contact with men was associated with less perceived discrimination, less fusion, and less collective action. For men (Study 1b), the relationships were in the opposite direction.

To assess whether these effects are amplified by the gender bias that exists in Japan, we examined male and female worker’s psychological distress and difficulties during the pandemic. An online “COVID-19-related difficulties” questionnaire, based on item response theory, gathered responses from 3464 workers in October and November 2020. The workers’ psychological distress was found concerned to be significantly worse than before the pandemic. Basic stressors related to infection anxiety, economic anxiety, and restrictions on social interactions and outings. Men’s and women’s experiences of difficulties were consistent with traditional gender roles in Japan: men were more likely to face job-related stressors, such as economic insecurity and work-style changes; women were more likely to face non-job-related stressors, such as increased living costs and reduced social interactions.

284,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Background: The ongoing trend of societal evolution in contemporary civilization has allowed increased inclusion of heterogenous identity groups into fields, such as neurosurgery, where certain groups have traditionally been underrepresented. In regard to the field of neurosurgery, the increasing recognition of the disparities faced by women is illustrated by a growing body of academic literature. Methods: We conducted a bibliometric analysis querying the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases for articles on women in neurosurgery using the MeSH terms “woman,” “women,” “gender,” neurosurgery,” neurological surgery,” and “neurosurgeon.” Articles were excluded if they did not concern societal impact of nonmale population in the context of neurosurgery. Total citations, mean citations per year, publishing journal information, and author demographics were abstracted from included reports. Associations between abstracted continuous variables were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Derived P values < 0.05 were taken as significant. Results: A total of 49 articles were included. Total numbers of citations per report were positively associated with mean citations per year (r = 0.7289, P = 0.0253), the latter of which was slightly negatively associated with the age of the report (r = −0.0413, P = 0.0009). Age of publication year was found to be negatively correlated with the number of reports published per year (r = −0.648, P = 0.0066). Total citations per reports were significantly correlated with increased numbers of citations during the last completed calendar year (2019: r = 0.8956, P = 0.0397).

285,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdBackground: Indonesia has a strong national child protection policy. Yet significant limitations exist in laws, policy implementation, and coordination of services, especially regarding child sexual abuse. This is related to a lack of knowledge about child sexual abuse in Indonesia and associated taboos that constrain policy development. Objective: To understand how child sexual abuse problems have been represented in national child protection policy. Method: ‘What's the problem represented to be’ (Bacchi, 2009) is an analytic approach that uses discourse analysis. This method was employed to examine how child sexual abuse problems in Indonesia are constructed and represented in six government documents (two laws and four national policies). Results: Three overarching problem representations of child sexual abuse were identified: (1) children are a vulnerable, at risk, and disempowered group; (2) service access is limited and services are not coordinated; and (3) there is a lack of agreement and clarity across laws and policy in child protection. For example, inconsistencies of policy and laws regarding the minimum age for marriage can result in gender discrimination and limit a child's access to justice, protection, and services. Conclusion: Policy discourses play a crucial role in the construction and representation of child sexual abuse problems in Indonesia.

To address this need, the autism spectrum QoL form (ASQoL) was recently developed as a measure of the autism-relevant quality of life. However, the psychometrics of the ASQoL have not been examined beyond the authors' initial validation study, and important properties such as measurement invariance/differential item functioning (DIF) have not yet been tested. Using data from 700 autistic adults recruited from the Simons Foundation's SPARK cohort, the current study sought to perform a comprehensive independent psychometric evaluation of the ASQoL using item response theory, comparing its performance to a newly-proposed brief measure of general QoL (the WHOQOL-4). Our models revealed substantial DIF by sex and gender in the ASQoL, which caused ASQoL scores to grossly underestimate the self-reported QoL of autistic women. Based on a comparison of latent variable means, we demonstrated that observed sex/gender differences in manifest ASQoL scores were the result of statistical artifacts, a claim that was further supported by the lack of significant group differences on the sex/gender-invariant WHOQOL-4. Our findings indicate that the ASQoL composite score is psychometrically problematic in its current form, and substantial revisions may be necessary before valid and meaningful inferences can be made regarding autism-relevant aspects of QoL. Lay summary: Quality of life (QoL) is an extremely important outcome for autistic people, but many of the tools that are used to measure it does not take into account how QoL may be different for autistic people. Using data from 700 autistic adults, we examined the measurement properties of the autism spectrum quality of life form (ASQoL), a new measure of QoL designed specifically for autistic people. Our results indicate that the ASQoL shows a pronounced sex/gender bias, which causes it to underestimate QoL in autistic women. This bias needs to be eliminated before the ASQoL can be successfully used to measure QoL in the autistic population.",2021-08-01,Journal,Article,Autism Research,17300154985,12,14,Assessing general and autism-relevant quality of life in autistic adults: A psychometric investigation using item response theory,2,,10.1002/aur.2519,John Wiley and Sons Inc,289,Autism Research,2021.0,74.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings indicate that the ASQoL composite score is psychometrically problematic in its current form, and substantial revisions may be necessary before valid and meaningful inferences can be made regarding autism‐relevant aspects of QoL.'}",144789212,Z.

290,"© The Author(s) 2019.The aim of this study is to identify homogeneous profiles based on the five moral foundations in a sample of 376 men undergoing court-mandated treatment for violently abusing their partners. To understand better the meaning of these new profiles as well as their temporal consistency, the profiles were related to different outcomes of the current psychological treatments, before and after a prescribed one, such as self-deception, moral self-concept, benevolent sexism, and hostile sexism. Results from Latent Profile Analysis and Latent Transition Analysis showed good fit for a four-profile solution. This solution was stable from Time 1 to Time 2, both in terms of the scores on the moral foundations and the participants included in each profile. The participants included in each profile were called “Sacralizers”, “All for one”, “Moral outsiders”, and “Purists”. Comparing with standard samples and consistent with the predictions of the moral foundation theory and the sacredness hypothesis, their scores on the moral foundations were clearly different by excess or defect. Those tending to exaggerate or sacralize the moral concerns (“Sacralizers” and “Purists”) were the most self-deceived, the less hostile sexists, and the ones with the highest moral self-conceptualization.

291,"© Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.INTRODUCTION. Sexism and gender-based violence are serious social issues. The objectives of the study are: 1) to analyze the role of gender-based stereotypes in adolescent behavior that promote sexist attitudes and 2) to identify the possible relationships between gender role self-assignment and sexist attitudes. METHOD. A cross-sectional study was designed. A total of 1508 adolescents participated. The mean age distribution was M=14.83. Two instruments were used: The Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale and the Gender Role Attitude Scale questionnaire. RESULTS. 1) Adolescents adopt typically male and female roles; with the male and hegemonic self-identification prevailing 2) there is a concentration of more stereotyped male and female roles in early adolescence, 3) there are differences in self-attribution of gender roles according to parental studies, 4) dispersion analysis shows that men are more sexist than women and regression analysis confirms that traditional gender roles increase the risk of sexist attitudes. DISCUSSION. It is concluded that there is an average level of sexism, with male adolescents being more sexist than girls. Masculinity, traditionally understood, is more sexist in its attitudes towards the equality of roles than femininity. The influence of mothers on the development of gender identity is lower than that of fathers; the latter being a predictor of adolescent gender roles. There is a positive correlation between the self-attribution of traditional gender roles and sexist attitudes, and these roles increase the risk of these attitudes.",2021-07-25,Journal,Article,Bordon.

293,"© 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.Sexism, an injustice that subjects women and girls to enormous suffering, manifests in blatant as well as subtle ways. In the wake of growing documentation of experiences of sexism on the web, the automatic categorization of accounts of sexism has the potential to assist social scientists and policymakers in studying and thereby countering sexism. The existing work on sexism classification has certain limitations in terms of the categories of sexism used and/or whether they can co-occur. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the multi-label classification of sexism of any kind(s).1 We also consider the related task of misogyny classification. While sexism classification is performed on textual accounts describing sexism suffered or observed, misogyny classification is carried out on tweets perpetrating misogyny. We devise a novel neural framework for classifying sexism and misogyny that can combine text representations obtained using models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with distributional and linguistic word embeddings using a flexible architecture involving recurrent components and optional convolutional ones. Further, we leverage unlabeled accounts of sexism to infuse domain-specific elements into our framework. To evaluate the versatility of our neural approach for tasks pertaining to sexism and misogyny, we experiment with adapting it for misogyny identification. For categorizing sexism, we investigate multiple loss functions and problem transformation techniques to address the multi-label problem formulation. We develop an ensemble approach using a proposed multi-label classification model with potentially overlapping subsets of the category set. Proposed methods outperform several deep-learning as well as traditional machine learning baselines for all three tasks.",2021-07-01,Journal,Article,ACM Transactions on the Web,5800207369,9,15,Categorizing Sexism and Misogyny through Neural Approaches,0,false,10.1145/3457189,Association for Computing Machinery,293,ACM Transactions on the Web,2021.0,51.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A novel neural framework for classifying sexism and misogyny that can combine text representations obtained using models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with distributional and linguistic word embeddings using a flexible architecture involving recurrent components and optional convolutional ones is devised.'}",36328737,Pulkit Parikh,3442296,Harika Abburi,2954043,Niyati Chhaya,46722320,Manish Gupta,145205784,Vasudeva Varma,,,21.0,96.0,5.0,15.0,118.0,5.0,63.0,633.0,10.0,106.0,2044.0,17.0,32.0,151.0,5.0,,,,Computer Science

This type of belief is based on the processes of differential socialization, so that educational institutions have to carry out an important work of prevention before the agents of socialization that sustain the subordination of women. The present quantitative study, of ex-post-facto design, analyzes sexist beliefs in a set of 1,840 adolescents, enrolled in 3rd and 4th year of Secondary Education of institutes of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). The sampling was probabilistic through the homogeneous strata method. The results show that the participants are quite at odds with the sexist beliefs in its two components (hostile and benevolent), although statistically significant differences were found depending on the course, the students of the higher level being less sexist. These differences are greater in terms of academic performance since adolescents with lower academic performance accepted sexism to a greater extent.

Could endorsing a female presidential candidate in 2020–21 similarly license Americans to favor men at the expense of women? Two high-powered, pre-registered experiments found no evidence for this possibility. We manipulated whether Democrat participants had an opportunity to endorse a female Democratic candidate if she ran against a male candidate (i.e., Trump in Study 1, N = 2143; an anti-Trump Republican or independent candidate in Study 2, N = 2228). Then, participants read about a stereotypically masculine job and indicated whether they thought a man should fill it.

296,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: The aim of this study was to develop a new instrument to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitudes towards female workers in the healthcare settings—the Attitude Scale Towards Female Workers (ASTFW)—and test its psychometric properties. Design: This is a scale development study. Method: A three-phase structure was used: (1) creating the item pool, (2) preliminarily evaluating items and (3) refining the scale and evaluating psychometric properties. The scale's content validity, construct validity, internal consistency and temporal stability were evaluated according to the scale development guidelines. The scale's psychometric properties were tested with 1,635 healthcare professionals working in six different hospitals. The data were collected between November 2018 and July 2019. Results: The scale items were obtained from face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews with the healthcare professionals. The scale's content validity index was 0.96. According to exploratory factor analysis, the scale consisted of 30 items and five subdimensions; the subdimensions were found to explain 54.48% of the total variance. Fit indices obtained with confirmatory factor analysis were at acceptable and good levels. The scale was found to have high internal consistency and temporal stability. Conclusion: The ASTFW is a psychometrically valid and reliable measurement instrument. The 30-item scale consists of five subdimensions: performance, gender roles, recruitment and retention, career, and emotionality. Impact.

297,"© The Author(s) 2021.This study examined the associations between ambivalent sexism (i.e., hostile and benevolent sexism) and relationship adjustment in young adult couples by testing an actor-partner interdependence model. The sample was composed of 219 cohabiting heterosexual Canadian couples. The findings suggest that ambivalent sexism plays a role in young adults’ perceptions of the quality of their romantic relationship, but gender differences exist. Women and men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism tended to report lower relationship adjustment. Women’s hostile sexism was also negatively related to their partners’ relationship adjustment, whereas their benevolent sexism was positively related to their own and their partners’ relationship adjustment. For their part, men’s ambivalent sexism was unrelated to their partners’ relationship adjustment and their benevolent sexism was also unrelated to their own relationship adjustment. The results are discussed in light of the insidious consequences that can accompany ambivalent sexism. Even though hostile sexism functions to protect men’s societal advantages, it comes with costs to their romantic relationships. In contrast, despite the rewards benevolent sexism can bring on the relational level, its endorsement may hinder the attainment of gender equality by encouraging women to invest in their relationship at the expense of independent achievements.",2021-07-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,30086,3,38,Ambivalent sexism and relationship adjustment among young adult couples: An actor-partner interdependence model,1,true,10.1177/02654075211005549,SAGE Publications Ltd,297,Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,2021.0,69.0,0.0,,1422316210,Mylène Lachance-Grzela,2044446939,Bingyu Liu,40393254,A.

Methods: We searched https://clinicaltrials.gov/ and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 26 June 2020. As a comparator group, we have chosen two fields that are not related to emerging infections and infectious diseases: and considered not directly affected by the pandemic: breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and included studies within the aforementioned study period as well as those registered in the preceding year (pre-study period: 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019). Gender of the investigator was predicted using the genderize.io application programming interface.

Results: Only 27.8% (430/1548) of principal investigators among COVID-19-related studies were women, which is significantly different compared with 54.9% (156/284) and 42.1% (56/133) for breast cancer (p < 0.005) and T2DM (p < 0.005) trials over the same period, respectively.

Hand index derived from hand dimensions plays an important role in determining sex, age and population affinity in forensic and legal sciences. Sex estimation from anonymous body parts has been very important in forensic and legal sciences. Sexual dimorphism has been reported using various body parts including hand dimensions in several countries, but no study using hand dimensions has been conducted among Ghanaians. This study, therefore, is aimed at using discriminant analysis in the estimation of sex from hand dimensions. A sample size of 150 participants was recruited into the study.

In Study 1, women read vignettes about a woman who agentically responded (vs. no response) to gender-based threat (e.g., sexism). As hypothesized, BS predicted more positive attitudes towards the woman who chose not to challenge sexism and more negative attitudes towards the woman who did. Studies 2 and 3 focused on whether these effects are driven by the behaviour displayed by the target (response or not) or by the ideology it seeks to uphold (traditional or non-traditional). There may be circumstances under which BS is associated with positive attitudes towards women’s agentic (i.e., non-gender role conforming) behaviour, for instance, when it is used to support traditional gender roles. Studies 2 and 3 showed that when women’s agentic behaviour is used to uphold traditional gender roles (vs. challenge them), BS is positively associated with support for such behaviour. These findings underscore the importance of ideology underlying women’s agentic behaviour: BS can support women’s agentic responses that violate prescribed gender roles, so long as they reinforce the status quo.",2021-07-01,Journal,Article,British Journal of Social Psychology,12776,2,60,When is women’s benevolent sexism associated with support for other women’s agentic responses to gender-based threat?,2,,10.1111/bjso.12441,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,303,British Journal of Social Psychology,2021.0,44.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""BS can support women's agentic responses that violate prescribed gender roles, so long as they reinforce the status quo, and is positively associated with support for such behaviour when it is used to uphold traditional gender roles.""}",33306072,K.

304,"© 2020 The British Psychological SocietyWomen, more so than men, are using social media activism to respond to sexism. However, when they do, they are also faced with gendered criticisms 'hashtag feminism' that may instead serve to silence them. Based on social identity theory, this research examined how women's social media activism, in response to sexism, may be a first step towards further activism. Two studies used a simulated Twitter paradigm to expose women to sexism and randomly assign them to either tweet in response, or to a no-tweet control condition. Both studies found support for a serial mediation model such that tweeting out after sexism strengthened social identity, which in turn increased collective action intentions, and in turn, behavioural collective actions. Study 2 further showed that validation from others increases the indirect effect of tweeting on behavioural collective action through collective action intentions, but group efficacy did not moderate any indirect effects. It was concluded that social media activism in response to sexism promotes an enactment of women’s social identity, thereby mobilizing them to further action.",2021-07-01,Journal,Article,British Journal of Social Psychology,12776,7,60,Tweeting about sexism motivates further activism: A social identity perspective,2,,10.1111/bjso.12431,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,304,British Journal of Social Psychology,2020.0,90.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""It was concluded that social media activism in response to sexism promotes an enactment of women's social identity, thereby mobilizing them to further action.""}",49755508,M.

305,"© 2021 American Psychological AssociationBisexual women report elevated alcohol and drug use compared to other sexual minority women. This review summarized extant research on mechanisms (i.e., coping processes with minority stress and victimization, disclosure of sexual identity, connectedness to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) community, religiosity, and normative perceptions) that may influence alcohol and other drug use among bisexual women. Specifically, bisexual women experience unique sexual discrimination (i.e., binegativity) and are at heightened risk for other forms of victimization and other stressful life events. Given this heightened experience with stress, bisexual women may use alcohol as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Further, disclosure of one’s sexual identity may produce opportunities for connecting with the LGBTQ+ community, but such openness may increase exposure to discrimination and stigmatization among bisexual women. Findings on religiosity have been mixed, but there is some support that bisexual women may use substances in response to internal conflict between their religious beliefs and sexual identity. Lastly, we found that normative perceptions of other bisexual women’s drinking behaviors are strongly tied to their own levels of alcohol use. From a therapeutic perspective, we suggest that practitioners recognize the unique experience of minority stress and teach strategies that lessen internalized stigma and promote healthy psychosocial adjustment among their bisexual clients. Clinicians may also help their clients find sources of support, which may protect them against the use of alcohol and drugs to manage minority-induced stress.",2021-06-10,Journal,Article,Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology,14144,4,30,Risk Factors Associated With Alcohol and Drug Use Among Bisexual Women: A Literature Review,0,false,10.1037/pha0000480,American Psychological Association,305,Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""It is found that normative perceptions of other bisexual women's drinking behaviors are strongly tied to their own levels of alcohol use, and there is some support that bisexual women may use substances in response to internal conflict between their religious beliefs and sexual identity.""}",2064225795,C.

A large number of females have been entering the practice of general dentistry for the past two decades. The present study was done to assess dental students' perception of gender preferences in dentistry using a questionnaire in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire among dental interns pursuing their internship at different dental schools in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaires were distributed to 482 interns who were willing to participate in the survey. All the responses were collected, tabulated, and analyzed accordingly using appropriate statistical methods. Results: Four hundred and eighty-two dental interns (180 males and 302 females) responded to the survey. Most female interns (68%) prefer female patients for their treatments to the opposite gender. Seventy-five percent of the male interns felt more capable than females to handle stress and workload associated with branches such as prosthodontics, surgery, and implantology. 52.1% felt that female students fared well in academics. Conclusion: The present study shows that more females are taking up this profession in the current situation. It also shows that females are as competitive as males in dentistry and that most of the dental interns want to take up postgraduation after completion of the course. Both males and females are given equal working space and respect in this field of dentistry.",2021-06-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,19700201144,1,13,"Perception of dental students on gender preferences in career choice, plans, and expectations in dentistry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",1,true,10.4103/jpbs.JPBS_803_20,Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications,308,Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The present study shows that more females are taking up this profession in the current situation and that females are as competitive as males in dentistry and that most of the dental interns want to take up postgraduation after completion of the course.'}",4524903,F.

Furthermore, we seek to uncover adolescent’s perceptions with regards to gender differences in the use of social networks, the relationship between sexism and women’s emotional well-being was observed. The study sample was formed by young people aged between 14 and 16 years who were residing in rural and urban zones in the south of Spain. A mixed methods approach was taken. At a quantitative level, a sample of 400 young people was recruited. These were administered a questionnaire about sexism which was composed of two scales and has been validated at a national and international level. At a qualitative level, the study counted on 33 young people who participated in in-depth discussions via interviews and discussion groups.

However, in some cases, controlling and aggressive behaviors can occur in the context of virtual interactions in couples; this is known as cyber-dating abuse (CDA). Identifying factors linked to CDA, as perpetrator and victim, are relevant for its prevention; therefore, more research is needed in this novel field of study. To contribute to the literature, our first goal was to analyze the associations among certain risk factors for CDA perpetration and victimization of, i.e., sexist attitudes and violence justification, problematic smartphone usage and impulsivity; sex and age were also considered. The second goal was to study whether there were differences in direct aggression and control, from the perpetrator and victim perspectives, with consideration of the above-mentioned risk factors. Third, differences in the diverse range of control behaviors and direct aggression between women and men were explored. To this end, 697 young adults (aged between 18 and 35 years; 548 women) completed self-report questionnaires that allowed assessment of the above-mentioned variables. The results showed that, among the wide range of CDA behaviors, indirect ones such as control behaviors were the most common. The highest level of control was strongly associated with the inability to manage behaviors under certain emotional states, especially negative ones, along with problematic smartphone usage. Sex differences were also observed: Men displayed more sexist attitudes and violence justification, and perceived that they were more controlled by their partners. Regarding CDA behaviors, men and women showed differences in control (e.g. men considered themselves to be more controlled in terms of location and status updates), and direct aggression (e.g. men used more insults and humiliations than women). The results were discussed in terms of the importance of better understanding these risk factors to attenuate the increasing prevalence of CDA in relationships.",2021-06-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,7,16,"Cyber-dating abuse in young adult couples: Relations with sexist attitudes and violence justification, smartphone usage and impulsivity",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0253180,Public Library of Science,310,PLoS ONE,2021.0,85.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results showed that, among the wide range of CDA behaviors, indirect ones such as control behaviors were the most common and the highest level of control was strongly associated with the inability to manage behaviors under certain emotional states, especially negative ones, along with problematic smartphone usage.'}",40260529,Rocío Linares,1665397314,María Aranda,2092278734,M.

Method This national retrospective study examined end-of-year medical knowledge (MK) and patient care (PC) milestone ratings and IM In-Training Examination (IM-ITE) and IM Certification Examination (IM-CE) scores for 2 cohorts (2014-2017, 2015-2018) of U.S. IM residents at ACGME-accredited programs. It included 20,098/21,440 (94%) residents, with 9,424 women (47%) and 10,674 men (53%). Descriptive statistics and differential prediction techniques using hierarchical linear models were performed. Results For MK milestone ratings in PGY-1, men and women showed no statistical difference at a significance level of.01 (P =.02). In PGY-2 and PGY-3, men received statistically higher average MK ratings than women (P =.002 and P <.001, respectively). In contrast, men and women received equivalent average PC ratings in each PGY (P =.47, P =.72, and P =.80, for PGY-1, PGY-2, and PGY-3, respectively). Men slightly outperformed women with similar MK or PC ratings in PGY-1 and PGY-2 on the IM-ITE by about 1.7 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, after adjusting for covariates. For PGY-3 ratings, women and men with similar milestone ratings performed equivalently on the IM-CE. Conclusions Milestone ratings were largely similar for women and men. Generally, women and men with similar MK or PC milestone ratings performed similarly on future examinations. Although there were small differences favoring men on earlier examinations, these differences disappeared by the final training year. It is questionable whether these small differences are educationally or clinically meaningful.

All rights reserved.Purpose Evaluation of the medical profession at all levels has exposed episodes of gender-based role misidentification whereby women physicians are disproportionately misidentified as nonphysicians. The authors of this study investigate this phenomenon and its repercussions, quantifying the frequency with which resident physicians experience role misidentification and the effect this has on their experience and behavior. Method In 2018, the authors conducted a cross-sectional survey study of internal medicine, surgical, and emergency medicine residents at a single, large, urban, tertiary academic medical center. The survey tool captured both the self-reported frequency and effect of professional misidentification. The authors used a t test and linear multivariate regression to analyze the results. Results Of the 260 residents who received the survey, 186 (72%) responded, and the authors analyzed the responses of 182. All 85 of the women respondents (100%) reported being misidentified as nonphysicians at least once in their professional experience by patients or staff members, compared with 49% of the 97 men respondents. Of those 182 residents, 35% of women were misidentified more than 8 times per month by patients compared with 1% of men. Of the 85 women physicians responding to the survey, 38% felt angry and 36% felt less satisfied with their jobs as a result of misidentification compared with, respectively, 7% and 9% of men. In response to role misidentification, 51% of women changed their manner of attire and 81% changed their manner of introduction, compared with, respectively, 7% and 37% of men.

The aim of this study is to determine whether the presence of sexist attitudes, double standards and/or romantic myths contributes to the risk of gender violence. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at five secondary schools in the province of Malaga (Spain). In total, 879 adolescents aged 12–18 years were included, studying years 1–4 of compulsory secondary education. Their attitudes were measured on the following scales: Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), Double Standard Scale (DSS) and Romantic Love Myths Scale (EMA). Results: Significant differences were observed among the age/year groups for the mean scores obtained on each of the above scales (DSS, p < 0.01; EMA, p < 0.01; ASI, p < 0.01). By gender, the boys recorded higher scores for ASI and lower ones for DSS (p < 0.01). The Spearman’s rho value revealed significant relationships between the presence of sexual double standards and that of romantic myths and ambivalent attitudes (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Adolescents commonly express romantic love myths, sexist attitudes and sexual double standards.

We review the role of sexual selection theory and bring together decades of molecular studies on the variation and evolution of sex-biased genes and provide a theoretical basis for the causes of sex bias in disease and health. We present a Sexual Selection-Sex Hormone theory and show that male-driven evolution, including sexual selection, leads to: (1) increased male vulnerability due to negative pleiotropic effects associated with male-driven sexual selection and evolution; (2) increased rates of male-driven mutations and epimutations in response to early fitness gains and at the cost of late fitness; and (3) enhanced female immunity due to antagonistic responses to mutations that are beneficial to males but harmful to females, reducing female vulnerability to diseases and increasing the thresholds for disorders such as autism. Female-driven evolution, such as reproduction-related fluctuation in female sex hormones in association with stress and social condition, has been shown to be associated with increased risk of certain mental disorders such as major depression disorder in women.

315,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.The opioid epidemic has had a devastating impact on our country, with wide-ranging effects on healthcare, corrections, employment, and social systems. Programs have been put in place for monitoring prescriptions, initiating and expanding medications for opioid use disorder, and harm reduction (i.e., naloxone distribution, needle exchanges). However, opportunities for personalization of opioid therapy based on addiction risk have been limited. The goal of the present study was to develop an objective risk assessment algorithm based on genetic markers that are correlated with opioid use disorder (OUD). A total of 180 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in patients with and without OUD. SNPs selected for testing were associated with opioid metabolism and drug reward pathways based on previous studies. Of the 394 patients recruited, 200 had OUD and 194 served as controls without OUD but with prior opioid exposure. Logistic regression analyses stratified by sex identified ten unique SNPs in females and nine unique SNPs in males that were significantly associated with OUD.

In Study 1 (n = 329), male collective narcissism was associated with sexism. This relationship was sequentially mediated by precarious manhood and traditional gender beliefs. In Study 2 (n = 877), Catholic collective narcissism predicted tolerance of violence against women (among men and women) over and above religious fundamentalism and in contrast to intrinsic religiosity. In Study 3 (n = 1070), national collective narcissism was associated with hostile sexism among men and women and with benevolent sexism more strongly among women than among men. In contrast, national in-group satisfaction—a belief that the nation is of a high value—predicted rejection of benevolent and hostile sexism among women but was positively associated with hostile and benevolent sexism among men.

317,"Copyright © 2021 Magnolia Press.In its first twenty years of existence Zootaxa has been widely utilized among researchers of Opiliones, mainly those coming from Latin American countries, principally Brazil. During 2003–2020, a total of 141 papers on Opiliones were published in Zootaxa (no papers were published on Opiliones in the first two years, 2001–2002). The journal has greatly facilitated the dissemination of knowledge on Opiliones, especially with respect to the taxonomy and systematics of harvestmen from the Neotropical Realm. Those 141 papers in Zootaxa include almost a quarter (191) of the new species of Opiliones described between 2001 and 2020, as well as 112 new synonymies. Additionally, 27 of those papers proposed 182 new or restored combinations. A total of 108 authors working in 25 countries have contributed papers to Zootaxa focusing on Opiliones. There is clearly a predominance for collaborative contributions with more than twice as many papers authored by two or more authors compared to single-author publications. In general, the majority of papers deal within the local biogeographic realm (where the lead author resides). Studies of harvestmen from seven of the eight biogeographic realms were published in Zootaxa during 2003–2020. The largest portion of these contributions were by far focused on the Neotropical opiliofauna, but Australasian, Nearctic, Indomalayan, Palearctic, Afrotropical and Antarctic opiliofauna are covered as well.

American Psychological AssociationConcern that masculine generic language (e.g., man to mean humanity) perpetuates gender inequity has led several institutions to formally discourage its use. While previous experimental research indicates that generic terms like man bring more exemplars of men than women to mind, only recently have researchers begun exploring additional consequences of gendered language. Understanding the range of processes affected is of particular importance when evaluating real-world policies. Yale University recently changed the title of a leadership role from master to head. The present study (N = 341) investigated what exemplars come to mind (i.e., cognitive accessibility) while also probing memory for women and men in the leadership role both before and after Yale’s language policy change. Students exposed to master generated a male exemplar more than would be expected by the incidence of men and recognized actual men in the role more accurately (d′) than women in a face recognition task. Among students exposed to head, both biases were eliminated. The previous literature shows that masculine generic language brings men to mind.

Two theoretical accounts—benevolent sexism as role justification and benevolent sexism as a mating strategy—suggest the possibility of a positive and bidirectional association. Gender disparities in childrearing could prompt inequality-justifying endorsement of benevolent sexism and/or endorsing benevolent sexism could promote traditional gender roles that facilitate having more children. We assessed the bidirectional associations between individuals’ number of children and their endorsement of benevolent sexism over a two-year period in a large national panel sample of New Zealanders (N = 6,017). Zero-inflated structural equation modeling indicated that having a greater number of children was associated with stronger endorsement of benevolent sexism two years later, but no evidence emerged for the reverse direction.

321,"© The Author(s) 2021.The article discusses the morality of W. B. Yeats’ sonnet Leda and the Swan in the context of a widening gap between the sexual mores of earlier times and our own, and whether the poem remains a suitable choice for the teaching of stylistics. I begin by examining stylistics treatments of the poem, and its political, social and artistic context, then move on to consider charges of misogyny against the poem for eroticising and failing to condemn the rape it depicts. To assess these charges I examine other literary uses of the Leda myth both before and after Yeats, including earlier poems which romanticise the rape, and later ones which vilify it. I also consider the implications of my discussion for the teaching of other canonical poems on similar themes. The last part of the paper discusses more generally the place of morality in literature and literature teaching, including stylistics: whether teachers and analysts should promote a moral world view and moral behaviour through their choice of texts and comments on them, or whether there are other valid criteria for selecting and describing a text such as Leda and the Swan. To elucidate current views, I draw parallels with the moral didacticism of the highly influential literary critic F. R. Leavis in the mid twentieth century, and ask whether aspects of his patrician view have undergone a surreptitious revival in some contemporary pedagogy and criticism at the beginning of the twenty first.",2021-05-01,Journal,Article,Language and Literature,5800207537,0,30,#Ledatoo: The morality of Leda and the Swan in teaching stylistics,1,true,10.1177/0963947020983108,SAGE Publications Ltd,321,,2021.0,51.0,0.0,,47144791,Guy Cook,,,,,,,,,,,66.0,4060.0,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Art

323,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.The core of systemic racism and sexism is not merely an emphasis about human differences and thinking that another group of people is inferior to one's own. Rather, the institutional nature of racism or sexism establishes a permanent group hierarchy that is believed to reflect the laws of nature or the decrees of God. It thus becomes the norm of a culture to think and behave according to these rules. Notions of hierarchy became solidified into the Great Chain of Being during the Middle Ages, as did views concerning hereditary racial and gender superiority. During the Enlightenment, such classifications became established by philosophy and science. Starting in the 1800s, embryology and anthropology were used to provide evidence for the unilinear progression of species and races. The first evolutionary schemes were not “branching trees.” In these schemes, women and non-white races were seen as embryonic or juvenile forms of the adult white male, and they were often depicted as intermediaries between the fully human and the animals. Such linear schemes of evolution remain part of popular culture and even some science, promoting the racism and sexism associated with them.",2021-05-01,Journal,Review,Developmental Biology,14536,2,473,"Systemic racism, systemic sexism, and the embryological enterprise",1,true,10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.02.001,Elsevier Inc.,323,Developmental Biology,2021.0,97.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""The core of systemic racism and sexism is not merely an emphasis about human differences and thinking that another group of people is inferior to one's own, but the institutional nature of racism or sexism establishes a permanent group hierarchy that is believed to reflect the laws of nature or the decrees of God.""}",2788389,S.

But how do women experience men’s confrontation of sexism? We examine how women perceive men’s egalitarian versus paternalistic confrontation of sexism. We hypothesized that women would be more likely to report empowerment and well-being (i.e., more happiness and less anger) after egalitarian confrontation than after paternalistic confrontation, which should increase their future intention to confront sexism. Using hypothetical scenarios, the results of three studies conducted in Spain, Germany, and Mexico confirmed our hypotheses. They also highlighted that empowerment (but not happiness) triggered by egalitarian confrontation, as well as anger triggered by paternalistic confrontation, lead women to express greater future intention to confront sexism. Our findings suggest that male confronters motivated by egalitarian reasons are more likely perceived as allies of women because they not only make women feel better but also empower them to keep fighting. Further, women may react against men motivated by paternalistic reasons (especially if they are strongly identified as feminist or endorse low benevolent sexist beliefs).

325,"© 2020 The British Psychological SocietyTwo studies investigated (1) how people react to research describing a sex difference, depending on whether that difference favours males or females, and (2) how accurately people can predict how the average man and woman will react. In Study 1, Western participants (N = 492) viewed a fictional popular-science article describing either a male-favouring or a female-favouring sex difference (i.e., men/women draw better; women/men lie more). Both sexes reacted less positively to the male-favouring differences, judging the findings to be less important, less credible, and more offensive, harmful, and upsetting. Participants predicted that the average man and woman would react more positively to sex differences favouring their own sex. This was true of the average woman, although the level of own-sex favouritism was lower than participants predicted. It was not true, however, of the average man, who – like the average woman – reacted more positively to the female-favouring differences.

Further, we undertook a corpus-assisted analysis of the data, focusing on collocations and keywords, which were then analysed in the light of van Leeuwen's (2008) framework on the representation of social actors and legitimation strategies. Results evidence that violence against women in power can take forms other than the explicit sexual, physical, and psychological threats that are commonly identified.

330,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Impaired fetal growth is one of the most important causes of prematurity, stillbirth and infant mortality. The pathogenesis of idiopathic fetal growth restriction (FGR) is poorly understood but is thought to be multifactorial and comprise a range of genetic causes. This research aimed to investigate non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the placentas of male and female fetuses affected by FGR. RNA-Seq data were analyzed to detect lncRNAs, their potential target genes and circular RNAs (circRNAs); a differential analysis was also performed. The multilevel bioinformatic analysis enabled the detection of 23,137 placental lncRNAs and 4263 of them were classified as novel. In FGR-affected female fetuses’ placentas (ff-FGR), among 19 transcriptionally active regions (TARs), five differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and 12 differentially expressed protein-coding genes (DEGs) were identified. Within 232 differentially expressed TARs identified in male fetuses (mf-FGR), 33 encompassed novel and 176 known lncRNAs, and 52 DEGs were upregulated, while 180 revealed decreased expression. In ff-FGR ACTA2-AS1, lncRNA expression was significantly correlated with five DEGs, and in mf-FGR, 25 TARs were associated with DELs correlated with 157 unique DEGs. Backsplicing circRNA processes were detected in the range of H19 lncRNA, in both ff-and mf-FGR placentas. The performed global lncRNAs characteristics in terms of fetal sex showed dysregulation of DELs, DEGs and circRNAs that may affect fetus growth and pregnancy outcomes. In female placentas, DELs and DEGs were associated mainly with the vasculature, while in male placentas, disturbed expression predominantly affected immune processes.",2021-04-01,Journal,Article,Cells,21100978391,1,10,Sex-biased lncrna signature in fetal growth restriction (Fgr),1,true,10.3390/cells10040921,MDPI,330,Cells,2021.0,140.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Investigation of non-coding RNAs in the placentas of male and female fetuses affected by FGR showed dysregulation of DELs, DEGs and circRNAs that may affect fetus growth and pregnancy outcomes.'}",35050370,A.

332,"© 2021 The AuthorsObjective: To identify sexist violence features on different technological generations (Millennials and Generation X). Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Site: Region of Murcia, Spain. Participants: A total of 1269 users of social networks belonging to the Millennials generation (19–38 years) and Generation X (39–54 years) who are in a romantic relationship. Main measurements: The instrument “Questionnaire about new technologies to transmit gender violence”, analyzes the use of social networks, suffered and exercised violence on couples. The study variables have been the generational group, age, sex, alcohol and drug consumption, the level of formal education, origin and residence country and sexual orientation. Results: Millennials show a statistically significant association with the items on risk patterns in networks related to phising, sexting, flaming, false offers, cyberstalking, and webcam hijacking (p < 0.05), while regarding violence suffered only has been observed association in items related to flaming (OR: 0.405) (95% CI: 0.226–0.726) and sexual coercion (OR: 0.420) (95% CI: 0.200–0.882).

333,"© The Author(s) 2021.To date the majority of the research on microaggressions has focused on the experiences of targets, rather than the perpetrators, of microaggresive behaviors. The present study set out to investigate 278 college students’ (Mage = 19.12, SD = 1.34, 52.52% cisgender women, 74.82% European American) reported types of experience (a) unaware, b) aware, c) observer, d) perpetrator, and e) target) with race- and gender-based microaggressive behaviors and the association between their experiences and ambivalent sexist and color-blind racial attitudes. Participants completed an online survey composed of a modified Racial and Ethnic Microaggression Scale (REMS), a modified Female Microaggression Scale (FMS), an Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and a Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale. As hypothesized, participants were more likely to have heard of or seen than to report having been the target or perpetrator of microaggressions. In support of our second hypothesis, significant gender and race differences were found in the frequencies of type of exposure to microaggressions. Finally, as expected, exposure to microaggressions was associated with color-blind and ambivalent sexist attitudes. Unexpectedly, however, complete unawareness of the existence of microaggressions was not associated with social attitudes.

334,"© The Author(s) 2021.This article discusses the resurgence of the term ‘patriarchy’ in digital culture and reflects on the everyday online meanings of the term in distinction to academic theorisations. In the 1960s–1980s, feminists theorised patriarchy as the systematic oppression of women, with differing approaches to how it worked. Criticisms that the concept was unable to account for intersectional experiences of oppression, alongside the ‘turn to culture’, resulted in a fall from academic grace. However, ‘patriarchy’ has found new life through Internet memes (humorous, mutational images that circulate widely on social media). This article aims to investigate the resurgence of the term ‘patriarchy’ in digital culture. Based on an analysis of memes with the phrase ‘patriarchy’ and ‘smash the patriarchy’, we identify how patriarchy memes are used by two different online communities (feminists and anti-feminists) and consider what this means for the ongoing usefulness of the concept of patriarchy. We argue that, whilst performing important community-forming work, using the term is a risky strategy for feminists for two reasons: first, because memes are by their nature brief, there is little opportunity to address intersections of oppression; secondly, the underlying logic of feminism is omitted in favour of brevity, leaving it exposed to being undermined by the more mainstream logic of masculinism.",2021-04-01,Journal,Article,Feminist Theory,700147308,2,22,‘Smash the patriarchy’: the changing meanings and work of ‘patriarchy’ online,2,,10.1177/1464700120988643,SAGE Publications Ltd,334,,2021.0,111.0,0.0,,49599054,R.

335,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Objective: Alexithymia is associated with various mental as well as physical disorders. Some evidence also suggested high alexithymia to increase mortality risk, but these results are few and based on specific sample compositions. We aimed to investigate the impact of alexithymia on mortality risk in a large population based cohort. In addition, we sought to elucidate the effects of the subfactors of alexithymia and sex differences. Methods: In a sample of N = 1380 individuals from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), we investigated the hazard-ratio (HR) of alexithymia as obtained by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) on all-cause mortality over an average observation time of 10 years. Sex-by-TAS-20-interactions as well as sex-stratified analyses were performed. Results: Alexithymia was significantly associated with enhanced mortality risk (HR = 1.033; 95%-CI = 1.008–1.058); p = 0.009). While sex-by-TAS-20 interactions remained insignificant, sex-stratified analyses showed that this effect was only significant in men (HR = 1.050; 95%-CI = 1.022–1.079; p ≤ 0.001), but not in women (HR: 1.008; 95%-CI = 0.960–1.057; p = 0.76). The effect was validated for the “difficulties identifying feelings” (DIF) and “difficulties describing feelings” (DDF) subfactors of the TAS-20. Conclusion: Our study supports and extents previous findings by indicating that mortality risk enhancing effects of alexithymia are specific to male subjects and validated for the DIF and DDF facets. Socioeconomic, clinical and metabolic factors were associated with this relationship. Finding that the impact of alexithymia remains stable in the fully adjusted models suggests that yet unidentified additional factors must be considered.",2021-04-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,16817,5,143,"Alexithymia is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in men, but not in women: A 10-year follow-up study",0,false,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110372,Elsevier Inc.,335,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,2021.0,79.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study supports and extents previous findings by indicating that mortality risk enhancing effects of alexithymia are specific to male subjects and validated for the DIF and DDF facets.'}",2428866,J.

337,"© 2020 International Society of Political PsychologyPrevious research on support for gender quotas focuses on attitudes toward gender equality and government intervention as explanations. We argue the role of attitudes toward women in understanding support for policies aiming to increase the presence of women in politics is ambivalent—both hostile and benevolent forms of sexism contribute in understanding support, albeit in different ways. Using original data from a survey conducted on a probability-based sample of Australian respondents, our findings demonstrate that hostile sexists are more likely to oppose increasing of women's presence in politics through the adoption of gender quotas. Benevolent sexists, on the other hand, are more likely to support these policies than respondents exhibiting low levels of benevolent sexism. We argue this is because benevolent sexism holds that women are pure and need protection; they do not have what it takes to succeed in politics without the assistance of quotas. Finally, we show that while women are more likely to support quotas, ambivalent sexism has the same relationship with support among both women and men. These findings suggest that aggregate levels of public support for gender quotas do not necessarily represent greater acceptance of gender equality generally.",2021-04-01,Journal,Article,Political Psychology,22861,8,42,Antiwomen But Proquota: Disaggregating Sexism and Support for Gender Quota Policies,0,false,10.1111/pops.12696,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,337,,2020.0,49.0,0.0,,114221546,K.

338,"© 2020, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.It is well established that ensemble coding is regulated by physical similarity and variance in a set of stimuli. For example, observers are more accurate at judging the mean size of objects in a set if the overall size variance in the set is small. However, sometimes similarity among set members can be purely subjective. For example, faces from another race tend to look more similar than faces from one’s own race. Very little is known about whether such subjective similarity also regulates ensemble coding in the same manner as objective similarity. To investigate this question, we had British and Chinese participants view sets of four faces that were of either own-race or other-race, own-gender or other-gender. After viewing each set the task was to judge whether a test face was presented in the set. Our results showed that, as demonstrated in prior research, participants often mistook a morphed set average to be a member of the set. Critically, this tendency to average a face set was not stronger for other-race faces. Hence contrary to objective similarity, subjectively perceived similarity in the other-race faces does not facilitate ensemble coding. The results in our British group also replicated de Fockert and Gautrey’s (Psychonomic Bulletin & Review 20 (3), 468-473, 2013) own-gender effect, where observers showed more averaging for own-gender faces. However, our Chinese subjects displayed the same level of averaging for both genders.

During the past two decades, there has been an incremental increase in research and publications on CVD in women, addressing sex-specific risk factors, symptoms, pathophysiology, treatment, prevention and identification of inequities in care. Nonetheless, once women have manifested CVD, they continue to have increasingly worse outcomes than men. An approach to addressing these global disparities has been the worldwide establishment of specialised centres providing cardiovascular care for women. These women’s heart centres (WHCs) allow a comprehensive approach to the cardiovascular care of women across the lifespan.

All rights reserved.Background For transgender people, reaching transgender (trans)-specific developmental milestones, including recognizing and expressing one s identity, plays an integral role in overall health, wellbeing, and the pursuit of gender affirmation. Yet trans people continue to face minority stressors, including structural violence (i.e., discrimination, violence, and stigma), which may interfere with the achievement of these milestones. Among trans women specifically, however, potential associations between gender developmental milestones and structural violence are not well characterized in the literature. In a sample of Filipinx (i.e., an inclusive term for describing non-binary genders in the Philippines) trans women who are sexually active with men (trans-WSM), we thus sought to: (a) describe the mean ages at which gender developmental milestones occur and (b) examine the associations between structural violence and mean ages at which at which Filipinx trans-WSM experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Methods Using data from Project #ParaSaAtin, an online survey of Filipinx trans-WSM (n = 139), we mapped age-estimates per trans-specific milestones and then tested whether structural violence is associated with the mean age at which trans women experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Results Overall, participants who reported higher levels of discrimination, stigma, and violence also experienced a later age for nearly each milestone (i.e., initial self-Awareness of transfeminine identity, transfeminine expression in private, transfeminine expression in public, first consensual oral/vaginal/anal sex with a cisgender male partner, first consensual oral/vaginal/ anal sex with a cisgender male partner as a trans women, and hormone integration) (all p-values 0.05). Of note, the single exception to this pattern was the non-significant association between stigma and initial disclosure of transfeminine identification to another person. Conclusion Results are consistent with psychological literature outlining a temporal sequence of developmental milestones among young trans-WSM. For young trans-WSM in the Philippines, data from this study demonstrate significant associations between structural violence and the achievement of developmental milestones.

Yet despite its potential theoretical and practical importance, the belief that men are now the primary target of sexism has not been systematically defined nor has it been reliably measured. In this paper, we define the belief in sexism shift (BSS) and introduce a scale to measure it. We contend that BSS constitutes a new form of contemporary sexism characterized by the perception that anti-male discrimination is pervasive, that it now exceeds anti-female discrimination, and that it is caused by women’s societal advancement. In four studies (N = 666), we develop and test a concise, one-dimensional, 15-item measure of BSS: the BSS scale. Our findings demonstrate that BSS is related to, yet distinct from other forms of sexism (traditional, modern, and ambivalent sexism). Moreover, our results show that the BSS scale is a stable and reliable measure of BSS across different samples, time, and participant gender. The BSS scale is also less susceptible to social desirability concerns than other sexism measures. In sum, the BSS scale can be a valuable tool to help understand a new and potentially growing type of sexism that may hinder women in unprecedented ways.",2021-03-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,2,16,Belief in sexism shift: Defining a new form of contemporary sexism and introducing the belief in sexism shift scale (BSS scale),1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0248374,Public Library of Science,344,PLoS ONE,2021.0,83.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The BSS scale can be a valuable tool to help understand a new and potentially growing type of sexism that may hinder women in unprecedented ways and is less susceptible to social desirability concerns than other sexism measures.'}",51963206,Miriam K Zehnter,2030148402,Francesca Manzi,5873517,P.

Methods Author names for articles published in 16 of the top neurosurgical journals from 2002 to 2019 were obtained from Medline. The gender of each author was determined using automated prediction methods. Publication trends were compared over time and across subdisciplines. Female authorship was also compared to the proportionate composition of women in the field over time. Results The metadata obtained from 16 major neurosurgical journals yielded 66,546 research articles. Gender was successfully determined for 96% (127,809/133,578) of first and senior authors, while the remainder (3.9%) were unable to be determined through prediction methods. Across all years, 13.3% (8826) of articles had female first authorship and 9.1% (6073) had female senior authorship. Female first authorship increased significantly over time from 5.8% in 2002 to 17.2% in 2019 (p < 0.001). Female senior authorship also increased significantly over time, from 5.5% in 2002 to 12.0% in 2019 (p < 0.001). The journals with the highest proportions of female first authors and senior authors were the Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (33.5%) and the Asian Journal of Neurosurgery (23.8%), respectively. Operative Neurosurgery had the lowest fraction of female first (12.4%) and senior (4.7%) authors. There was a significant difference between the year-by-year proportion of female neurosurgical trainees and the year-by-year proportion of female neurosurgical first (p < 0.001) and senior (p < 0.001) authors. Articles were also more likely to have a female first author if the senior author of the article was female (OR 2.69, CI 2.52–2.86; p < 0.001). From 1944 to 2019, the Journal of Neurosurgery showed a steady increase in female first and senior authorship, with a plateau beginning in the 1990s. Conclusions Large meta-analysis techniques have the potential to effectively leverage large amounts of bibliometric data to quantify the representation of female authorship in the neurosurgical literature.

The present study examined whether children’s self-perceived same- and other-gender similarity were related to their same- and other-gender positivity and negativity, respectively. Children aged 6–10 years (N = 149) were interviewed about their self-perceived similarity to girls and to boys and about the extent to which they thought positive and negative characteristics applied to boys and to girls. Among girls, greater self-perceived other-gender similarity was associated with more negativity towards the same gender. Similar to previous research, intergroup gender bias was more pronounced among girls, and children rated themselves as having more same- than other-gender similarity, with this pattern being more pronounced in boys.

We conducted two experiments in which male and female Chinese college students (232 in Study 1 and 231 in Study 2) were exposed to either women-empowering or control advertisements (traditional ad in Study 1 and gender-irrelevant ad in Study 2) and reported their attitudes about the ads as well as their purchase intentions toward the advertised products (shampoo and smartphone, respectively). In line with our predictions, both experiments showed that messaging about women’s empowerment in advertising can induce perceptions of CSR, thereby increasing favorable responses such as enhanced positive ad attitudes and increased purchase intentions toward the advertised products. Moreover, hostile sexism was negatively associated with consumer responses toward femvertising such that the lower participants’ hostile sexism, the more positive ad attitudes and stronger purchase intent participants they reported. However, benevolent sexism was not predictive of consumer responses toward femvertising.

349,"© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.In recent years, the dominant Western discourse on “female genital mutilation” (FGM) has increasingly been challenged by scholars. Numerous researchers contest both the terminology used and the empirical claims made in what has come to be called “the standard tale” of FGM (also termed “female genital cutting” [FGC]). The World Health Organization (WHO), a major player in setting the global agenda on this issue, maintains that all medically unnecessary cutting of the external female genitalia, no matter how slight, should be banned as torture and a violation of the human right to bodily integrity. However, the WHO targets only non-Western forms of female-only genital cutting, raising concerns about gender bias and cultural imperialism. Here, we summarize ongoing critiques of the WHO’s terminology, ethicolegal assumptions, and empirical claims, including the claim that non-Western FGC as such constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. To this end, we highlight recent comparative studies of medically unnecessary genital cutting of all types, including those affecting adult women and teenagers in Western societies, individuals with differences of sex development (DSD), transgender persons, and males. In so doing, we attempt to clarify the grounds for a growing critical consensus that current anti-FGM laws and policies may be ethically incoherent, empirically unsupportable, and legally unsustainable.",2021-03-01,Journal,Review,International Journal of Impotence Research,19933,21,33,Current critiques of the WHO policy on female genital mutilation,0,false,10.1038/s41443-020-0302-0,Springer Nature,349,International journal of impotence research,2020.0,175.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Comparing recent comparative studies of medically unnecessary genital cutting of all types, including those affecting adult women and teenagers in Western societies, individuals with differences of sex development (DSD), transgender persons,\xa0and males, are highlighted.'}",5400392,B.

There are limited data on participant demographic characteristics in vaccine trials despite the importance of these data to current trials aimed at preventing coronavirus disease 2019. Objective: To investigate whether racial/ethnic minority groups and female and older adults are underrepresented among participants in vaccine clinical trials. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study examined data from completed US-based vaccine trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2020. The terms vaccine, vaccination, immunization, and inoculation were used to identify trials. Only those addressing vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy of preventative vaccines were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: The numbers and percentages of racial/ethnic minority, female, and older individuals compared with US census data from 2011 and 2018. Secondary outcome measures were inclusion by trial phase and year of completion. Results: A total of 230 US-based trials with 219555 participants were included in the study. Most trials were randomized (180 [78.3%]), included viral vaccinations (159 [69.1%]), and represented all trial phases. Every trial reported age and sex; 134 (58.3%) reported race and 79 (34.3%) reported ethnicity. Overall, among adult study participants, White individuals were overrepresented (77.9%; 95% CI, 77.4%-78.4%), and Black or African American individuals (10.6%; 95% CI, 10.2%-11.0%) and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-0.5%) were underrepresented compared with US census data; enrollment of Asian individuals was similar (5.7%; 95% CI, 5.5%-6.0%). Enrollment of Hispanic or Latino individuals (11.6%; 95% CI, 11.1%-12.0%) was also low even among the limited number of adult trials reporting ethnicity. Adult trials were composed of more female participants (75325 [56.0%]), but among those reporting age as a percentage, enrollment of participants who were aged 65 years or older was low (12.1%; 95% CI, 12.0%-12.3%). Black or African American participants (10.1%; 95% CI, 9.7%-10.6%) and Hispanic or Latino participants (22.5%; 95% CI, 21.6%-23.4%) were also underrepresented in pediatric trials. Among trials reporting race/ethnicity, 65 (48.5%) did not include American Indian or Alaska Native participants and 81 (60.4%) did not include Hawaiian or Pacific Islander participants.

355,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.(1) Background: Gender-based violence has no geographical, personal, or social boundaries. It constitutes a serious public health problem that affects the entire society. This research aims to identify and compare the level of ambivalent sexism in Spanish and Colombian university students and its relationship with sociodemographic factors. Ambivalent sexism, developed by Glick and Fiske (1996), is considered a new type of sexism since, for the first time, it combines negative and positive feelings that give rise to hostile and benevolent sexism, maintaining the subordination of women through punishment and rewards. (2) Methods: The methodology consisted of the application of the validated Spanish version of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) to a sample of 374 students in their final academic year of the Law program, of which 21.7% were students at the University of Santander (Bucaramanga, Colombia), 45.5% at the University Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain), and the remaining 32.9% at the University of Seville (Seville, Spain). (3) Results: A high level of ambivalent sexism is reported in Colombian students nowadays. In the two countries. there are similarities (e.g., the great weight of religion and the variation in attitudes towards sexism in people who identify themselves as women, compared to male or students consulted that prefer not to answer) and differences (e.g., absence in Colombia of gender-specific legislation, low number of students who have received gender education in Spain). (4) Conclusions: These findings may contribute to the construction of laws that take into account the particular problems of women and the development of educational programs on gender that are offered in a transversal and permanent way and that take into account cultural factors and equity between men and women as an essential element in the training of future judges who have the legal responsibility to protect those who report gender violence.",2021-02-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,2,18,Assessment of ambivalent sexism in university students in colombia and spain: A comparative analysis,1,true,10.3390/ijerph18031009,MDPI AG,355,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2021.0,85.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The level of ambivalent sexism in Spanish and Colombian university students and its relationship with sociodemographic factors may contribute to the construction of laws that take into account the particular problems of women and the development of educational programs on gender.'}",2047656715,A.

To date, the degree of influence that gender has on equid intestinal microbiota has not been reported. Thus, microbiota was analyzed in feces of seven female Przewalski's horses (FRPHs) and seven male Przewalski's horses (MRPHs) in this study, determining which microbiota characteristics respond to gender biases. The microbial community composition and structure were explored by 16S rRNA sequencing, followed by diversity analysis and difference analysis. Female Przewalski's horses showed higher Shannon diversity than MRPHs, no difference in Simpson diversity, and displayed difference in beta diversity. Although gender had little effect on the overall microbiota, it significantly changed the dominant microbial community in each classification level. Male Przewalski's horses contained significantly higher amounts of microorganisms related with diseases, including spirochetes (phylum), deltaproteobacteria (class), fibrobacteria (class), spirochaetia (class), desulfovibrionales (order), fibrobacterales (order), spirochaetales (order), and spirochaetaceae (family). Female Przewalski's horses showed less than MRPHs in the top 10 genera.

Previous results suggest that strategy use is a strong individual difference that represents a broad distinction in the way that information is processed that goes beyond deductive reasoning. In 3 studies, we examined if this model could predict individual differences in the processing of social information by examining socially relevant cognitive biases. Study 1 found that strategy use predicted the extent of the self-serving bias. Study 2 found that strategy use predicted use of racist stereotypes even when need for closure was accounted for. Study 3 found that an essentialist prime resulted in a higher level of gender bias among statistical reasoners but that this prime had no effect on counterexample reasoners. These results indicate that the processing distinction between the 2 reasoning strategies underlies individual differences in social biases such as stereotypes, sexism, and racism.

Identification of factors impacting provider ordering and patient completion of testing may guide strategies to improve screening. Objective: To evaluate predictors of hemoglobin A1c (A1c)-based T2D screening in pediatric primary care. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 10 to 18 year-old patients with overweight/obesity (body mass index [BMI] Z-score ≥1.04) followed in a large academic-affiliated pediatric primary care network, 2009 to 2018. Percentages of patients with ordered and completed A1c were determined, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate independent predictors of screening. Results: 34 927 (48.0% female; 52.5% with BMI Z-score ≥1.64) youth followed for a median of 3.0 years were included. 21% (7457) of patients had screening ordered and 14% (4966) completed screening during follow-up. In multivariable regression, after controlling for race/ethnicity, BMI, family history of diabetes and age, males were significantly less likely to have ordered screening, but were equally or more likely to complete screening if ordered. Conclusions: Male adolescents were less likely to undergo A1c-based T2D screening due to differential ordering practices. The source of this differential practice should be pursued to avoid under-recognition of cardiometabolic risk in at-risk male youth.",2021-02-01,Journal,Article,Pediatric Obesity,21100201916,1,16,Sex-based differences in screening and recognition of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in pediatric primary care,2,,10.1111/ijpo.12699,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,359,Pediatric obesity,2020.0,26.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Risk‐based screening for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth with overweight/obesity is recommended, but rates remain low in practice.'}",7390238,M.

360,"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The widespread propagation of beauty ideals has made their influence inescapable for women worldwide. Numerous studies have suggested the negative consequences of the internalization of beauty ideals. However, researchers have mostly focused on Western cultures, with only a few studies addressing China. Given that Chinese traditional Confucian values emphasize more reproduction and family duties of women, women suffer more pressures in China. However, not all women experience and respond to cultural practices in the same way. The present study aimed to examine the mechanism underlying the link between the internalization of beauty ideals and ambivalent sexism and the differences in this link among subgroups of Chinese women. Data were collected from a sample of 293 (146 heterosexual women, 147 sexual minority women). The results showed that the associations of the internalization of beauty ideals with hostile sexism and benevolent sexism were mediated by the objectification of women. Furthermore, the link between the internalization of beauty ideals and the objectification of women depended on women’s sexual orientation. More specifically, for lesbian and bisexual women but not heterosexual women, the internalization of beauty ideals was positively associated with the objectification of women. The present study addressed a major gap by examining how and for whom the internalization of beauty ideals was associated with increased hostile sexism and benevolent sexism among Chinese women. Sociocultural factors and implications are discussed.",2021-02-01,Journal,Article,Archives of Sexual Behavior,27562,5,50,"Examining the Links Between Beauty Ideals Internalization, the Objectification of Women, and Ambivalent Sexism Among Chinese Women: The Effects of Sexual Orientation",0,false,10.1007/s10508-020-01718-7,Springer,360,Archives of Sexual Behavior,2020.0,53.0,0.0,,2149551453,Lijuan Xiao,2155602563,Fang Wang,,,,,,,,,11.0,50.0,4.0,6.0,20.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
361,"© 2019 American Psychological AssociationThe unique experiences of women with serious mental illness (SMI) are often overlooked in the literature in mental health and rehabilitation services. This population faces increased risk of violence, sexual abuse, treatment bias, and a number of health problems when compared with their male counterparts. Further research is needed to identify these differences and suggest clinical implications for working with women with SMI. The present qualitative research includes data from a grounded theory study analyzing interviews with 20 women with SMI to explore their treatment experiences with mental health providers. The following themes pertaining to treatment experiences of women with SMI were generated from qualitative analysis: diminishing dismissals (questions as to the legitimacy of the symptoms and concerns of women with SMI in their mental health treatment), symptom misattribution (erroneous ascriptions of their mental health symptoms), male mistrust (wariness toward, and avoidance of, male providers), psychiatric insults (perceptions that mental health providers tend to make stigmatizing diagnoses), doomsday predictions (experience of providers’ negative prognoses of their future), and diagnostic reordering (tendency of mental health providers to revise prior diagnoses of women with SMI in ways that reduce stigma and build trust). Clinical implications of these findings will be discussed, including the need for enhanced awareness of providers as to the perceptions and expectations of gender bias in treatment among women with SMI.

All rights reserved.Objectives In line with the child survival and gender equality targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3 and 5, we aimed to: (1) estimate the age and sex-specific mortality trends in child-related SDG indicators (ie, neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and under-five mortality rate (U5MR)) over the 1960s-2017 period, and (2) estimate the expected annual reduction rates needed to achieve the SDG-3 targets by projecting rates from 2018 to 2030. Design Group method of data handling-type artificial neural network (GMDH-type ANN) time series. Methods This study used an artificial intelligence time series (GMDH-type ANN) to forecast age-specific childhood mortality rates (neonatal and under-five) and sex-specific U5MR from 2018 to 2030. The data sets were the yearly historical mortality rates between 1960s and 2017, obtained from the World Bank website. Two scenarios of mortality trajectories were simulated: (1) status quo scenarios- A ssuming the current trend continues; and (2) acceleration scenarios-consistent with the SDG targets. Results At the projected rates of decline of 2.0% for NMR and 1.2% for U5MR, Nigeria will not achieve the child survival SDG targets by 2030. Unexpectedly, U5MR will begin to increase by 2028. To put Nigeria back on track, annual reduction rates of 7.8% for NMR and 10.7% for U5MR are required. Also, female U5MR is decreasing more slowly than male U5MR. At the end of SDG era, female deaths will be higher than male deaths (80.9 vs 62.6 deaths per 1000 live births). Conclusion Nigeria is not likely to achieve SDG targets for child survival and gender equities because female disadvantages will worsen. A plausible reason for the projected increase in female mortality is societal discrimination and victimisation faced by female child. Stakeholders in Nigeria need to adequately plan for child health to achieve SDG targets by 2030.

Through a case study of Australian Women’s Big Bash cricket team the ‘Sydney Sixers’, this chapter explores how women’s cricket was experienced on match-day by fans, as well as perceptions of the value and quality of attending women’s professional cricket. We first undertook participant observation at matches to understand how women’s cricket was delivered, experienced and engaged with by fans.

The priority of the study is implementing a system of criteria for gender stereotypes of appearance, taking into account the system of socio-psychological factors and gender-oriented forms of prevention of overcoming sexism and discrimination on the grounds of personality attractiveness. It is substantiated that social evaluation through physical criteria creates several psychological problems because the ""physical self"" is an essential component of the ""selfconcept"" and one of the criteria of self-esteem. It is proved that the properties of gender stereotypes coincide with the social ones. They are the bearer of emotional and evaluative characteristics, taking into account the group of values associated with the ambivalence of ideas about another. A methodical approach to the assessment of gender stereotypes of appearance and personality is proposed, which allows determining the criteria of human well-being, taking into account discrimination factors, intrapersonal parameters of affective-negative perception of one's appearance and self-concept, as well as the aesthetic perception of identity. An assessment of socio-psychological factors of gender stereotypes of appearance, which is based on the methodological provisions of psychoanalysis and humanism, cognitive paradigm, dispositional theory, cross-cultural approach, and some sociological studies, is carried out. As an experiment on empirical verification of the stereotypes of appearance, their gender differences, and socio-psychological factors, a set of methods of psychological diagnosis is used, which allow determining indicators of stereotypes of appearance, selfesteem, and attitude to beauty; socio-psychological criteria for the formation of gender stereotypes of appearance.

Multivariate moderated multiple regressions (MMMR) linked military hypermasculinity facets (Machiavellian desire for status and control; conformity to masculine norms including emotional control, violence tolerance, needing to win, and impersonal sex preference; hostile and benevolent sexism) to performance outcomes including academics, leadership, and fitness; perceptions of peers, leadership, and antibias programming; and behavior. Desire for status, impersonal sex preference, violence tolerance, and benevolent sexism predicted negative performance outcomes. Violence tolerance, emotional control, and hostile sexism were associated with poorer perception of character education and/or anti-bias programming. Needing to win and control were associated with positive performance outcomes.

While there has been a great deal of feminist work dedicated to analysing the social, cultural, political, and institutional effects of misogyny, the ancillary theories of misogyny these analyses produce are only ever partial, fragmented, vague or conceptually inconsistent. This article engages and critiques these theories by focusing on three separate but related issues within existing feminist scholarship on misogyny: the conflation of misogyny with sexism, the elision of misogyny's affective elements and the supplanting of misogyny with gendered violence. Through my identification and critique of these issues, I argue that misogyny should be understood as a profoundly complicated and emotional social dynamic. Moreover, I argue that to attempt to cleanse misogyny of its affective/emotional complexity or conflate misogyny with sexism and/or violence is to rob theorists of possible loci of apprehension and intervention.

383,"© The Author.While prototypical uses of slurs express contempt for targets, some reclaimed uses are associated with positive evaluations. This practice may raise concerns. I anticipate this criticism in what I dub the Warrant Argument (WA) and then defend the legitimacy of this kind of reclamation. For the WA, standard pejorative uses of slurs are problematic for assuming unwarranted connections between descriptive properties (e.g., being gay) and value judgements (e.g., being worthy of contempt). When reclaimed uses of slurs express a positive evaluation of their targets—the WA goes—reclamation fails to challenge the unwarranted link between descriptive properties and value judgements, and merely reverses the evaluation polarity from negative to positive. So, the WA concludes, reclaimed uses of slurs evaluating targets positively for belonging to a certain group make a similar moral error as derogatory uses of slurs (sections 2-3). The WA could lead us to condemn reclamation. To resist this conclusion, I draw a parallel with affirmative action, arguing that it can be morally permissible to balance an existing form of injustice by temporarily introducing a countervailing mechanism that prima facie seems to violate the norm of equality: even if the WA were right, it wouldn’t constitute an argument against the moral permissibility of reclamation in the case of most slurs (section 4). This line of argument in defense of pride reclamation may also serve to debunk the myths of reverse racism and reverse sexism (section 5).",2021-01-01,Journal,Conference Paper,Organon F,5800208085,1,28,The moral status of the reclamation of slurs,1,true,10.31577/ORGF.2021.28309,Slovak Academy of Sciences - Inst of Philosophy,383,Organon F,2021.0,0.0,0.0,,52369097,Bianca Cepollaro,,,,,,,,,,,31.0,180.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science

Even after adjusting for age, experience, work hours, productivity, and academic rank, the gender gap remained and widened over the course of a physician's career. This study aimed to examine if a significant gender pay gap still existed for anesthesiologists in the United States. METHODS: In 2018, we surveyed 28,812 physician members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists to assess the association of compensation with gender and to identify possible causes of wage disparities. Gender was the primary variable examined in the model, and compensation by gender was the primary outcome. Compensation was defined as the amount reported as direct compensation on a W-2, 1099, or K-1, plus all voluntary salary reductions (eg, 401[k], health insurance). The survey directed respondents to include salary, bonuses, incentive payments, research stipends, honoraria, and distribution of profits to employees. Respondents had the option of providing a point estimate of their compensation or selecting a range in $50,000 increments. Potential confounding variables that could affect compensation were identified based on a scoping literature review and the consensus expertise of the authors. We fitted a generalized ordinal logistic regression with 7 ranges of compensation. For the sensitivity analyses, we used linear regressions of log-transformed compensation based on respondent point estimates and imputed values. RESULTS: The final analytic sample consisted of 2081 observations (response rate, 7.2%). This sample represented a higher percentage of women and younger physicians compared to the demographic makeup of anesthesiologists in the United States. The adjusted odds ratio associated with gender equal to woman was an estimated 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.53), indicating that for a given compensation range, women had a 56% lower odds than men of being in a higher compensation range. Sensitivity analyses found the relative percentage difference in compensation for women compared to men ranged from -8.3 to -8.9. In the sensitivity analysis based on the subset of respondents (n = 1036) who provided a point estimate of compensation, the relative percentage difference (-8.3%; 95% confidence interval, -4.7 to -11.7) reflected a $32,617 lower compensation for women than men, holding other covariates at their means.

This limits what we know about variables that might contribute explanation as to why some women deliberately lie about having been assaulted. In our survey of 255 women (both college students and community members), 18 admitted they had fictitiously claimed to have been assaulted either to official investigators, or to friends and family members. Their stated motives included revenge, fear, and embarrassment. Our participants also rated the extent to which they could imagine a situation in which they would make a(nother) false claim in the future—101 (39.6%) of them rated this item positively to differing degrees. We also examined individual difference variables including the ‘dark triad’ traits and four measures of sexist beliefs.

The analysis encompasses 11-years of activity, across levels of expertise, language, and specialism, to assess if Stack Overflow is really a paradise for programmers. I first examine individual users, asking if there are gender differences in key user metrics of success, focusing on reputation points, user tenure, and level of activity. Second, I test if there are gender-biases in how technical knowledge is recognised in the question-answer format of the platform. Third, using social network analysis I investigate if interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender. Results show that sharing and recognising technical knowledge is dictated by users’ gender, even when it is operationalised beyond a binary. I find that feminine users receive lower scores for their answers, despite exhibiting higher effort in their contributions. I also show that interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender.

407,"© Oxford University Press 2021.The political context producing the Donald Trump presidency put into stark relief the confusion, feelings of victimization, and rage of some constituencies that voted for him. Enraged, Rattled, and Wronged: Entitlement’s Response to Social Progress explores the role of entitlement in fostering inequality in the United States. Scholars and activists in recent decades have correctly incorporated the topic of privilege into discussions of prejudice and discrimination. White privilege, male privilege, heterosexual privilege, and class privilege exemplify the unearned advantages given to socially preferred groups-advantages not enjoyed by marginalized groups. As a result, activists and scholars of prejudice integrate an examination of discrimination against target groups, alongside the corresponding benefits that come to those viewed as the societal norm and ideal (e.g., Whites, heterosexuals, and men). Enraged, Rattled, and Wronged examines psychological entitlement as an overlooked but essential feature of persistent inequality. Psychological entitlement refers to one’s sense of deservingness. In understanding resistance to social progress we must understand how members of advantaged groups come to understand their belief in their own worthiness relative to those in disadvantaged groups. The task of this project is an urgent inquiry given our current political context: What happens to entitled people when they feel pushed aside? What are they willing to tear down as they scramble to keep their grip on relative status and power?

Comparison of arithmetical averages reports statistically significant differences in the internalization of romantic love according to sex, partner tenure, educational course, religiosity and pornography consumption. Finally, regression analyses indicate that the myths of the Love-Maltreatment association dimension are influenced by hostile sexism, and myths of the Idealization of Love dimension are influenced by sex, religiosity, partner tenure and benevolent sexism.

This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinicopathological significance of RBMS3 in breast cancer. Methods: A total of 998 breast cancer tissue samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database with survival outcomes were divided into high RBMS3 expression and low expression groups using the median as the cutoff. Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were compared between the 2 groups. Results: TCGA showed that RBMS3 mRNA was downregulated in breast cancer tissues, and RBMS3 downregulation was correlated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry staining of 127 paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues showed that RBMS3 protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus; however, nuclear staining was present in 90.0% of normal breast tissues but only 28.3% of breast cancer tissues. Decreased RBMS3 protein expression was significantly correlated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative status and death at final follow-up. Patients with lower RBMS3 protein expression had substantially shorter survival than those with higher RBMS3 expression. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that the combination of RBMS3 expression and ER status (a variable designated as “cofactor”) was an independent prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.420, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.223-0.791, P = 0.007).

415,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.In addition to studies focused on estrogen mediation of sex-different regulation of systemic circulations, there is now increasing clinical relevance and research interests in the pulmonary circulation, in terms of sex differences in the morbidity and mortality of lung diseases such as inherent-, allergic- and inflammatory-based events. Thus, female predisposition to pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an inevitable topic. To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs). As a susceptible target of estrogen, Ephx2/sEH expression is downregulated by an estrogen-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Increases in pulmonary EETs then evoke a potentiation of PAH generation, but mitigation of its progression, a phenomenon similar to the estrogen-paradox regulation of PAH. Additionally, the female susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Sect. 7.3) and asthma (Sect.7.4), but less preference to COVID-19 (Sect. 7.5), and roles of estrogen in their pathogeneses are briefly discussed.",2021-01-01,Book Series,Book Chapter,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,26761,1,1303,"Roles of Genetic Predisposition in the Sex Bias of Pulmonary Pathophysiology, as a Function of Estrogens: Sex Matters in the Prevalence of Lung Diseases",0,false,10.1007/978-3-030-63046-1_7,Springer,415,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,2021.0,186.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling.'}",144230282,A.

418,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.Sexism and feminism are often seen as opposing belief systems on a single dimension in American politics. Gender scholars, however, have noticed that these forces are not equal and opposite. The 2016 election represents a critical case for examining how gender-related attitudes and identities push and pull voters. Hillary Clinton was the first female presidential nominee of a major party and a self-proclaimed feminist facing an opponent considered by many to be hostile to women. As such, many observers predicted a substantial increase in the gender gap. However, the gap did not widen much compared to previous races, and nearly half of women chose Trump. Why? We argue that sexism – as commonly measured – mixes attitudes about women in general with those about feminists in particular. When feminism becomes salient, as in 2016, attitudes about this subgroup become more relevant to the vote. Relying on three studies – a 2016 survey on SSI, the 2018 CCES, and the 2016 ANES, we assess the role of anti-feminist attitudes and feminist identity across gender, race, and party. We find that sexism directed against feminists powerfully dampened support for Clinton across genders. However, feminist identity was much less common in the electorate, and had little effect on men’s votes. Thus, although countervailing, these two forces are not equivalent. In 2016, the benefit of appealing to feminists was overwhelmed by the cost of activating voters who intensely dislike the group. These results reveal a consequential imbalance in the power of sexism and feminism in U.S. politics.",2021-01-01,Journal,Article,Political Behavior,22832,2,,The Electoral Costs and Benefits of Feminism in Contemporary American Politics,0,false,10.1007/s11109-021-09692-z,Springer,418,,2021.0,68.0,0.0,,115675303,Marzia Oceno,9770761,Nicholas A.

However, multiple professional societies have rec-ognized that most undergraduate biochemistry students acquire only a surface-level understanding of metabolism. We hypothesized that guiding students through interactive computer simulations of metabolic systems would increase their ability to recognize how individual interactions between components affect the behavior of a system under different conditions. The computer simulations were designed with an interactive activity (i.e., module) that used the predict–observe–explain model of instruction to guide students through a process in which they iteratively predict outcomes, test their predictions, modify the interactions of the system, and then retest the outcomes. We found that biochemistry students using modules performed better on metabolism questions compared with students who did not use the modules. The average learning gain was 8% with modules and 0% without modules, a small to medium effect size. We also confirmed that the modules did not create or reinforce a gender bias.

Materials and Methods: The National Survey of American Life (NSAL) used a slightly modified version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI) with a sample of 6082 participants. We also assess intraracial group differences based on ethnicity and nativity status (U.S.-born African American, U.S.-born Caribbean Black, and foreign-born Caribbean Black). Results: The study provides evidence that severe physical intimate partner violence (SPIPV) is a significant threat to the mental health of U.S. Black women. Bivariate and multivariate analyses indicate that those with a history of SPIPV were at greater risk for mental disorders than women who did not experience violence by a spouse or partner. Racial discrimination was associated with higher odds of anxiety and substance disorders, whereas gender discrimination was associated with higher odds of mood disorders. Neighborhood drug problems also increased the odds of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Older age and being an Afro-Caribbean immigrant were associated with lower odds of three of four mental disorders.

We examine the underlying process that leads women and men to feel ostracized and less motivated when sexist language is used. Results show that the use of sexist language has a negative impact on feelings of ostracism and motivation for both women and men. This can be explained by various motivational processes: intrapersonal (identification with the task or the job), interpersonal (feelings of belonging) and intergroup (perceived discrimination). We find no impact of participants’ gender on these effects, although girls show more negative attitudes than boys towards exclusive language.

430,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdBackground: Gender bias in measures of cannabis problems may differentially affect how men and women endorse items. This gender invariance might mask, exaggerate, or otherwise obscure true distinctions in experiences of cannabis consequences. Methods: The Cannabis-Associated Problems Questionnaire (CAPQ), a measure of interpersonal deficits, occupational impairment, psychological issues, and physical side effects related to cannabis use, contained items with gender-based differential item functioning (DIF) in previous work—a finding we aim to replicate and extend (Lavender, Looby, & Earleywine, 2008). Results: In a sample of 4053 cannabis users, gender differences were apparent in global scores on the CAPQ. A DIF analysis revealed two gender-biased items, including one identified previously. Removal of these items did not significantly alter the scale's relation to cannabis use. Gender differences on the CAPQ persisted after removal of the two problematic items, indicating true gender differences still exist in men and women's experiences of cannabis-related consequences. Gender appeared to significantly contribute to scores on the full CAPQ and the short-form of the CAPQ with biased item removed, even after controlling for indices of cannabis use. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the CAPQ evidences less gender bias than previously thought, perhaps due to diminishing gender-based stereotypes.

432,"© 2020 American Psychological AssociationObjective: The present study aimed to characterize the association of perceived gender discrimination and illicit drug use among a sample of African American (AA) and European American (EA) adolescent girls and young women. Method: Data were drawn from a high-risk family study of alcohol use disorder of mothers and their offspring (N = 735). Multinomial regressions were used to examine whether experience of offspring and maternal gender discrimination were associated with offspring illicit drug use (cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, PCP, opiates, hallucinogens, solvents, sedatives, or inhalants). Outcomes included offspring age of drug use initiation (age ≤ 14) and lifetime heavy drug use (≥ 50 times) of 1 or more illicit substances. Interactions between race and offspring gender discrimination were modeled to assess for race differences. Results: Results revealed that gender discrimination was associated with a greater likelihood of offspring early initiation (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 2.57, 95% CI [1.31, 5.03]) versus later initiation (RRR = 1.33, 95% CI [0.80, 2.24]). Offspring gender discrimination was associated with offspring heavy drug use (RRR = 2.09, 95% CI [1.07, 4.06]) and not associated with moderate/light use (RRR = 1.44, 95% CI [0.86, 2.42]), but post hoc tests revealed no significant group differences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that perceived offspring gender discrimination is associated with early drug use initiation. Gender discrimination, particularly at an early age, has a potential to cause harm, including drug use. Implementation of policies that foster environments that eliminate gender bias and discrimination at an early age should be prioritized. Gender-responsive treatment merits consideration by substance use treatment providers. Public Significance Statement: This study indicates that adolescent females who experience gender discrimination, are more likely to initiate drugs at an earlier age. Targeting gender discrimination during adolescence may be important, before gender norms become rooted into one’s trajectory.

The present study aims to examine how male and female characters are represented in the readers for the Primary Literacy Programme–Reading and Writing developed by the Education Bureau in Hong Kong, from experiential and relational perspectives. Variables such as the ratios of female-to-male appearances and central characters, the familial roles and activities performed, character identification, and order of mention were examined through manual and/or computational research methods. The findings show that although there is numerical gender balance, latent gender inequality still exists. It is recommended that book authors, publishers, and education authorities consider how to avoid creating hidden gender inequities, either consciously or unconsciously, while teachers and parents should be provided with guidelines on how to help children develop critical reading skills to interpret gender, and how to “subvert” stereotypes when reading and telling stories to children.",2021-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Research in Childhood Education,4700152821,1,35,Gender Portrayal in a Popular Hong Kong Reading Programme for Children: Are There Equalities?,0,false,10.1080/02568543.2020.1784323,Routledge,433,Journal of Research in Childhood Education,2020.0,56.0,0.0,,2108598929,Jackie F.

434,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Online social networks allow powerless people to gain enormous amounts of control over particular people's lives and profit from the anonymity or social distance that the Internet provides in order to harass other people. One of the most frequently targeted groups comprise women, as misogyny is, unfortunately, a reality in our society. However, although great efforts have recently been made to identify misogyny, it is still difficult to distinguish as it can sometimes be very subtle and deep, signifying that the use of statistical approaches is not sufficient. Moreover, as Spanish is spoken worldwide, context and cultural differences can complicate this identification. Our contribution to the detection of misogyny in Spanish is two-fold. On the one hand, we apply Sentiment Analysis and Social Computing technologies for detecting misogynous messages in Twitter. On the other, we have compiled the Spanish MisoCorpus-2020, a balanced corpus regarding misogyny in Spanish, and classified it into three subsets concerning (1) violence towards relevant women, (2) messages harassing women in Spanish from Spain and Spanish from Latin America, and (3) general traits related to misogyny. Our proposal combines a classification based on average word embeddings and linguistic features in order to understand which linguistic phenomena principally contribute to the identification of misogyny. We have evaluated our proposal with three machine-learning classifiers, achieving the best accuracy of 85.175%.

However, to date, no known empirical research has explored the consequences of exposure to humor that criticizes, confronts, and questions sexism (i.e., subversive humor against sexism or feminist humor). In the present research, we conducted two experiments to analyze the impact of exposure to subversive humor against sexism (vs. neutral humor) on the degree of involvement in collective action for gender equality, taking into account the feminist identity of participants. The results of Study 1 (n = 135) revealed that Spanish women and men with weaker feminist identification showed a higher proclivity to participate in collective action for gender equality after being exposed to subversive humor against sexism (vs. neutral humor). Study 2 (n = 134 Spanish women and men) replicated these results and expanded them to behavioral intentions to participate in this type of collective action. Our findings show the potential implications of using this type of humor for collective action for gender equality. Overall, subversive humor against sexism may function as a supportive tool to combat sexist attitudes, discrimination against women, and gender inequality by raising awareness in people with lower feminist identity to get them more involved in collective action.

Moreover, being considered as platforms for organizing grass root political movements or political participation in general, this positive view has given way to more critical perspectives on the negative sides of social media, such as attempts of algorithmically manipulating public opinion or the outcome of elections and racist or sexist hate speech.

Most recently, the criterion has turned to testosterone. Specifically, if a woman naturally produces testosterone that registers in what sport authorities consider an ‘unnatural’ range, she must suppress that testosterone to compete in women’s events. The testosterone threshold will undoubtedly expand to include cis, intersex, and trans sportswomen, despite their respective and significant differences. Taken together, these types of regulations are confusing and contradictory, quite possibly sexist, and most assuredly ‘wicked’, as Rittel and Webber formulated with regard to ‘wicked problems’.

IPV was categorized as psychological aggression, physical injury, physical assault, and sexual coercion and was measured using the revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2), an eight-item scale measuring cold violence that was designed specifically for this study. Controlling behaviors were measured using a 34-item scale that was designed for this study, and sexist attitudes toward women and men were assessed using the short forms of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) and the Ambivalence toward Men Inventory (AMI), respectively. Participants (N = 272) reported instances of perpetration of or victimization by IPV and controlling behaviors within the past 6 months and indicated ambivalent sexism (hostile attitude toward men and women and benevolent attitude toward men and women [HM, HS, BM, and BS, respectively]). Almost 47.1% of the participants reported an experience of IPV, and the prevalence of cold violence and controlling behaviors was found to be 65.1% and 80.5%, respectively. Psychological aggression was the most common, followed sequentially by sexual coercion, physical assault, and injury in present study. We found a strong association between perpetration and victimization and that different forms of violence tend to co-occur in both IPV and controlling behaviors.

The objective of this study was to analyze female authorship trends in arthroplasty research from 2002 to 2019.Methods:Articles published from 2002 to 2019 in 12 clinical orthopaedic and arthroplasty journals were extracted from PubMed. Articles that provided the full name of the first author and contained the terms ""arthroplasty,""""hip replacement,""""knee replacement,""or ""joint replacement""in the title and/or as keywords were analyzed. The gender of the author was determined with the validated Genderize algorithm, and publication trends were analyzed over time. Descriptive and comparative statistics were computed, and logistic regression was used to evaluate gender trends.Results:From 2002 to 2019, 14,692 articles met the inclusion criteria, and the gender of 63,628 authors was identified. There were 23,626 unique authors; 4,003 (16.9%) were women and 19,623 (83.1%) were men. Female involvement in arthroplasty publications increased from 11.1% in 2002 to 12.6% in 2019 (p < 0.001), and the percentage of female first authors increased from 5.0% in 2002 to 11.3% in 2019 (p < 0.001). Critically, however, the proportion of women as senior authors significantly declined from 8.5% in 2002 to 6.2% in 2019 (p < 0.001). From our analysis of U.S. publications with physician senior authors, the proportion of female senior authors remained relatively stable from 1.7% in 2002 to 2.4% in 2019 without a significantly increasing trend (p = 0.88). Overall, on average, women published a mean (and 95% confidence interval) of 1.9 ± 0.1 publications, while men published 2.9 ± 0.1 publications (p < 0.001).

Recently, the extended crosswise model has been proposed as an improvement over the original crosswise model. It offers all of the advantages of the original crosswise model while also enabling the detection of systematic response biases. We applied the extended crosswise model to a new sensitive attribute, campus islamophobia, and present the first experimental investigation including an extended crosswise model, and a direct questioning control condition, respectively. In a paper-pencil questionnaire, we surveyed 1,361 German university students using either a direct question or the extended crosswise model. We found that the extended crosswise model provided a good model fit, indicating no systematic response bias and allowing for a pooling of the data of both groups of the extended crosswise model. Moreover, the extended crosswise model yielded significantly higher estimates of campus Islamophobia than a direct question. This result could either indicate that the extended crosswise model was successful in controlling for social desirability, or that response biases such as false positives or careless responding have inflated the estimate, which cannot be decided on the basis of the available data.

The widespread belief that weight is a matter of personal will and self-control results in various weight-based stereotypes (e.g., laziness, lack of self-discipline, or neglect). Objective: Based on the modified version of the Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS-M), a short form for the economic assessment of weight bias internalization in the general population was compiled and validated. Methods: A three-item short form (WBIS-3) was derived based on data from a representative sample of the German population (n = 1,092). This new short form was validated in a second representative population sample (n = 2,513). Item characteristics and internal consistency were obtained. Measurement invariance was tested. Construct validity was established via the correlation with theoretically related constructs (depression, anxiety, eating behavior, discrimination, weight status). To establish scale validity, all analyses were performed for the whole sample as well as for the subsample of individuals with overweight. Age- and gender-specific population norms were provided. Results: The WBIS-3 exhibited excellent psychometric properties. Internal consistency was α = 0.92. Strong measurement invariance was confirmed regarding age, gender, discrimination, and weight status in both the whole sample as well as the overweight subsample.

Here, we report that circGRIA1, a conserved circRNA isoform derived from the genomic loci of α-mino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit Gria1, shows an age-related and male-specific increase in expression in the rhesus macaque prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We show circGRIA1 is predominantly localized to the nucleus, and find an age-related increase in its association with the promoter region of Gria1 gene, suggesting it has a regulatory role in Gria1 transcription. In vitro and in vivo manipulation of circGRIA1 negatively regulates Gria1 mRNA and protein levels.

449,"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Based on research suggesting that alcohol consumption can be used as a means of coping with negative affect (Cooper et al. 1995), the current study examines sexism as a factor in college women’s alcohol consumption. Despite being more prevalent than hostile sexism, benevolent sexism is often viewed as less sexist (Oswald et al. 2018) and having a less aversive impact on women (Bosson et al. 2010). To increase understanding of the negative effects of both hostile and benevolent sexism, the current study experimentally manipulated sexism during a lab session and measured 176 U.S. college women’s actual alcohol consumption that evening. As predicted, college women who experienced either the hostile or the benevolent sexism condition reported consuming a greater number of alcoholic drinks, and those in the hostile sexism condition were more likely to meet the binge drinking threshold than participants in the control condition. This pattern suggests the importance of examining the unique effects of benevolent sexism in addition to hostile sexism because both may influence women’s behavior even in important health domains. Given the many negative consequences associated with alcohol consumption, our results provide evidence for education on healthy coping mechanisms and interventions to reduce both hostile and benevolent sexism.",2020-12-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,3,83,Cheers to Equality!

All versions of this article have been corrected.] In the United States, God is commonly conceptualized as the omnipotent and omniscient entity that created the universe, and as a White man. We questioned whether the extent to which God is conceptualized as a White man predicts the extent to which White men are perceived as particularly fit for leadership. We found support for this across 7 studies. In Study 1, we created 2 measures to examine the extent to which U.S. Christians conceptualized God as a White man, and in Study 2 we found that, controlling for multiple covariates (e.g., racist and sexist attitudes, religiosity, political attitudes), responses on these measures predicted perceiving White male job candidates as particularly fit for leadership, among both Black and White, male and female, Christians. In Study 3, we found that U.S. Christian children, both White and racial minority, conceptualized God as more White than Black (and more male than female), which predicted perceiving White people as particularly boss-like. We next found evidence to suggest that this phenomenon is rooted in broader intuitions that extend beyond Christianity. That is, in a novel context with novel groups and a novel god, U.S. Christian adults (Studies 4 and 6), atheist adults (Study 5), and agnostic preschoolers (Study 7), used a god's identity to infer which groups were best fit for leadership.

However, the definition of the profile of this type of victim still presents numerous unknowns that hinder the effectiveness of prevention programs against violence. This study analyzes the interaction of cognitive, emotional and behavioral variables that converge in the victim profile. The sample comprised 2577 adolescents (55.2% girls) of 14 to 18 years in age (M = 15.9, SD = 1.2). The instruments used were the dating violence questionnaire (CUVINO), the scale of detection of sexism in adolescents (DSA), Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement Scale and Child and Adolescent Disposition Scale (CADS). To study the relationship between the different variables considered in this article, a SEM analysis was used.

453,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe freedom of expression given by social media has a dark side: the growing proliferation of abusive contents on these platforms. Misogynistic speech is a kind of abusive language, which can be simplified as hate speech targeting women, and it is becoming a more and more relevant issue in recent years. AMI IberEval 2018 and AMI EVALITA 2018 were two shared tasks which mainly focused on tackling the problem of misogyny in Twitter, in three different languages, namely English, Italian, and Spanish. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on the phenomena of misogyny in those three languages, by focusing on three main objectives. Firstly, we investigate the most important features to detect misogyny and the issues which contribute to the difficulty of misogyny detection, by proposing a novel system and conducting a broad evaluation on this task. Secondly, we study the relationship between misogyny and other abusive language phenomena, by conducting a series of cross-domain classification experiments. Finally, we explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny in a multilingual environment, by carrying out cross-lingual classification experiments. Our system succeeded to outperform all state of the art systems in all benchmark AMI datasets both subtask A and subtask B. Moreover, intriguing insights emerged from error analysis, in particular about the interaction between different but related abusive phenomena. Based on our cross-domain experiment, we conclude that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while we experimentally found that it is different from sexism. Lastly, our cross-lingual experiments show promising results. Our proposed joint-learning architecture obtained a robust performance across languages, worth to be explored in further investigation.",2020-11-01,Journal,Article,Information Processing and Management,12689,60,57,Misogyny Detection in Twitter: a Multilingual and Cross-Domain Study,0,false,10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102360,Elsevier Ltd,453,Information Processing & Management,2020.0,89.0,7.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is concluded that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while the experimentally found that it is different from sexism, which is worth to be explored in further investigation.'}",9278845,Endang Wahyu Pamungkas,3101511,Valerio Basile,1787198,V.

454,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Gender equity in medicine and surgery has recently received widespread attention. Unlike surgical specialties that remain predominantly male, the majority of obstetrician-gynecologists have been women for nearly a decade, and women have composed the majority of trainees since the 1990s. Despite a critical mass of women, biases related to gender persist in the field. Professional and behavioral expectations of men and women gynecologists remain different for patients and workplace colleagues. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are still experienced at high rates by both trainees and obstetrician-gynecologists in practice. In addition, in other surgical fields, women gynecologic surgeons face a gender wage gap that is unexplained by differences in experience, hours worked, or subspecialty training. Academic advancement and the attainment of leadership positions remain a challenge for many women.

For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Background: Current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung cancer screening guidelines are based on smoking history and age (55-80 years). These guidelines may miss those at higher risk, even at lower exposures of smoking or younger ages, because of other risk factors such as race, family history, or comorbidity. In this study, we characterized the demographic and clinical profiles of those selected by risk-based screening criteria but were missed by USPSTF guidelines in younger (50-54 years) and older (71-80 years) age groups. Methods: We used data from the National Health Interview Survey, the CISNET Smoking History Generator, and results of logistic prediction models to simulate lifetime lung cancer risk-factor data for 100 000 individuals in the 1950-1960 birth cohorts. We calculated age-specific 6-year lung cancer risk for each individual from ages 50 to 90 years using the PLCOm2012 model and evaluated age-specific screening eligibility by USPSTF guidelines and by risk-based criteria (varying thresholds between 1.3% and 2.5%). Results: In the 1950 birth cohort, 5.4% would have been ineligible for screening by USPSTF criteria in their younger ages but eligible based on risk-based criteria. Similarly, 10.4% of the cohort would be ineligible for screening by USPSTF in older ages. Notably, high proportions of blacks were ineligible for screening by USPSTF criteria at younger (15.6%) and older (14.2%) ages, which were statistically significantly greater than those of whites (4.8% and 10.8%, respectively; P <. 001). Similar results were observed with other risk thresholds and for the 1960 cohort.

This study utilized experience sampling methodology, which involves participants reporting current experiences multiple times per day, to better understand the unique daily experiences of sexism and reactivity among women in MDMs compared to both men in MDMs and women in gender-neutral majors (GNMs). For 2 weeks, four times a day, 120 U.S. college students (40 women in MDMs, 40 men in MDMs, 40 women in GNMs) were signaled to report sexist events that occurred in the last hour, current attitudes toward fit with their major, and academic motivation. Although a majority experienced at least one sexist event during the 2 weeks, results indicated that, unexpectedly, women in MDMs did not experience more sexist events around the time they attended a major class compared to the control groups. Women in MDMs, however, were more reactive to sexism. During the same hour they reported sexism, women in MDMs (unlike students in control groups) reported lower attitudes toward fit with their major.

463,"© 2020: Editum. Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia. Murcia (Spain).Child-to-parent violence (CPV) is a type of domestic violence that has gained social and scientific visibility in recent years. The objective of this study is to analyze different forms of CPV and their relationship with two groups of variables. The first group includes gender, age, family structure, school year, academic performance, drug use, frequency of drug use and diagnosis of psychopathology. The second analyzes exposure to violence, parental warmth, self-concept, sexism, narcissism and psychopathy. The participants were 225 high school students from 14 to 20 years old, 54.7% of them girls. The CPV rates were lower than those of previous Spanish studies but similar to those in other countries.

This work is written by (a) US Government employee(s) and is in the public domain in the US.Job discrimination, a social stressor, may lead to sleep health disparities among workers; yet, limited research has examined this relationship and specific sources of job discrimination. We used a US sample of working women (n = 26,085), participants in the Sister Study (2008-2016), to examine the associations of perceived job discrimination due to sex, race, age, health conditions, and/or sexual orientation with sleep health. Cross-sectionally, linear or logistic regression models revealed that each source of job discrimination was independently associated with different sleep problems after controlling for other sources of job discrimination. Longitudinally, among participants without short sleep (<7 hours/night) at time 1 (2012-2014), age-specific job discrimination was associated with 21% increased odds of new-onset short sleep (odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.43) at time 2 (2014-2016). Among those without insomnia symptoms at time 1, race-specific job discrimination was associated with 37% increased odds of new-onset insomnia symptoms (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.75) at time 2. Sex-and health-specific job discrimination also predicted new-onset sleepiness. There were dose-response relationships such that a greater number of sources of job discrimination (≥3) was associated with greater odds of prevalent and incident sleep problems.

This study aims to explore gender differences between T2DM and employment status. Data from the Korea Health Panel Study, 2013–2015 were analyzed by distinguishingT2DM and non-diabetes (N = 11,216). The empirical model was established and the generalized two-stage least squares (2SLS) was estimated, controlling for endogeneity. A family history of diabetes, as an instrumental variable, was related to an individual’s genetic predisposition to develop diabetes. The estimated results for the 2SLS showed the interaction effects between T2DM and employment. T2DM had a statistically significant and negative effect on employment for women only. The comparison with non-diabetes showed that women with T2DM had a lower probability of employment by 51.9% (p < 0.05).

Across three studies, which together include over 20,000 participants from 23 countries, we test the hypothesis that denial (vs. acknowledgement) of gender discrimination is associated with higher subjective well-being among women (Studies 1–3), and this is because denying gender discrimination promotes the view that the system is fair (Study 1). We further show that this happens above and beyond personal experiences with sexism (Study 1) and that the association is stronger in countries where sexism is relatively high (vs. low; Study 3).

Here, we expand the focus of this phenomenon by examining it cross-culturally, to test if both individual- and country-level variables predict men's collective action intentions to support gender equality. We tested a model in which men's zero-sum beliefs about gender predict reduced collective action intentions via an increase in hostile sexism. Because country-level gender equality may threaten men's higher gender status, we also examined whether the path from zero-sum beliefs to collective action intentions was stronger in countries higher in gender equality. Multilevel modeling on 6,734 men from 42 countries supported the individual-level mediation model, but found no evidence of moderation by country-level gender equality.

468,"© 2020 The Authors. European Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThis article examines the role of organisational climate in women's social responses to sexism at work. We argue that after experiences of sexism, women “draw together” with other women when they perceive that the organisational climate is intolerant of sexism. We assess the role of organisational climate at three levels: peer-, manager-, and policy-level. We conducted a correlational study (Nstudy1 = 405) and two experimental studies (Nstudy2 = 377, Nstudy3 = 391), in which we examined women's experiences of sexism at work (measured in Study 1; manipulated in Studies 2 and 3). We also measured perceived tolerance of sexism at the peer-, manager- and policy-level in all studies. The main DVs were women's workplace friendships with other women in Studies 1 and 2, and closeness to female co-workers in Study 3. Results showed that perceived tolerance of sexism from peers was especially important in shaping women's social relationships following experiences of sexism; tolerance from managers or at the policy level had less consistent effects. Specifically, experiences with sexism were positively associated with female participants' reported friendship (Studies 1 and 2) and closeness (Study 3) with their female colleagues, but only when peers were perceived not to tolerate sexism. When peers were perceived to tolerate sexism, female participants did not respond to sexism by drawing together.",2020-10-01,Journal,Article,European Journal of Social Psychology,14117,4,50,Distancing or drawing together: Sexism and organisational tolerance of sexism impact women's social relationships at work,1,true,10.1002/ejsp.2695,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,468,,2020.0,89.0,0.0,,2049901055,Esma Esen Ciftci,3945468,M.

We first employed a diary study to explore the prevalence of FSTs in college students’ everyday life and found that this type of teasing tends to occur in social situations and often between close others. In a second study, we experimentally manipulated perceived closeness with the teaser. We predicted that individuals teased by someone with whom they shared a perceived closeness would interpret FSTs as playful fun; therefore, the tease would not have a negative psychological effect.

472,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: In order for infants and toddlers to meet recommended movement guidelines, their caregivers need to encourage play daily. This study used a qualitative approach to understand how mothers perceive and promote play and physical activity during the first 2 years of life. Methods: Mothers with children between 0 and 24 months were recruited from the SAMRC/Wits Developmental Pathways for Health Research Unit in Soweto, South Africa. 19 mothers agreed to participate and were grouped into three focus group discussions (FGDs) by age of the child: 0-6-months, 7-14-months, and 15-24-months. Thereafter, 12 mothers (4 from each FGD) were selected for inclusion in in-depth interviews (IDIs). After coding and theme/sub-theme identification had been completed for all IDIs, a process of cross-cutting theme identification and confirmation across FGDs and IDIs was carried out. Results: The mothers were (mean ± SD) 27 (6) years old. All mothers had attended secondary school, but only nine had matriculated. Only one mother was married (and lived with the child's father), and the majority (n = 15) were unemployed. Most children were male (63%) and were aged 11 (7) months. Four main themes emerged: 1) Physical activity as an indicator for health, 2) Promoting play and development, 3) Gender bias in play, and 4) Screen time. Conclusions: This study showed that developmental attainment was the most important outcome for mothers, and so focussing intervention content on the promotion of child development through movement is advised. Screen time was freely available to children, and we recommend educating mothers on the movement guidelines, with a particular focus on the detrimental effects of screen time in this age group.

473,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.We present a study of the online forum Reddit, specifically a sub-forum for (typically heterosexual) men who identify as involuntary celibates or incels. Incels are an online imagined community/community of practice who wish to, but do not, have sexual relations with women. Owing to this identity, they view themselves as non-normative within broader society and see women and societal standards of masculinity as the cause of their problems. In this paper, we take a small corpus of 67,000 words generated from 50 threads created, and commented on, by incels. We analyse keywords, word frequencies, and concordance lines to explore the representation of gendered social actors. Keyword analysis reveals that references to gendered social actors are particularly salient within this community, leading to an analysis of all such social actors in the corpus. The findings suggest that incels position different groups of men in a hierarchy in which conventionally attractive men occupy the top position. Notably, we find that female social actors are not placed in a similar hierarchy. An additional appraisal analysis of the most frequently occurring male and female social actors shows that men are judged as incapacitated while women are seen as immoral, dishonest and capable of hurting men. Members of the online community also seem preoccupied with physical attractiveness.

474,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: dating violence, or violence in teenage couples, is a socially interesting topic, due to its prevalence and its possible use in predicting violence in adult couples. The perception of violence, or the detection of abusive behaviors by teenagers and young people (which can be considered as equivalent concepts), is essential to prevent violence itself. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to determine which behaviors are identified as abusive by teenagers and young people, and the severity that they attribute to them—meaning how they perceive them. Moreover, we will be able to determine whether there are differences between boys and girls in two countries: Spain and Colombia. Methods: for this study, we used two samples from both countries, with a total of 389 teenagers (50.9% females and 49.1% males) who were, on average, 16.56 years old (SD = 1.94 years). We analyzed the factorial invariance depending on sex and country of the sample and the different profiles of violence perception. Results: we found evidence of the internal validity of the questionnaire for what concerns the perception of inter-partner violence. The results point out that the perception of violence in the relationship is composed of two factors related to each other (Multiple and Emotional Abuse), which are invariant depending of sex and country of origin of the sample. The internal consistency of the test is adequate (>0.90). The analysis of the violence perception profiles indicates that Spanish teenagers have a higher perception of it, and, also, that girls hold a higher perception than boys. Conclusions: the results of this research have shown how dating violence (or violence in teenage couples) is differentially perceived not only between genders, but also across cultural contexts.

Event-related potentials from 40 participants (20 female) was recorded as male and female faces matched or mismatched previous gender-stereotyped statements and were compared with those elicited by faces preceded by gender-unbiased statements. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to account for possible random effects from both participants and the strength of the gender bias. The amplitude of the N170 to faces was larger following stereotyped relative to gender-unbiased statements in both male and female participants, although the effect was larger for males. This result reveals that stereotyping exerts an early effect in face processing and that the impact is higher in men. In later time windows, male faces after female-stereotyped statements elicited large late positivity potential (LPP) responses in both men and women, indicating that the violation of male stereotypes induces a post-perceptual reevaluation of a salient or conflicting event.

Reduced geographical mobility is associated with increased risk of social exclusion and reduced socio-economic and psychological well-being. Facebook audience estimates are timely, openly available and cover most of the countries in the world. Facebook classifies its users based on multiple attributes such as the country of their previous residence, and whether they are frequent travellers. Using these data, we modelled the travelling behaviour of Facebook users grouped by countries of previous and current residence, gender and age. We found strong indications that the frequency of travelling is lower for Facebook users migrating from low-income countries and for women migrating from or living in countries with high gender inequality. Such mobility inequalities impede the smooth integration of migrants from low-income countries to new destinations and their well-being. Moreover, the reduced mobility of women who have lived or currently live in countries with conservative gender norms capture another aspect of the integration which is referring to socio-cultural norms and gender inequality. However, to provide more solid evidence on whether our findings are also valid for the general population, collaboration with Facebook is required to better understand how the data is being produced and pre-processed.",2020-09-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,15,Explaining the travelling behaviour of migrants using facebook audience estimates,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0238947,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,477,PLoS ONE,2020.0,44.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'There are strong indications that the frequency of travelling is lower for Facebook users migrating from low-income countries and for women migrating from or living in countries with high gender inequality.'}",48520894,S.

Using laboratory experiments that model trust-based strategic communication and response, we examined the relationship between gender, gender stereotypes, and gender discriminative lies and challenges. Drawing from a student sample, we presented males and females (N = 80) with incentivized stereotype elicitation tasks that reveal their expectations of lies and challenges from each gender, followed by a series of strategic communication interactions within and between genders. Before interacting, both genders stereotyped females as more trustworthy (expected to send more honest messages) and more trusting (expected to accept and not challenge others’ messages) than males, in accord with cross-cultural gender differences. In best response to these stereotypes, both genders discriminately accepted or challenged messages based on the sender’s gender. However, we find no differences between males’ and females’ overall rates of lies and challenges. After learning the results of their strategic interactions, males and females revised their stereotypes about lies and challenges expected of each gender; these stereotype revisions resulted in greater predictive accuracy and less disparate gender discrimination. This suggests an important facultative feature of human trust-based communication and gender stereotyping: while the delivery and trust of private information is informed by gender stereotypes, these stereotypes are recalibrated with experience.",2020-09-01,Journal,Article,Human Nature,27067,3,31,"Gender, Stereotypes, and Trust in Communication",0,false,10.1007/s12110-020-09376-3,Springer,478,Human Nature,2020.0,82.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'While the delivery and trust of private information is informed by gender stereotypes, these stereotypes are recalibrated with experience, suggesting an important facultative feature of human trust-based communication and gender stereotyping.'}",4040150,Eric Schniter,114638539,Timothy W.

480,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLCSelf-objectification is a pervasive phenomenon, related to specific socio-cultural context, that can lead to many psychological and interpersonal consequences. With the present study, we investigated the correlates of self-objectification in young Italian women analyzing both its traditional antecedents and its consequences for self-presentation on social network sites (SNS). A total of 676 Italian university female students completed a self-reported questionnaire on self-objectification, internalization of a thin-ideal and related influences, internalized sexism, self-esteem, SNS use, selfie-posting on SNS and selfies’ manipulation. Results indicated that media and peers, but not family pressures, were positively associated with thin-ideal internalization, which, in turn, was positively associated with self-objectification. Moreover, both sexism and self-esteem were significantly associated with self-objectification. Regarding self-objectification consequences for SNS usage, results revealed that self-objectification was positively associated with time spent on SNS, frequency of selfie-posting and selfie-editing. It was concluded that objectification theory can be extended into the context of image-related behaviors on SNS. Results suggest that young women with low self-esteem, traditional attitudes toward gender roles and high levels of internalization of thin-ideal may report high levels of self-objectification which, in turn, may be related to specific self-promotion behaviors on social media.

They serve as stable superimposition landmarks to assess tooth movement in orthodontics and as identification aids in forensic odontology. However, the stability of palatal rugae remains controversial. This review aimed to describe the genetic, growth, and environmental factors that may influence the palatal rugae patterns. A broad search of PubMed and ScienceDirect databases was conducted. A total of 193 articles were identified, of which 73 met the selection criteria. Data were extracted into a table that presented the details of the study, sample description, and changes in the palatal rugae patterns. Highlight: There were conflicting results regarding sexual dimorphism and population characterization of the palatal rugae patterns. All rugae showed positional changes, increased lengths, and lower numbers, but no significant shape changes with growth. The lengths, numbers, and positions of the rugae were affected by orthodontic treatment, especially their lateral points, but their individual characteristics did not change. Conclusion: The diversity in rugae patterns and their potential for sex discrimination among different populations showed differing results due to individual variations and the complex influence of genetic, growth, and environmental factors on their morphology.",2020-09-01,Journal,Review,Journal of Oral Biosciences,11200153561,6,62,Morphological patterns of the palatal rugae: A review,0,false,10.1016/j.job.2020.06.003,Japanese Association for Oral Biologyinoue@dent.niigata-u.ac.jp,481,Journal of Oral Biosciences,2020.0,86.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The diversity in rugae patterns and their potential for sex discrimination among different populations showed differing results due to individual variations and the complex influence of genetic, growth, and environmental factors on their morphology.'}",16211775,J.

482,"© 2020 British Ecological SocietySex-biased dispersal (SBD) often skews the local sex ratio in a population. This can result in a shortage of mates for individuals of the less-dispersive sex. Such mate limitation can lead to Allee effects in populations that are small or undergoing range expansion, consequently affecting their survival, growth, stability and invasion speed. Theory predicts that mate shortage can lead to either an increase or a decrease in the dispersal of the less-dispersive sex. However, neither of these predictions have been empirically validated. To investigate how SBD-induced mate limitation affects dispersal of the less-dispersive sex, we used Drosophila melanogaster populations with varying dispersal propensities. To rule out any mate-independent density effects, we examined the behavioural plasticity of dispersal in the presence of mates as well as same-sex individuals with differential dispersal capabilities. In the presence of high-dispersive mates, the dispersal of both male and female individuals was significantly increased. However, the magnitude of this increase was much larger in males than in females, indicating that the former shows greater mate-finding dispersal. Moreover, the dispersal of either sex did not change when dispersing alongside high- or low-dispersive individuals of the same sex. This suggested that the observed plasticity in dispersal was indeed due to mate-finding dispersal, and not mate-independent density effects. Strong mate-finding dispersal can diminish the magnitude of sex bias in dispersal. This can modulate the evolutionary processes that shape range expansions and invasions, depending on the population size. In small populations, mate-finding dispersal can ameliorate Allee effects. However, in large populations, it can dilute the effects of spatial sorting.",2020-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Animal Ecology,29544,5,89,Mate-finding dispersal reduces local mate limitation and sex bias in dispersal,2,,10.1111/1365-2656.13278,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,482,Journal of Animal Ecology,2020.0,64.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'To investigate how SBD-induced mate limitation affects dispersal of the less-dispersive sex, Drosophila melanogaster populations with varying dispersal propensities were used and observed plasticity in dispersal was indeed due to mate-finding dispersal, and not mate-independent density effects.'}",152365354,Abhishek Mishra,37640221,S.

484,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Objectives: Described as an indiscriminate killer by many chroniclers, the Black Death descended on London during the 14th century. To best understand the pattern of transmission among demographic groups, models should include multiple demographic and health covariates concurrently, something rarely done when examining Black Death, but implemented in this study to identify which demographic groups had a higher susceptibility. Female predisposition to the Black Death was also explored, focusing on whether social inequality added to vulnerability. Materials and methods: Three attritional cemeteries from the Wellcome Osteological Research Database were compared with the Black Death cemetery, East Smithfield. A Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazards ratios of dying of the Black Death, using transition analysis ages-at-death as the time variable, and sex and frailty as covariates. Additionally, a binomial logistic regression generated odds ratios for age-at-death, sex, and frailty. Results: The Cox model produced a significant hazards ratio for individuals deemed frail. Similarly, the logit model calculated significantly increased odds ratios for frail individuals, and decreased odds for individuals aged 65+. Discussion: The older individuals were not undergoing growth during times of great stress in London pre-dating the Black Death epidemic, which may explain the decreased odds of contracting the Black Death. Further, although women dealt with social inequality, which partially led to the demographic puzzle of the Medieval “missing” women, women's susceptibility to infection by the Black Death was not increased. The phenomenon of the missing women may be due to a combination of factors, including infant and child mortality and preservation.",2020-09-01,Journal,Article,American Journal of Physical Anthropology,33784,13,173,Survival analysis of the Black Death: Social inequality of women and the perils of life and death in Medieval London,0,false,10.1002/ajpa.24081,Wiley-Liss Inc.info@wiley.com,484,American Journal of Physical Anthropology,2020.0,66.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Although women dealt with social inequality, which partially led to the demographic puzzle of the Medieval ""missing"" women, women\'s susceptibility to infection by the Black Death was not increased and thus the phenomenon of the missing women may be due to a combination of factors.'}",6876025,K.

Although the problem of biased datasets on abusive language detection has been addressed more frequently, biases arising from trained classifiers have not yet been a matter of concern. In this paper, we first introduce a transfer learning approach for hate speech detection based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and evaluate the proposed model on two publicly available datasets that have been annotated for racism, sexism, hate or offensive content on Twitter. Next, we introduce a bias alleviation mechanism to mitigate the effect of bias in training set during the fine-tuning of our pre-trained BERT-based model for hate speech detection. Toward that end, we use an existing regularization method to reweight input samples, thereby decreasing the effects of high correlated training set’ s n-grams with class labels, and then fine-tune our pre-trained BERT-based model with the new re-weighted samples. To evaluate our bias alleviation mechanism, we employed a cross-domain approach in which we use the trained classifiers on the aforementioned datasets to predict the labels of two new datasets from Twitter, AAE-aligned and White-aligned groups, which indicate tweets written in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE), respectively. The results show the existence of systematic racial bias in trained classifiers, as they tend to assign tweets written in AAE from AAE-aligned group to negative classes such as racism, sexism, hate, and offensive more often than tweets written in SAE from White-aligned group. However, the racial bias in our classifiers reduces significantly after our bias alleviation mechanism is incorporated. This work could institute the first step towards debiasing hate speech and abusive language detection systems.",2020-08-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,45,15,Hate speech detection and racial bias mitigation in social media based on BERT model,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0237861,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,486,PLoS ONE,2020.0,50.0,8.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A transfer learning approach for hate speech detection based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and a bias alleviation mechanism to mitigate the effect of bias in training set during the fine-tuning of the proposed model.'}",2639305,Marzieh Mozafari,2633697,R.

This is especially important in animals with relatively stable social groups. The amphisbaenian Trogonophis wiegmanni is a semi blind fossorial reptile that spends its entire life underground where it interacts with mates and social partners. In this environment, visual cues are limited. Chemosensory cues may rather allow conspecific social and partner recognition. We recorded the number of tongue-flick (TF) rates of T. wiegmanni amphisbaenians to scents of both sexes with different pairing social bonds (familiar vs. unfamiliar) presented on cotton swabs to test discrimination of social groups. As seen from a rise in the number of TFs, males discriminated unfamiliar females from unfamiliar males. This suggests that chemical cues may be used by males to locate new mates. In contrast, females detected scent of unfamiliar conspecifics, but did not show sex discrimination. Both males and females discriminated the scent of an individual with which they had formed a pair bond from an unfamiliar individual of the same sex as the partner. Also, males, but not females, were capable of self-recognition, suggesting that scent marks of males in home ranges may provide individual information in intrasexual relationships. We conclude that conspecific discrimination based on chemical cues may allow the maintenance of social relationships and relatively stable pairs in fossorial reptiles inhabiting visually restricted environments.",2020-08-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,9,15,"How to maintain underground social relationships?

Using data from five top neuroscience journals, we find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender were unrelated to referencing.

Methods: Discrimination in eight possible settings was assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination scale at year 7; CVH two decades later was examined using a modified Life’s Simple 7 score, with higher scores indicating better health. Separate multivariable linear regressions evaluated the associations between reports of racial and gender discrimination and CVH score in each possible setting stratified by gendered race. Results: Mean (SD) CVH scores at year 30 were 7.8(1.9), 8.1(1.8), 8.9(2. 0), and 8.8(1.8) among black women, black men, white women, and white men, respectively. For black women, reporting both racial and gender discrimination while receiving medical care was associated with lower CVH score. Among black men, reporting both forms of discrimination while getting a job, at work, at school, and receiving medical care was associated with lower CVH score. Among whites, reported discrimination while obtaining housing and by the police or courts (women), and in public and at work (men), was associated with a lower CVH score.

491,"© 2019 American Psychological Association.We proposed that the Prescriptive Beauty Norm (PBN), the injunctive demand for women to intensively pursue beauty, reflects motives to maintain gender hierarchy and translates into employment discrimination. In Studies 1a and 1b, the PBN (distinct from other ""beauty myth"" [Wolf, 1990] components; namely, bodily and grooming standards, and attainability beliefs) uniquely correlated with hierarchysupporting values and ideologies. In Study 2, experimentally threatening (vs. affirming) gender hierarchy increased PBN endorsement among sexist (but not nonsexist) participants, an effect mediated by power values. In Studies 3 and 4, participants who scored high (vs. low) in sexism (Study 3) and social dominance orientation (Study 4) enforced higher appearance requirements for women in powerful (vs. entry-level), masculine professions. This ""beauty tax"" targeted women more than men (Study 3) and was mediated by PBN endorsement (Study 4). Illustrating real-life implications, in an organizational setting (Study 5), sexism predicted penalizing ""insufficiently groomed"" female candidates more for high-power (vs. low-power) jobs.

Data were collected from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, and analyzed from June 7 to November 6, 2019. Exposures: Faculty assessments of resident performance during general medicine inpatient rotations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Standardized scores were calculated based on rating distributions for the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's core competencies and internal medicine Milestones at each site. Standardized scores are expressed as SDs from the mean. The interaction of gender and postgraduate year (PGY) with standardized scores was assessed, adjusting for site, time of year, resident In-Training Examination percentile rank, and faculty rank and specialty. Results: Data included 3600 evaluations for 703 residents (387 male [55.0%]) by 605 faculty (318 male [52.6%]). Interaction between resident gender and PGY was significant in 6 core competencies. In PGY2, female residents scored significantly higher than male residents in 4 of 6 competencies, including patient care (mean standardized score [SE], 0.10 [0.04] vs 0.22 [0.05]; P =.04), systems-based practice (mean standardized score [SE], -0.06 [0.05] vs 0.13 [0.05]; P =.003), professionalism (mean standardized score [SE], -0.04 [0.06] vs 0.21 [0.06]; P =.001), and interpersonal and communication skills (mean standardized score [SE], 0.06 [0.05] vs 0.32 [0.06]; P <.001). In PGY3, male residents scored significantly higher than female patients in 5 of 6 competencies, including patient care (mean standardized score [SE], 0.47 [0.05] vs 0.32 [0.05]; P =.03), medical knowledge (mean standardized score [SE], 0.47 [0.05] vs 0.24 [0.06]; P =.003), systems-based practice (mean standardized score [SE], 0.30 [0.05] vs 0.12 [0.06]; P =.02), practice-based learning (mean standardized score [SE], 0.39 [0.05] vs 0.16 [0.06]; P =.004), and professionalism (mean standardized score [SE], 0.35 [0.05] vs 0.18 [0.06]; P =.03). There was a significant increase in male residents' competency scores between PGY2 and PGY3 (range of difference in mean adjusted standardized scores between PGY2 and PGY3, 0.208-0.391; P ≤.002) that was not seen in female residents' scores (range of difference in mean adjusted standardized scores between PGY2 and PGY3, -0.117 to 0.101; P ≥.14). There was a significant increase in male residents' scores between PGY2 and PGY3 cohorts in 6 competencies with female faculty and in 4 competencies with male faculty. There was no significant change in female residents' competency scores between PGY2 to PGY3 cohorts with male or female faculty. Interaction between faculty-resident gender dyad and PGY was significant in the patient care competency (β estimate [SE] for female vs male dyad in PGY1 vs PGY3, 0.184 [0.158]; β estimate [SE] for female vs male dyad in PGY2 vs PGY3, 0.457 [0.181]; P =.04). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, resident gender was associated with differences in faculty assessments of resident performance, and differences were linked to PGY. In contrast to male residents' scores, female residents' scores displayed a peak-and-plateau pattern whereby assessment scores peaked in PGY2. Notably, the peak-and-plateau pattern was seen in assessments by male and female faculty. Further study of factors that influence gender-based differences in assessment is needed..",2020-07-16,Journal,Article,JAMA Network Open,21100900345,13,3,Association of Gender with Learner Assessment in Graduate Medical Education,1,true,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.10888,American Medical Association,492,JAMA Network Open,2020.0,34.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This cross-sectional study evaluates the association of gender with assessment of internal medicine residents and finds that gender does not appear to have an effect on the quality of the assessment of residents.'}",2071122799,Robin Klein,48100899,N.

Second, I argue that the relationality of online speech implies that any message is embedded in idiosyncratic socio-cultural norms, and that therefore a 'one size fits all' definition of hate speech is elusive.

Women in two independent samples (Ns = 540 and 345) reported how frequently they experienced various hostile and benevolent forms of gender-based treatment derived from ambivalent sexism theory. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, along with item response theory, resulted in a 28-item scale (the Experiences with Ambivalent Sexism Inventory [EASI]) with five subscales assessing hostile sexism, heterosexual hostility, protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy. The EASI demonstrates good internal consistency reliability, convergent and divergent validity, concurrent validity, and incremental validity when compared with a self-report measure of benevolent sexism. Moreover, it can be used flexibly to measure sexism experiences within specific contexts.

The present study aimed to address methodological differences across previous studies and investigate the conditions under which interference from emotional stimuli can either be elicited or eliminated under high cognitive conflict. Four behavioural experiments were conducted with a university sample using a gender-discrimination stimulus-response compatibility task. In line with our previous findings, Experiment 1 found that when emotion and cognitive conflict conditions were blocked, emotional faces increased reaction time interference during response compatible trials (low conflict) but not response incompatible trials (high conflict). However, when conflict and emotion conditions were randomised in different configurations across Experiments 2 (all trials randomised), 3 (emotion blocked, compatibility randomised) and 4 (compatibility blocked, emotion randomised), emotion interfered with task performance across both high and low conflict trials. These results suggest that predictability of both compatibility and emotion is required in order to obtain reduced emotional interference under high cognitive conflict.

Sports are a global phenomenon and are enjoyed by many in almost every corner of the world. Regrettably, there are marginalised women and girls who lack opportunities to participate. Anaza & McDowell (2017) found that sports are perceived as a male preserve in Nigeria.

The consequences are creating a serious public health problem and have hence aroused the interest of many researchers as to its causes. Most have centered on the role of the aggressor. However, the processes of aggression and victimization are inseparable, and relegating the victims to the background only contributes to increasing the prevalence, severity, and perdurability of the problem. The objectives of this study were to: (i) identify the types and frequency of abuse that adolescents suffer in their relationships; (ii) analyze the relationship between sexist attitudes, acceptance of violence, and victimization; and (iii) determine predictors of the violence suffered in adolescent dating relationships. The sample comprised 2577 adolescents (55.2% girls) of 14 to 18 years in age (M = 15.9, SD = 1.2). The instruments used were the dating violence questionnaire (Cuestionario de Violencia de Novios, CUVINO) and the Scale of detection of sexism in adolescents (Escala de Detección de Sexismo en Adolescentes, DSA). The results indicate that victims showed high tolerance towards gender violence. Acceptance was greater the more frequent the abuse or aggressions suffered. Regarding sexist attitudes, only those belonging to the benevolent dimension had predictive value. The results also show that the interaction between acceptance of the abuse suffered and the manifestation of benevolent sexist attitudes predicted victimization involving specific forms of aggression.",2020-07-02,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,25,17,Synergy between acceptance of violence and sexist attitudes as a dating violence risk factor,1,true,10.3390/ijerph17145209,MDPI AGPostfachBaselCH-4005rasetti@mdpi.com,497,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2020.0,63.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results indicate that victims showed high tolerance towards gender violence, and the interaction between acceptance of the abuse suffered and the manifestation of benevolent sexist attitudes predicted victimization involving specific forms of aggression.'}",1422438224,I.

The mean age was 24.62 years (SD = 6.3). Participants answered four instruments in addition to sociodemographic questions: Gendered Racial Microaggression Scale, Goldberg General Health Questionnaire, Group Identification Scale, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.

Self-esteem mediates the relationship between microaggressions and general health. It is a protective factor of mental health. Identity moderates this relationship, so that a high identification as a black woman is related to lower levels of mental health when faced with a high frequency of discriminatory events.

We aimed to investigate the association of workplace gender discrimination and depressive symptoms among employed women in South Korea. Methods The 6th wave (2016) survey datasets of the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women and Family (KLoWF) were analyzed for 2,339 respondents who are identified as wage workers. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the short-form (10-item) Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Association of workplace gender discrimination and depressive symptoms was assessed using multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounding variables including age, income satisfaction, education level, marital status, and currently diagnosed disease. We then measured the age effect using age stratification multivariate logistic regression model. Results Women who experienced gender discrimination at workplace had higher odds of depressive symptoms regardless of the type of the discrimination including hiring, promotion, work assignments, paid wages, and firing. These associations were consistent in younger women below 40 years of age in regard to hiring, promotion, paid wages and firing, whereas inconsistent among older women above 40 years of age.

The evaluation of gender bias in training is warranted with increasing numbers of female trainees in colon and rectal surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate gender bias in colon and rectal surgery training program operative experience. DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The Association of Program Directors for Colon and Rectal Surgery robotic case log database contains operative details (procedure, attending surgeon, case percentage, and operative segments) completed by trainees as console surgeon for 2 academic years (2016-2017, 2017-2018). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcomes measured are the percentage of trainee console participation and the completion of total mesorectal excision. Resident and attending surgeon gender was recorded retrospectively. The cohort was separated into 4 groups based on resident and attending surgeon gender combination. Case volume, average console participation per case, and completion of total mesorectal excisions were compared for each group by using interaction regression analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two training programs participated, including 120 trainees and 190 attending surgeons. Forty-five (37.5%) trainees and 36 (18.9%) attending surgeons were women. The average number of cases per trainee was 23.27 per year for women and 28.15 per year for men (p = 0.19). Average console participation was 53.5% for women and 61.7% for men (p < 0.001). Male attending surgeons provided female trainees less console participation than male counterparts (52.1% vs 59.7%, p < 0.001). Female attending surgeons provided the same amount of console participation to female and male trainees (63.3% vs 61.8%, p = 0.62). Male trainees performed significantly more complete total mesorectal excision console cases than female trainees (57.16% vs 42.38%, p < 0.0001). LIMITATIONS: The data are subject to self-reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS: There is gender disparity in robotic operative experience in colon and rectal surgery training programs with less opportunity for console participation and less opportunity to complete total mesorectal excisions for female trainees. This trend should be highlighted and further evaluated to resolve this disparity.

The authors conclude with current gaps in research. Recent Findings: Although there are a lack of investigations analyzing and reporting physician burnout data by gender, there is evidence to suggest that women physicians experience stress and burnout differently than their men counterparts. Women physicians are more likely to face gender discrimination, gender biases, deferred personal life decisions, and barriers to professional advancement, all of which may contribute to burnout. Summary: Interventions specific to preventing physician burnout in women should include (1) addressing barriers to career satisfaction, work life integration, and mental health; (2) identification and reduction of gender and maternal bias; (3) mentorship and sponsorship opportunities; (4) family leave, lactation, and child care policies and support.

Pro-male bias and stereotype threat appear to contribute to gender imbalance in surgery. Objectives: To evaluate the association between pro-male gender bias and career engagement and the effect of stereotype threat on skill performance among trainees in academic surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 2-phase study with a double-blind, randomized clinical trial component was conducted in 3 academic general surgery training programs. Residents were recruited between August 1 and August 15, 2018, and the study was completed at the end of that academic year. In phase 1, surveys administered 5 to 6 months apart investigated the association of gender bias with career engagement. In phase 2, residents were randomized 1:1 using permuted-block design stratified by site, training level, and gender to receive either a trigger of or protection against stereotype threat. Immediately after the interventions, residents completed the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) assessment followed by a final survey. A total of 131 general surgery residents were recruited; of these 96 individuals with academic career interests met eligibility criteria; 86 residents completed phase 1. Eighty-five residents were randomized in phase 2, and 4 residents in each arm were lost to follow-up. Intervention: Residents read abstracts that either reported that women had worse laparoscopic skill performance than men (trigger of stereotype threat [A]) or had no difference in performance (protection against stereotype threat [B]). Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between perception of pro-male gender bias and career engagement survey scores (phase 1) and stereotype threat intervention and FLS scores (phase 2) were the outcomes. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Results: Seventy-seven residents (38 women [49.4%]) completed both phases of the study. The association between pro-male gender bias and career engagement differed by gender (interaction coefficient, -1.19; 95% CI, -1.90 to -0.49; P =.02); higher perception of bias was associated with higher engagement among men (coefficient, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.19-2.24; P =.04), but no significant association was observed among women (coefficient, -0.25; 95% CI, -1.59 to 1.08; P =.50). There was no evidence of a difference in FLS score between interventions (mean [SD], A: 395 [150] vs B: 367 [157]; P =.51). The response to stereotype threat activation was similar in men and women (interaction coefficient, 15.1; 95% CI, -124.5 to 154.7; P =.39). The association between stereotype threat activation and FLS score differed by gender across levels of susceptibility to stereotype threat (interaction coefficient, -35.3; 95% CI, -47.0 to -23.6; P =.006). Higher susceptibility to stereotype threat was associated with lower FLS scores among women who received a stereotype threat trigger (coefficient, -43.4; 95% CI, -48.0 to -38.9; P =.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Perception of pro-male bias and gender stereotypes may influence career engagement and skill performance, respectively, among surgical trainees.

507,"© 2020Low grade, chronic inflammation is a critical risk factor for immunologic dysfunction including autoimmune diseases. However, the multiplicity of complex mechanisms and lack of relevant murine models limit our understanding of the precise role of chronic inflammation. To address these hurdles, we took advantage of multi-omics data and a unique murine model with a low but chronic expression of IFN-γ, generated by replacement of the AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3’ UTR region of IFN-γ mRNA with random nucleotides. Herein, we demonstrate that low but differential expression of IFN-γ in mice by homozygous or heterozygous ARE replacement triggers distinctive gut microbial alterations, of which alteration is female-biased with autoimmune-associated microbiota. Metabolomics data indicates that gut microbiota-dependent metabolites have more robust sex-differences than microbiome profiling, particularly those involved in fatty acid oxidation and nuclear receptor signaling. More importantly, homozygous ARE-Del mice have dramatic changes in tryptophan metabolism, bile acid and long-chain lipid metabolism, which interact with gut microbiota and nuclear receptor signaling similarly with sex-dependent metabolites. Consistent with these findings, nuclear receptor signaling, encompassing molecules such as PPARs, FXR, and LXRs, was detectable as a top canonical pathway in comparison of blood and tissue-specific gene expression between female homozygous vs heterozygous ARE-Del mice. Further analysis implies that dysregulated autophagy in macrophages is critical for breaking self-tolerance and gut homeostasis, while pathways interact with nuclear receptor signaling to regulate inflammatory responses. Overall, pathway-based integration of multi-omics data provides systemic and cellular insights about how chronic inflammation driven by IFN-γ results in the development of autoimmune diseases with specific etiopathological features.",2020-07-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Autoimmunity,21268,14,111,"Multi-omics: Differential expression of IFN-γ results in distinctive mechanistic features linking chronic inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and autoimmune diseases",2,,10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102436,Academic Press,507,Journal of Autoimmunity,2020.0,78.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is demonstrated that low but differential expression of IFN-γ in mice by homozygous or heterozygous ARE replacement triggers distinctive gut microbial alterations, of which alteration is female-biased with autoimmune-associated microbiota.'}",10200486,Heekyong R.

The purpose of this study is to identify health system, provider, and user-related factors that may hinder detection and treatment of hypertension and diabetes using a traditional and behavioral economics approach. We did qualitative research using in-depth semistructured interviews and focus groups with healthcare providers and adult users of Public Primary Care Clinics. Health system barriers included inadequate care accessibility; poor integration between primary care clinics and local hospitals; lack of resources; and gender bias and neglect of adult chronic disease. Healthcare provider-related barriers were inadequate training; lack of availability or reluctance to adopt Clinical Practice Guidelines; and lack of counseling prioritization. From a behavioral economics perspective, bottlenecks were related to inertia and a status quo, overconfidence, and optimism biases. User-related barriers for treatment adherence included lack of accurate information; resistance to adopt lifelong treatment; affordability; and medical advice mistrust. From a behavioral economics perspective, the most significant bottlenecks were overconfidence and optimism, limited attention, and present biases. Based on these findings, new interventions that aim to improve prevention and control of chronic conditions can be proposed.

Compositional change with respect to education is the main driver for growing inequality. Other factors are less influential but still relevant: marginal returns for several wage-related personal characteristics have grown faster in male-typed occupations. Net of individual-level heterogeneity, traditionally male occupations have also become more attractive because of rising returns to task-specific skills. Discrimination of women in typically male lines of work seems to have declined, too, which erased part of the wage penalty these women had previously experienced.

To illustrate and discuss possible gender bias related to medicines, through the consumption analysis in women, the prescription of biological drugs according to sex, the potential gender inequality in adverse drug reactions, and research with clinical trials, as well as the decisions of international institutions in the marketing of medicinal products. There is greater tendency to prescribe pain relievers, regardless of pain, and drugs for low intensity depressive symptoms in women than in men. The opposite occurs in the prescription of statins and adequate doses, and with the greater probability of prescribing anti-tumor necrosis factor in men than in women with ankylosing spondylitis, despite a similar disease burden. Adverse drug reactions are observed more frequently in women than in men, where determinants such as body weight are having little influence on the dosage. It is currently scarcely considered in the prescription that women have differences in the activity of cytochrome CYPP450 enzymes, which can affect the liver's metabolism rate. There are even immunological, genetic and epigenetic effects (due to heredity and uneven gene dosing located in the X and Y chromosomes) that can influence these differences by sex. Finally, through cases of hormonal therapy clinical trials, a drug for women's inhibited sexual desire and a contraceptive for men, gender bias and stereotypes are shown to influence a potential generation of inequalities, especially in adverse drug reactions to the detriment of women. In conclusion, health professionals frequently attribute physical symptoms to women's emotionality, influencing their greater prescription of symptomatic drugs. Whether the same reason influences the lower prescription of therapeutic drugs in women than in men should be analyzed.

Simultaneously, at least during the last 40 years, women have become an increasingly vibrant force within the ABS, including playing significant roles within the leadership of the society.

The present study applied the precarious manhood paradigm to a hypermasculine advertisement. A sample of 208 men was collected online.

One commercial was a neutral, control advertisement, and one was a hypermasculine advertisement. We also measured participants’ endorsement of masculine norms.

Between May 2018 and April 2019, we developed a questionnaire with 328 items across 10 domains including gender identity; language used for sexual and reproductive anatomy and events; gender affirmation process history; sexual orientation and sexual activity; contraceptive use and preferences; pregnancy history and desires; abortion history and preferences; priorities for sexual and reproductive health care; family building experiences; and sociodemographic characteristics. Recognizing that the words people use for their sexual and reproductive anatomy can vary, we programmed the survey to allow participants to input the words they use to describe their bodies, and then used those customized words to replace traditional medical terms throughout the survey. This process-oriented paper aims to describe the rationale for and collaborative development of an affirming, customizable survey of the SRH needs and experiences of sexual and gender minorities, and to present summary demographic characteristics of 3,110 people who completed the survey.

Specifically, the study sought to identify and explore the determinants of active and healthy ageing using a mixed-methods approach involving qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Focus group discussions were conducted complemented by a survey (random and snowball sampling) using a structured questionnaire. Narratives and thematic analysis were used to analyze the data generated from the focus group discussion and Tobit regression was employed to analyze the multiple determinants of active ageing by dimensions and on a global scale in Cameroon. Results identified three key dimensions of active and healthy ageing: employment/livelihood options (EL), community support and health (CH) and housing and living in Bamenda (HL). The regression results reveal gender bias in active ageing, a non-effect of education and health on active ageing, and a positive effect of income on active and healthy ageing.

525,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Why do some women enjoy and internalize sexist jokes, whereas others express sharp disapproval? To answer this question, we explored the role of cavalier humor beliefs (jokes are fun and harmless, or “just jokes”), in addition to known predictors such as social dominance orientation and hostile sexism. In Experiment 1, women (N = 225) reported their amusement and offensiveness in response to three types of jokes: aggressive sexist jokes, belittling sexist jokes, and neutral jokes. Cavalier humor beliefs predicted higher amusement and lower offensiveness ratings for all jokes (including neutral), but more strongly predicted lower offensiveness ratings for the aggressive and belittling sexist jokes, suggesting that these beliefs might be highjacked by those who mask prejudiced intentions. In contrast, social dominance orientation and hostile sexism were each associated with favorable reactions to sexist but not neutral jokes. In Experiment 2, we explored the role of cavalier humor beliefs (and hostile sexism) in women's (N = 226) acceptance of sexist jokes, and subsequent release of bias against women following sexist joke exposure. Overall, exposure to aggressive (vs. neutral) jokes led women to rate the jokes as unfunny and offensive, but these objections were dampened among women higher in cavalier humor beliefs, even after controlling for hostile sexism. Critically, among women higher in cavalier humor beliefs, aggressive joke exposure facilitated acceptance of discrimination against women, even when accounting for hostile sexism. Thus, cavalier humor beliefs perpetuate sexism among women, whose ingroup is targeted by sexist humor. Implications for Prejudiced Norm Theory are discussed.",2020-05-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,15499,7,88,"“To the moon, Alice”: Cavalier humor beliefs and women's reactions to aggressive and belittling sexist jokes",0,false,10.1016/j.jesp.2020.103973,Academic Press Inc.apjcs@harcourt.com,525,,2020.0,34.0,0.0,,81655669,E.

Data were collected via an anonymous online questionnaire administered to 338 active duty male soldiers between the ages of 18 and 24 at an Army post in the mid-South region of the United States. Analyses examined the extent soldiers accurately perceived the collective norms of their peers. Men were inaccurate in their estimation of the extent to which other male soldiers followed principles of consent in their sexual behaviors, such as stopping the first time a woman says “no” to sexual activity, stopping sexual activity even if aroused, and garnering a verbal affirmation for sex. Soldiers were inaccurate in their perception of peer norms regarding indicators of sexual interest and consent, including the belief that when a woman lets a man kiss her she wants to have sex, and if a woman wears a sexy dress she’s asking for sex. Soldiers were also inaccurate in their estimations of other male soldier’s comfort with sexism including feeling uncomfortable with sexist comments or sexual jokes that put down women. In addition, soldiers underestimated men’s preference for a good relationship with one woman rather than many sexual partners and overestimated their peers’ use of dating sites to locate sexual partners.

Research suggests sexism toward women (versus men) is particularly threatening due to inequalities in social power. In Study 1, we examined whether men and women differ in how amused and offended they were by sexist humor. We predicted men would perceive sexist humor as more funny and less offensive than women would. In Study 2, we examined whether perceptions of threat were related to perceptions of sexist jokes. We predicted women would perceive more threat than men from sexist humor, which would lead to lower amusement and greater perceived offensiveness. Across both studies, jokes targeting women were perceived to be less funny, more offensive, and more sexist than jokes targeting men. Additionally, greater perceptions of threat were related to greater perceptions of jokes as offensive and sexist. However, women were not more threatened than men by sexist jokes.

530,"© 2019, Springer Nature B.V.Medicine is a gendered discipline, in which women, both as patients and practitioners, have often held subordinate positions. The reproduction of dominant gender biases in the medical setting can negatively impact the professional development of medical students and the wellbeing of patients. In this analysis of medical students’ narratives of professionalism dilemmas, we explore students’ experiences of gender bias in hospital settings. Seventy-one students participated in 12 group interviews, where they discussed witnessing or participating in various activities that they thought were professionalism lapses. Within the dataset, 21 narratives had a distinctly gendered component broadly pertaining to patient dignity and safety dilemmas, informed consent issues, and female student abuse. Interestingly, perpetrators of such acts were commonly female healthcare professionals and educators. Although students recognized such acts as professionalism lapses and often expressed concern for patient wellbeing, students did not intervene or report such acts due to hierarchical cultural contexts, and at times even reproduced the discriminatory behavior they were criticizing. This raises concerns about medical students’ professionalism development and the extent to which gender bias is ingrained within particular medical systems. The normalization of disrespectful and abusive treatment of female patients poses immediate and future consequences to the wellbeing and safety of women. Furthermore, the same socio-cultural values that sustain these acts may account for perpetrators often being women themselves as they strive to overcome their subordinate position within medicine.",2020-05-01,Journal,Article,Advances in Health Sciences Education,26913,5,25,Female victims and female perpetrators: medical students’ narratives of gender dynamics and professionalism dilemmas,0,false,10.1007/s10459-019-09919-z,Springereditorial@springerplus.com,530,Advances in Health Sciences Education,2019.0,76.0,0.0,,23488093,M.

An evaluation of violent intimate partner relationships was undertaken using a tool known as the ""Traffic Light of Gender Violence"". Results: Significant association was found between countries and the items related to the control of dress and outings, punishment by indifference, jealousy, overprotection and control by means of the mobile phone. On the other hand, formal education generates a decrease in gender violence suffered in women. With regard to age, males between 25 and 30 years of age show a significant increase in verbal violence and sexual coercion. Conclusion: Cultural and traditional rules can affect intimate partner violence.

EVIDENCEACQUISITION: We searched the following electronic databases from January 2001 to December 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAIL, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials), DARE(Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and ACP Journal Club database. EVIDENCESYNTHESIS: Several studies have reported higher male susceptibility to pulmonary infections and higher risk of death due to sepsis. Biological differences (e.g. hormonal cycles and cellular immune-mediated responses) together with cultural, behavioral and socio-economic differences are important determinants of the course and outcome of CAP. However, gender-related bias in the provision of care and use of hospital resources has been reported among women, resulting in delayed hospital admission and consequently necessary care. CONCLUSIONS: CAP is more severe in males than in females, leading to higher mortality in males, especially in older age. To identify gender differences in CAP can guide patient's prognostication and management.",2020-04-01,Journal,Review,Minerva Medica,26687,22,111,Gender differences in community-acquired pneumonia,0,false,10.23736/S0026-4806.20.06448-4,Edizioni Minerva Medicasubscriptions.dept@minervamedica.it,536,Minerva Medica,2020.0,126.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""The available literature evidences about gender's influence on the clinical course of CAP are provided in order to optimize the assessment, monitoring and treatment of this disease and to reduce its negative outcomes.""}",46176357,Elena Barbagelata,3871493,C.

Other bias types however have received lesser amounts of scrutiny. This work describes a large-scale analysis of sentiment associations in popular word embedding models along the lines of gender and ethnicity but also along the less frequently studied dimensions of socioeconomic status, age, physical appearance, sexual orientation, religious sentiment and political leanings. Consistent with previous scholarly literature, this work has found systemic bias against given names popular among African-Americans in most embedding models examined. Gender bias in embedding models however appears to be multifaceted and often reversed in polarity to what has been regularly reported. Interestingly, using the common operationalization of the term bias in the fairness literature, novel types of so far unreported bias types in word embedding models have also been identified. Specifically, the popular embedding models analyzed here display negative biases against middle and working-class socioeconomic status, male children, senior citizens, plain physical appearance and intellectual phenomena such as Islamic religious faith, non-religiosity and conservative political orientation. Reasons for the paradoxical underreporting of these bias types in the relevant literature are probably manifold but widely held blind spots when searching for algorithmic bias and a lack of widespread technical jargon to unambiguously describe a variety of algorithmic associations could conceivably be playing a role. The causal origins for the multiplicity of loaded associations attached to distinct demographic groups within embedding models are often unclear but the heterogeneity of said associations and their potential multifactorial roots raises doubts about the validity of grouping them all under the umbrella term bias. Richer and more fine-grained terminology as well as a more comprehensive exploration of the bias landscape could help the fairness epistemic community to characterize and neutralize algorithmic discrimination more efficiently.",2020-04-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,13,15,Wide range screening of algorithmic bias in word embedding models using large sentiment lexicons reveals underreported bias types,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0231189,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,537,PLoS ONE,2020.0,34.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This work describes a large-scale analysis of sentiment associations in popular word embedding models along the lines of gender and ethnicity but also along the less frequently studied dimensions of socioeconomic status, age, physical appearance, sexual orientation, religious sentiment and political leanings.'}",46787843,David Rozado,,,,,,,,,,,24.0,158.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Medicine, Psychology"

All rights reserved.Importance: Biological sex and sociocultural gender represent major sources of diversity among patients, and recent research has shown the association of sex and gender with health. A growing body of literature describes widespread associations of sex and gender with cells, organs, and the manner in which individual patients interact with health care systems. Sex- and gender-informed medicine is a young paradigm of clinical practice and medical research founded on this literature that considers the association of sex and gender with each element of the disease process from risk, to presentation, to response to therapy. Observations: Characteristics that underlie sex and gender involve both endogenous and exogenous factors that change throughout the life course. This review details clinical examples with broad applicability that highlight sex and gender differences in the key domains of genetics, epigenomic modifiers, hormonal milieu, immune function, neurocognitive aging process, vascular health, response to therapeutics, and interaction with health care systems. These domains interact with one another in multidimensional associations, contributing to the diversity of the sex and gender spectra. Novel research has identified differences of clinical relevance with the potential to improve care for all patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Clinicians should consider incorporating sex and gender in their decision-making to practice precision medicine that integrates fundamental components of patient individuality. Recognizing the biological and environmental factors that affect the disease course is imperative to optimizing care for each patient. Research highlights the myriad ways sex and gender play a role in health and disease. However, these clinically relevant insights have yet to be systematically incorporated into care. The framework described in this review serves as a guide to help clinicians consider sex and gender as they practice precision medicine.",2020-04-01,Journal,Review,JAMA Internal Medicine,21100228546,82,180,Clinical Advances in Sex- and Gender-Informed Medicine to Improve the Health of All: A Review,0,false,10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.7194,American Medical Associationsmcleod@itsa.ucsf.edu,538,JAMA Internal Medicine,2020.0,113.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Clinical examples with broad applicability that highlight sex and gender differences in the key domains of genetics, epigenomic modifiers, hormonal milieu, immune function, neurocognitive aging process, vascular health, response to therapeutics, and interaction with health care systems are detailed.'}",9913840,D.

540,"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons LtdAims: Sexual harassment towards nurses is a major concern universally, but no meta-analysis on the worldwide prevalence of sexual harassment towards nurses has yet been published. This study examined the worldwide prevalence of sexual harassment against nurses and explored its moderating factors. Design: Meta-analysis of observational studies. Data sources: The PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases from their commencement date to February 2018 were systematically and independently searched by two investigators. Review methods: Data on the prevalence of sexual harassment experienced by nurses were extracted and pooled using the random-effects model. Results: A total of 43 studies covering 52,345 nurses were included in the analyses. Female nurses accounted for 83.87% of the 32,970 subjects in 25 studies with available data on gender ratio. The prevalence of sexual harassment towards nurses in the past 12 months and during nursing career were 12.6% (95% CI: 10.9–14.4%) and 53.4% (95% CI: 23.1–83.7%), respectively. Gender, use of the WHO questionnaires, lower middle-income and high-income countries, sample size, survey year, and mean age of subjects were significantly associated with the prevalence of sexual harassment. Conclusion: The high prevalence of sexual harassment against nurses found in this meta-analysis represents the ongoing sexism and deleterious effects (e.g., poor work quality and efficiency, increased stress and job dissatisfaction) in the profession. Appropriate preventive measures, training, and empowerment of nurses are needed to ensure workplace safety and equality in this profession. Impact: The study addressed the worldwide prevalence of sexual harassment against nurses and its moderating factors.

541,"© 2019 American Association for AnatomyCrested vertebrates are known from a wide variety of modern and fossil taxa, however, the actual formation and function of the crest is still debatable. Among modern birds, the globally distributed guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) is characterized by having a cranial bony crest (overlain by keratin), but surprisingly little is known about its development. Here, we studied the crest of 202 wild guinea fowl from the same population, using anatomical measurements as well as 2D-morphometry. Our results show that juveniles have smaller skulls than adults and have smaller, simpler crests that are visible even in very young individuals. Among adults, female skulls are smaller than males, and they have smaller, simpler shaped crests, which permit a discrimination between the sexes of 93% when the keratin is preserved with the bony crest, and of 89% when only the bony crest is available. By extrapolation, these results confirm that the crest can be used as an ontogenetic character, as well as for sex discrimination in the fossil record. Our results also show that the overlying keratin does not always mimic the underlying bony crest, which should be considered when reconstructing extinct crested vertebrates.

542,"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Affirmative action is the proactive process of using resources to ensure that people are not discriminated against based on their group membership, such as gender or ethnicity. It is an effective way to reduce discrimination, but attitudes toward affirmative action are often negative, especially in groups implementing affirmative action. Previous research identified different influences on attitudes toward affirmative action, but mainly unchangeable ones. We focus on the influence of abstract thinking on support for affirmative action because abstract thinking is a changeable characteristic that can direct attention to the purpose of affirmative action policies. Across five studies with U.S. MTurk workers—focusing on women as the target group, but including other target groups as well—we show that thinking abstractly improves attitudes toward affirmative action. We observe this effect using correlational (Study 1, n = 251) and experimental (Studies 2–5, ns = 201–515) designs. Additionally, we test whether perceived discrimination increases the impact of abstract thinking on attitudes toward affirmation action (Studies 2–5). We report a meta-analysis across our studies. Overall, thinking abstractly about affirmative action clearly leads to more favorable attitudes toward it, and this effect is somewhat stronger when discrimination is perceived to be high. Consequently, companies and policymakers that would like to increase support for affirmative action policies could use abstract thinking to do so, for example by encouraging employees to think about and discuss why (vs. how) affirmative action policies are implemented.",2020-04-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,1,82,Abstract Thinking Increases Support for Affirmative Action,2,,10.1007/s11199-019-01068-2,Springer,542,Sex Roles,2019.0,88.0,0.0,,4027226,A.

544,"© John Benjamins Publishing CompanyThis paper reports the findings of a study on the mechanics of insult-retort adjacency pairs in Twitter interactions. The analysis concerns primarily the humorous retorts made by the pornographic entrepreneur Stormy Daniels, who has been pelted with politically-loaded misogynist insults, many of which qualify as slut-shaming. These acts of verbal aggression are the result of her involvement in a legal dispute with President Donald Trump and his former attorney. Based on a carefully collected corpus of public exchanges of tweets, our qualitative analysis achieves a few goals. First, it brings to focus a previously ignored function of witty and creative humour, including the self-deprecating variety, as a powerful rhetorical strategy that helps address insults with dignity and that displays the speaker's intellectual superiority over the attacker and a good sense of humour, as evidenced by multiple users' positive metapragmatic evaluations of Stormy Daniels's retorts. Second, these findings carry vital practical implications for handling misogynist comments, including slut-shaming, online.

Social theories suggest that discrimination is a pathway through which gender inequalities affect women's lives, but data are lacking. This cohort study evaluates whether perceived gender discrimination is linked to depressive symptoms among child-bearing women. Methods: Data were obtained from 4,688 participants enrolled in pregnancy in 1991–92 in the European Longitudinal Cohort Study of Pregnancy and Childhood, Czech Republic. Perceived gender discrimination was assessed in mid-pregnancy, year seven, and year eleven. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at eight time-points between mid-pregnancy and year eleven post-delivery. Linear mixed error-component models of depressive symptoms were estimated. Findings: Perceived gender discrimination, reported by 10.7% of women, was related to higher depressive symptoms, both in the unadjusted analysis (b = 0.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12, 0.19], p < 0.001) and in the fully adjusted model (b = 0.12 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.16], p < 0.001). Covariates linked to higher depressive symptoms included financial hardship (b = 0.12 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.14], p < 0.001), childhood emotional/physical neglect (b = 0.18 [95% CI: 0.14, 0.22], p < 0.001), and childhood sexual abuse (b = 0.04 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.06], p < 0.001); an inverse relationship was evident for social support (−0.05 [95% CI: −0.07, −0.04], p < 0.001) and having a partner who performs female-stereotypical household tasks (b=−0.03 [95% CI: −0.05, −0.01], p = 0.001).

549,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The detection and processing of chemical stimuli involve coordinated neuronal networks that process sensory information. This allows animals, such as the model species Drosophila melanogaster, to detect food sources and to choose a potential mate. In peripheral olfactory tissues, several classes of proteins are acting to modulate the detection of chemosensory signals. This includes odorant-binding proteins together with odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs). These enzymes, which primarily act to eliminate toxic compounds from the whole organism also modulate chemodetection. ODEs are thought to neutralize the stimulus molecule concurrently to its detection, avoiding receptor saturation thus allowing chemosensory neurons to respond to the next stimulus. Here, we show that one UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT36E1) expressed in D. melanogaster antennal olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) is involved in sex pheromone discrimination. UGT36E1 overexpression caused by an insertion mutation affected male behavioral ability to discriminate sex pheromones while it increased OSN electrophysiological activity to male pheromones. Reciprocally, the decreased expression of UGT36E1, controlled by an RNAi transgene, improved male ability to discriminate sex pheromones whereas it decreased electrophysiological activity in the relevant OSNs. When we combined the two genotypes (mutation and RNAi), we restored wild-type-like levels both for the behavioral discrimination and UGT36E1 expression. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that this UGT plays a pivotal role in Drosophila pheromonal detection.",2020-03-01,Journal,Article,Genes,19700188368,9,11,Modulation of sex pheromone discrimination by a UDP-glycosyltransferase in Drosophila melanogaster,1,true,10.3390/genes11030237,MDPI AGPostfachBaselCH-4005rasetti@mdpi.com,549,Genes,2020.0,74.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results strongly suggest that this UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT36E1) plays a pivotal role in Drosophila pheromonal detection.'}",5471148,S.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The exposure of adult children to inter-parental violence is an indirect form of victimization which has not been widely investigated in relation to its consequences in adulthood. The main goal of this study was to analyze predictors of dating violence based on an integrated model of intergenerational transmission of violence with the assessment of potential indirect effects of inter-parental violence exposure on dating violence through child-to-parent violence and sexism. A total of 847 college students participated in this study, ranging from 18 to 25 years of age. Interparental violence exposure plays a relevant role in dating violence, with indirect effects through child-to-parent violence and sexism.

This review advances established work on sociocultural processes by showing how people's need for relationship security is also central to the sources and functions of sexism. Men's hostile sexism—overtly derogatory attitudes toward women—involves insecurities about women exploiting men's relational dependence. Accordingly, men's hostile sexism predicts relational aggression when their dependence on partners is risky. Men's benevolent sexism—patronizing and protective attitudes toward women—offers men relationship security by idealizing traditional gender roles in romantic relationships. Benevolent sexism also appeals to women who seek the security of a devoted partner, but requires women to invest in their relationship at the expense of their independence.

553,"© 2020Background: Reported traditional gender role attitudes (GRAs) have been related to worse mental health in western countries. This study examined the link of GRAs with symptoms of depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in two Russian cities. Methods: We used interview data from the cross-sectional Know Your Heart Study conducted among 5099 adults aged 35-69 in the Russian cities of Arkhangelsk and Novosibirsk between 2015 and 2017. Attitudes about gender inequality and division of labour between women and men at home or in the public sphere were measured by single items. Binary variables indicating presence of symptoms of depression and GAD were defined by a cut-off of ≥ 5 of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine crude and adjusted associations. Results: There was evidence that all types of GRAs were associated with symptoms of depression and GAD consistent with a U-shape after controlling for confounding with stronger evidence for all relationships for depression than for GAD. Odds of depressive symptoms were elevated among participants strongly agreeing to gender inequality and gender division of labour. There was good evidence for effect measure modification by age. Limitations: The possibilities of measurement error of the exposure and outcomes, residual confounding and reverse causality are important limitations of this study.

What accounts for their ongoing loyalty, particularly when Republican candidates and leaders fail to embody closely held moral standards around sexual monogamy and propriety, as Donald Trump did in 2016? To answer this question, I draw on research about social sorting and polarization, as well as gender and religion gaps in public opinion, to theorize about the nature of the cross-pressures partisans may experience as a result of the religious and gender identifications they hold. Using data from the 2016 American National Election Study, I evaluate whether cross-cutting identities have a moderating effect on partisans’ thinking about gender issues, their evaluations of the presidential candidates, and their relationship to the parties. I find only modest evidence that gender and evangelical identification impact political thinking among white Republicans, including their reactions to the Access Hollywood tape. Other groups, however, experienced more significant cross-pressures in 2016. Both evangelical Democrats and secular Republicans reported less polarized affective reactions to the presidential candidates and the parties.

555,"© 2019Background: In the past decade, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has responded to a dramatic increase in women veterans seeking care by expanding Women's Health training to more than 5,000 women's health primary care providers and changing the culture of the VA to be more inclusive of women veterans. These initiatives have resulted in increased patient satisfaction and quality of care, but have focused mostly on primary care settings. Less is known about women's experiences in specialty care within VA. This qualitative study sought to examine women veterans' experiences with VA specialty care providers, with a focus on cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and mental health care settings. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 80 women veterans who served during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts at four VA facilities nationwide. Interviews focused on understanding women veterans’ experiences with VA specialty care providers, including their perceptions of gender bias. Results: Four major themes emerged from interviews, including that 1) women did not feel that VA specialty care providers listened to them or took their symptoms seriously, 2) women were told their health conditions or symptoms were attributable to hormonal fluctuations, 3) women noted differences in care based on whether the VA specialty provider was male or female, and 4) women provided recommendations for how gender-sensitive specialty care might be improved. Conclusions: This study is the first to highlight the perceived gender bias experienced by women veterans in VA specialty care. Women felt that their symptoms were disregarded or diminished by their specialty care providers. Although women veterans report positive experiences within women's health clinics and the primary care setting, their negative experiences in VA specialty care suggest that some providers may harbor unintentional or unconscious gender biases.",2020-03-01,Journal,Article,Women's Health Issues,20122,8,30,Women Veterans’ Experiences with Perceived Gender Bias in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Specialty Care,0,false,10.1016/j.whi.2019.10.003,Elsevier USA,555,Women's health issues,2019.0,35.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Although women veterans report positive experiences within women's health clinics and the primary care setting, their negative experiences in VA specialty care suggest that some providers may harbor unintentional or unconscious gender biases.""}",4831045,K.

557,"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Video games often contain sexist content that may be connected to negative consequences for female video game players, such as internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about women. However, aspects of feminist identification may prevent such negative outcomes from occurring. The present study investigated the relationships among time spent playing video games, internalized misogyny, and the synthesis dimension of feminist identity, which is characterized by embracing the positive aspects of being a woman and incorporating feminine attributes into one’s own unique personality. A total of 319 U.S. female video game players completed measures of media usage, internalized misogyny, and feminist identity. The authors tested a moderation model in which gaming predicted internalized misogyny and synthesis moderated this relationship. Gaming was positively associated with internalized misogyny at lower, but not higher, levels of synthesis. Thus, those who value the positive aspects of womanhood and have thoughtful and realistic perceptions of gender may be resistant to internalizing some harmful beliefs about women perpetuated in games. The present study provides evidence for the potential negative influence of cumulative video game exposure for some women and the protective effect of feminist identity synthesis. Counselors and activists should do work aimed at critically evaluating and challenging gendered messages in video games and affirming women’s gender identities and feminine attributes. Game developers must consider the impact of their content on players and strive to create female characters that are agentic, complex, and competent. Conversely, gamers should avoid supporting games with depthless depictions of women.",2020-03-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,5,82,Female Video Game Players and the Protective Effect of Feminist Identity Against Internalized Misogyny,0,false,10.1007/s11199-019-01055-7,Springer,557,Sex Roles,2019.0,60.0,0.0,,114890053,Keiko M.

Furthermore, in an experiment testing the prosociality bias, a novel prediction of the contagious yawning-empathy hypothesis, dogs did not yawn more in response to a prosocial demonstrator than to an antisocial demonstrator.

Study 2a (N = 100) is a conceptual replication: we used different images of scantily dressed male and female models. Finally, in Study 2b (N = 100), we investigated a boundary condition by presenting to participants photos of the same models as in Study 2a, but fully dressed and non-sexualized. Using mixed-effects models for completely-crossed classified data structures, we investigated the relationship between the inversion effect and the stimulus' asymmetry, sexualization and attractiveness, and the perceivers' self-objectification, sexism, and automatic woman-human association. Study 1 replicated the original results, showing a stronger inversion effect for male photos. However, no difference between male and female stimuli emerged in either Study 2a or 2b. Moreover, the impact of the other variables on the inversion effect was highly unstable across the studies.

We examined a) the impact of wartime stress exposures on later-life functioning and disability in Vietnam-era women veterans and b) the extent to which mental health conditions known to be associated with stress—posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)—are associated with additional later-life functioning and disability. Methods: Data were collected in 2011 to 2012 using a mail survey and telephone interview of 4219 women veterans who were active duty during the Vietnam Era. Health functioning was assessed using the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey, and disability was assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Wartime exposures were assessed using the Women’s War-Zone Stressor Scale—Revised; the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0 was used to assess PTSD, MDD, and GAD. Results: Several wartime stress exposures—including job-related pressures, dealing with death, and sexual discrimination and harassment—were associated with worse later-life health (β ranges, −0.04 to −0.26 for functioning, 0.05 to 0.30 for disability). Current PTSD was linked with lower health functioning (physical, β = −0.06; mental, β = −0.15) and greater disability (β = 0.14).

Methods: An online sample of 125 participants were recruited and asked to rate their video game playing experience, complete a trait aggression scale and record responses to a vignette about rape. Scores were first correlated, and then hierarchical multiple regression was employed followed by PROCESS examination of interactions between sexualised game content and trait aggression. Results: Exposure to sexualised content in video games was neither correlated with higher sexist attitude ratings nor with lower empathy scores. Sexualised content in games was associated with slightly lower sexist belief scores for those with higher scores on trait aggression (the 12.8% of our current sample at one standard deviation above the mean). No effects were observed for those low in trait aggression. Conclusions and Implications: While it is natural to be concerned about the impact of potentially arousing video games, actual effects may be counterintuitive, so if seeking to regulate, it is important to act from actual information. Further research with groups of particular concern will be important.",2020-02-01,Journal,Article,Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health,14958,5,30,"Sexualised video games, sexist attitudes and empathy towards victims of rape: Correlational evidence for a relationship is minimal in an online study",2,,10.1002/cbm.2138,"John Wiley and Sons LtdSouthern GateChichester, West SussexPO19 8SQvgorayska@wiley.com",564,Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health,2020.0,36.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Exposure to sexualised content in video games was neither correlated with higher sexist attitude ratings nor with lower empathy scores, and actual effects may be counterintuitive, so if seeking to regulate, it is important to act from actual information.'}",145413059,C.

During the 2016 United States (N = 24,863) and 2017 United Kingdom (N = 2,609) electoral campaigns, we compared participants’ beliefs about the gender of the next head of government with their use and interpretation of pronouns referring to the next head of government.

567,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdRecent studies have shown that pre-existing contextual information, such as gender stereotypes, is incorporated online during comprehension (e.g., Van Berkum, van den Brink, Tesink, Kos, & Hagoort, 2008). Stereotypes, however, are not static entities, and social role theory suggests that they may be influenced by the behavior of members of the group (Eagly, 1987). Consequently, our study examines how gender stereotypes affect the semantic processing of statements from both a male and a female speaker, as well as investigating how the influence of stereotypes may change as listeners gain experience with individual speakers. Participants listened to male and female speakers produce sentences about stereotypically feminine (fashion) and stereotypically masculine (sports) topics. Half of the participants heard a stereotype congruent pattern of sentences (e.g., for the male speaker, semantic errors about fashion but no semantic errors on sports sentences) and the other half heard a stereotype incongruent pattern. We found that the N400 effect of semantic correctness is larger in stereotype incongruent conditions. Furthermore, in stereotype congruent conditions, only stimuli presented in the male voice show an N400 effect in the expected direction (larger N400s to semantic violations). Additionally, when we examined ERP changes over the course of the experiment, we found that the degree of change in amplitude was predicted by individual differences in ambivalent sexism. These results suggest that not only are speaker characteristics incorporated during online language processing, but also that social knowledge influences language processing in a manner congruent with social role theory.",2020-02-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Neurolinguistics,16750,5,53,Male fashionistas and female football fans: Gender stereotypes affect neurophysiological correlates of semantic processing during speech comprehension,0,false,10.1016/j.jneuroling.2019.100876,Elsevier Ltd,567,Journal of Neurolinguistics,2020.0,41.0,0.0,,48171715,A.

569,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdVaccines for two viruses which cause cancer, human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), are recommended for all children in the United States. Numerous parallels exist between the two vaccines in addition to their roles in cancer prevention, including transmission through sexual contact, multiple doses needed for series completion, and vaccine administration in adolescence for HPV and in the initial phase of the HBV vaccination program. All of these factors were viewed as potential barriers to achieving high rates of coverage, yet the ultimate success of the HBV vaccination program led to predictions that similarly high rates of coverage could be achieved for the HPV vaccine. However, currently, only the recommendation for HBV vaccination is supported by mandates for school entry in most states. Uptake of the HPV vaccine has lagged far behind U.S. goals for public health promotion. The aim of this paper is to examine factors which may account for the divergent pathways of the two vaccines. Four main factors are identified: logistical challenges of vaccine administration, attitudes of parents and healthcare providers, safety concerns, and cost. For each factor examined, recommendations are offered to confront similar barriers likely to arise for future vaccines. The authors conclude that gender-neutral state mandates coupled with school-located vaccination programs, stronger gender-neutral messaging from pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers, and younger age of vaccine administration, if approved, present the most promising approaches to improving uptake of the HPV vaccine, and similar vaccines down the road.",2020-01-29,Journal,Review,Vaccine,21376,5,38,Comparison of the implementation of human papillomavirus and hepatitis B vaccination programs in the United States: Implications for future vaccines,0,false,10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.073,Elsevier Ltd,569,Vaccine,2019.0,105.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Gender-neutral state mandates coupled with school-located vaccination programs, stronger gender-neutral messaging from pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers, and younger age of vaccine administration, if approved, present the most promising approaches to improving uptake of the HPV vaccine, and similar vaccines down the road.'}",143740403,Catherine Constable,145315702,A.

Literature has shown that advantaged group members can promote social change but also perpetuate status quo. We conducted three studies to examine two motivational processes that may lead men to confront sexism: an egalitarian path and a paternalistic one. Studies 1–3 revealed that men high in benevolent sexism were more willing to confront sexism for paternalistic reasons, whereas Studies 2–3 found that men high in feminist identification were more likely to confront sexism for egalitarian reasons. Pooled analyses (Studies 1–3) supported the egalitarian and paternalistic paths underlying sexism confrontation. Moreover, Studies 2 and 3 extended these findings to collective action and engagement in the men’s activist movement that aims to reflect on male privilege (i.e., the Men for Equity movement).

572,"© 2013 IEEE.During the last decade, hateful and sexist content towards women is being increasingly spread on social networks. The exposure to sexist speech has serious consequences to women's life and limits their freedom of speech. Previous studies have focused on identifying hatred or violence towards women. However, sexism is expressed in very different forms: it includes subtle stereotypes and attitudes that, although frequently unnoticed, are extremely harmful for both women and society. In this work, we propose a new task that aims to understand and analyze how sexism, from explicit hate or violence to subtle expressions, is expressed in online conversations. To this end, we have developed and released the first dataset of sexist expressions and attitudes in Twitter in Spanish (MeTwo) and investigate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques (both traditional and novel deep learning models) for automatically detecting different types of sexist behaviours. Our results show that sexism is frequently found in many forms in social networks, that it includes a wide range of behaviours, and that it is possible to detect them using deep learning approaches.

573,"© 2020 The authors.We investigated how sexism affected leadership in mixed-gender alpine climbing-dyads. We asked whether benevolent sexism would impair, and hostile sexism would increase (as a form of resistance) women’s leadership; and whether benevolent sexism would increase men’s leadership (as a form of paternalism). A correlational study assessed reported leading behaviour of alpine climbers. Then a vignette-based experiment presented climbers with cross-gender targets, of which three were sexist (non-feminist), and one feminist (non-sexist), and assessed leading intentions depending on targets’ and participants’ gender attitudes. Findings showed that women endorsing benevolent sexism indicated lower leading intentions with targets expressing benevolent sexism (i.e., benevolent and ambivalent men) as compared to hostile sexist men. Moreover, women’s benevolent sexism negatively affected their leading intentions with men endorsing the same gender ideology. Unexpectedly, women with low endorsement of hostile sexism reported higher leading intentions with a hostile sexist man than an ambivalent one, and with an ambivalent than a benevolent man. Conversely, men intended to lead more with female targets who expressed benevolent sexism, accommodating these women’s expectations. Further, men intended to lead more with ambivalent women, than with women deviating from gender stereotypes (i.e., feminist women, or hostile sexist women – who lack expected benevolence based on gender stereotypes). We conclude that benevolent sexism likely reinforces traditional gender roles in a leadership context when men face women who fit the gender stereotype; and when women are benevolently sexist, themselves.

575,"© Oxford University Press 2020.The book explores how personal hatred can foster domestic violence and emotional abuse; how hate-proneness is a main contributor to the aggressive tendencies of borderlines, narcissists, psychopaths, and hatemongers; how seemingly ordinary people embark on some of history’s worst hate crimes; and how cohesive groups can develop extremist viewpoints that motivate hate crimes, mass shootings, and genocide. The book’s first part explores hate in personal relationships, looking for an answer to the question of why our personal relationships can survive hate and resentment but not disrespect or contempt. It shows that where contempt creates an irreparable power imbalance, hate is tied to fear, which our brains may reinterpret as thrill, attraction, and arousal. But this can also make hate a dangerous emotion that convinces people to hang on to abusive relationships. When tied to vengeance and the dark triad of personality, hate is not only dangerous but also dehumanizing. Vengeance and the dark personalities are not essential to hate, however. Without them, hate can have more admirable ends. The book’s second part explores the polarizing forces that can bias cohesive groups of like-minded individuals and contribute to what is effectively a hate crisis. Drawing on history, politics, legal theory, philosophy, and psychology, it shows how cultural myths about femininity, ethnic groups, and the land of opportunity perpetuate misogyny, racism, white supremacy, and anti-Semitism.

576,"© 2020 American Psychological AssociationThe potential of sexist jokes in comedy to harm women has been a matter of intense public debate. Psychological research on sexist comedy is scarce and inconclusive. Theory on social identity threat suggests that communicating devaluation and negative group stereotypes impairs the performance of members of a targeted group: Do women exposed to sexism in stand-up comedy score worse in subsequent cognitive tasks compared with women’s performance after watching nonsexist comedy? In four experiments, we examined women’s performance on numerical and figural intelligence subtests after watching sexist comedy as compared with nonsexist comedy. In Experiment 1 (n = 102) and Experiment 4 (n = 81), the test performance of women who watched sexist stand-up comedy clips suffered. Experiments 2 (n = 181) and 3 (n = 100) showed mixed evidence (see online supplemental materials). A mini meta-analysis reveals a small but significant negative overall effect (d = −.27). Self-reported perceived humor (state) and coping sense of humor (trait) did not consistently moderate the influence of sexist comedy. Insights gained from analyses of emotional responses, assessed both via self-reports and a facial coding software, were limited. We discuss implications for identity-threat theory and for using disparaging humor in comedy.

578,"© ECGBL 2020.All right reserved.Sexism in digital games has received a lot of attention in recent research. Most such studies are addressing the perception of sexist content in games and the attitude in gaming communities. This article analyses the digital game Behind Every Great One, which portraits benevolent sexism, i.e. sexism that may appear positive but that has a damaging effect. What is unique with this game is that it is played from the victim's perspective, a housewife. The article presents an inductive analysis of the game using a triangulation of three different methods: a textual analysis, a player study, and an interview with the developer. The result shows that the game manages to convey benevolent sexism to players and evoke empathy for the victim. This is achieved through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and visual and musical aesthetics. For example, the physical space available for the protagonist is constantly shrinking and crying is used as a powerful mechanics in the game. The player needs to find an empty space for the protagonist to cry and this provides insight into her emotional state. Through the game, the developer reflects upon his own behaviour towards women and the consequences it might have had for them. In particular how his, and other men's, self-absorption forces their female partners into an undesirable social role, in which their needs are constantly neglected. The combination of a meaningful gameplay and the use of game mechanics to convey a message lead us to suggest that the gameplay can be characterized as a persuasive meaningful play.

The article presents an inductive analysis of the game using a triangulation of three different methods: a textual analysis, a player study, and an interview with the developer. The result shows that the game manages to convey benevolent sexism to players and evoke empathy for the victim. This is achieved through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and visual and musical aesthetics. For example, the physical space available for the protagonist is constantly shrinking and crying is used as a powerful mechanics in the game. The player needs to find an empty space for the protagonist to cry and this provides insight into her emotional state. Through the game, the developer reflects upon his own behaviour towards women and the consequences it might have had for them. In particular how his, and other men's, self-absorption forces their female partners into an undesirable social role, in which their needs are constantly neglected. The combination of a meaningful gameplay and the use of game mechanics to convey a message lead us to suggest that the gameplay can be characterized as a persuasive meaningful play. The game has a potential to be used in educational environments as a starting point for discussions regarding gender roles and benevolent sexism.",2020-01-01,Conference Proceeding,Conference Paper,Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning,21100293202,0,2020September,Crying in the game-an inductive analysis of a game that portraits benevolent sexism,,,10.34190/GBL.20.046,Dechema e.V.,583,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
584,"© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Sexism, a pervasive form of oppression, causes profound suffering through various manifestations. Given the rising number of experiences of sexism reported online, categorizing these recollections automatically can aid the fight against sexism, as it can facilitate effective analyses by gender studies researchers and government officials involved in policy making. In this paper, we explore the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism wherein the approach goes beyond merely fine-tuning pre-trained models using unlabeled data. We devise self-training based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. Several proposed methods outperform a variety of baselines on a recently released dataset for multi-label sexism categorization across several standard metrics.",2020-01-01,Book Series,Conference Paper,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),25674,1,12343 LNCS,Fine-grained Multi-label Sexism Classification Using Semi-supervised Learning,0,false,10.1007/978-3-030-62008-0_37,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,584,Congreso Internacional de Tecnologías e Innovación,2020.0,32.0,0.0,,1752477854,Mar Cánovas-García,1409250207,J.

Furthermore, identifying hate speech towards women is specially complex due to the cultural background and the subtlety that characterizes it, which makes it interesting to consider it as a phenomenon by itself, differentiating it from traditional hate speech.

588,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.Detecting hate speech in the workplace is a unique classification task, as the underlying social context implies a subtler version of conventional hate speech. Applications regarding a state-of-the-art workplace sexism detection model include aids for Human Resources departments, AI chatbots and sentiment analysis. Most existing hate speech detection methods, although robust and accurate, focus on hate speech found on social media, specifically Twitter. The context of social media is much more anonymous than the workplace, therefore it tends to lend itself to more aggressive and “hostile” versions of sexism. Therefore, datasets with large amounts of “hostile” sexism have a slightly easier detection task since “hostile” sexist statements can hinge on a couple words that, regardless of context, tip the model off that a statement is sexist. In this paper we present a dataset of sexist statements that are more likely to be said in the workplace as well as a deep learning model that can achieve state-of-the art results. Previous research has created state-of-the-art models to distinguish “hostile” and “benevolent” sexism based simply on aggregated Twitter data.

An interesting finding is that the models trained by the data of an actor/actress only achieve similar performance on the data of another gender without performance loss.

Secondly, technology can deny women institutional access, as increasingly widespread algorithms are shown to underperform on marginalised groups.

596,"© 2020 Russsian Psychological Society.Background. Rape myths are usually described as a widely-accepted set of false beliefs and attitudes about victims and perpetrators of sexual assault. These beliefs serve to deny, downplay, or justify sexual violence that men commit against women. The Acceptance of Modern Myths about Sexual Aggression (AMMSA) scale assesses those stereotypical beliefs about sexual aggression in a more subtle way than traditional measurements of rape myths, which often use rather blatant wording. Objective. To develop a Russian version of the sixteen-item AMMSA scale. Design. Our design was non-experimental. Participants were recruited online. In total, data of 270 Russian female participants and 131 German female participants were analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed using correlational analyses with other constructs that are believed to be related to AMMSA to different degrees (hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, traditional gender role preferences, and impression management). Results. It was found that the Russian AMMSA, just like the German AMMSA, was unidimensional, normally distributed, had high internal consistency, and showed good construct validity. Conclusion. The validation of a Russian version of the AMMSA forms an important first step for studying beliefs about sexual aggression in Russian society.

Method Eligible for inclusion were newly admitted outpatients age 6-17 years (n = 5908) in four Swedish child- and adolescent psychiatry clinics. They were prompted consecutively and n = 307 accepted a specific day for assessment until time slots randomly were filled. We prospectively validated the MFQ (33 items) and SMFQ (13 items) in patients (n = 186) using receiver operating characteristics against a reference test of Longitudinal Expert All Data DSM-IV depression based on a Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and 1.2 (sd.6) years of follow-up. Results A depressive disorder was confirmed in 59 (31.7%) patients ranging from 14.0% for girls 6-12 years to 53.3% for girls 13-17 years. SMFQ performed roughly equivalent to MFQ. Adolescent score on SMFQ discriminated fairly for boys with Area Under Curve.77 (95% confidence interval.59-.81) and good (.82,.69-.91) for girls and parent ratings for adolescent girls (.85,.73-.93), but not for boys. Depression in children below age 13 could not be discriminated by MFQ or SMFQ whether filled in by child and mostly also when filled in by parent. Favouring maximum kappa value, the optimal cut-off was for MFQ self-report girls ≥32 versus boys ≥11 and for SMFQ self-report girls ≥17 versus boys ≥ 6. Suggested clinical SMFQ cut-offs for girls were ≥12 and for boys ≥ 6.

Amongst potential modulators are individual's genetic background as well as being female. Our aim was to evaluate gender bias and genotype-related influence on opioid titration safety, in chronic low back pain (CLBP), as the most frequent chronic non-cancer pain. Methods: A 3 years, prospective study, was developed in opioids naïve CLBP patients. Data was self-reported by patients (pain [Visual Analogy Scale, VAS], adverse events [AEs], and healthcare resources utilization) and physicians (analgesic prescription, morphine equivalent daily dose [MEDD] and suspected adverse drug reactions [ADRs]). Outcomes were analyzed as patients with AEs (case) or without (control) together with patients' gender and genotype. Gene variants in OPRM1 (rs1799971), COMT (rs4680), ABCB1 (rs1045642), UGT2B7 (rs12233719 and rs7438135), KCNJ6 (rs2070995 and rs6517442) and CYP3A5∗3 (rs776746) were assessed. Hospital Ethics Committee approved the study and statistical analyses were performed with R v.3.2.4. Results: A total of 179 patients were included (64% female, mean pain intensity 73±16 mm) and 90% of them presented at least one AE (median of 3 (1-6) AEs/patient) with a rate of 5 AEs: 1 ADR without differences due to gender. However, there is a significant delay in referral of female patients (a mean of six years) to Pain Unit, being significantly 3 to 5 more likely to present sleep or psychiatric disorders. Meanwhile males showed more sexual and reproductive system disorders. Genotypes influenced skin (COMT, G472A-GG) and gastrointestinal (ABCB1, C3435T-CC) related problems. Conclusions: A gender bias was evidenced due to a female delay in CLBP diagnostic and therapeutic with a different analgesic drug safety profile.

Three narratives that received a considerable amount of media attention were that sexist, racist, and/or nationalist attitudes influenced voting decisions. Some empirical work has supported each of these accounts. However, sexism, racism, and nationalism are interrelated, and most studies about the 2016 election have not examined these three factors in conjunction to determine the unique contribution of each. Thus, we investigated the extent to which each factor (assessed as sexism toward women, Modern Racism, and U.S. nationalism) was uniquely related to evaluations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, voting intentions, and actual voting behavior. Participants completed online questionnaires before (N = 489) and after (N = 192) the 2016 U.S. election. More positive evaluation of Clinton and intentions to vote for Clinton were associated with lower levels of Modern Racism. More positive evaluation of Trump was associated with greater sexism toward women, Modern Racism, and U.S. nationalism. Intent to vote for Trump was associated with greater sexism toward women and Modern Racism. However, only Modern Racism significantly predicted voting behavior. Greater Modern Racism was associated with greater likelihood of voting for Trump and lower likelihood of voting for Clinton. When considered in conjunction, Modern Racism was the most consistent predictor across the different election outcome variables. Sexism toward women and U.S. nationalism were generally not significantly related to evaluations, intentions to vote, or voting behavior when accounting for Modern Racism. Thus, our data indicate that Modern Racism was correlated with vote choice in the 2016 election.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,4,15,"Sexism, racism, and nationalism: Factors associated with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election results?",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0229432,Public Library of Science,604,PLoS ONE,2020.0,35.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The study highlights the importance of physical exercise test to unmask differentiated behaviors between symptomatic and asymptomatic BS patients through depolarization dynamic analysis and obtains a suitable discrimination performance between groups.'}",1659055425,D.

605,"© 2020 Romero et al.Brugada syndrome (BS) is a genetic pathological condition associated with a high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). Ventricular depolarization disorders have been suggested as a potential electrophysiological mechanism associated with high SCD risk on patients with BS. This paper aims to characterize the dynamic changes of ventricular depolarization observed during physical exercise in symptomatic and asymptomatic BS patients. To this end, cardiac ventricular depolarization features were automatically extracted from 12-lead ECG recordings acquired during standardized exercise stress test in 110 BS patients, of whom 25 were symptomatic. Conventional parameters were evaluated, including QRS duration, R and S wave amplitudes (AR, AS), as well as QRS morphological features, such as up-stroke and down-stroke slopes of the R and S waves (UR, DR and US). The effects of physical exercise and recovery on the dynamics of these markers were assessed in both BS populations. Features showing significantly different dynamics between the studied groups were used alone and in combination with the clinical characteristics of the patients in a logistic regression analysis. Results show larger changes in the second half of the QRS complex through AS and US measured in the right precordial leads for asymptomatic patients, especially during recovery, when the vagal tone is more pronounced. Multivariate analysis involving both types of features resulted in a reduced model of three relevant features (δAS in lead V2, Sex and heart rate recovery, HRR), which achieved a suitable discrimination performance between groups; sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 75% (AUC = 83%). However, after controlling the model for possible confounding factors, only one feature (δAS) remained meaningful. This adjusted model significantly improved the overall discrimination performance by up to: sensitivity = 84% and specificity = 100% (AUC = 94%). The study highlights the importance of physical exercise test to unmask differentiated behaviors between symptomatic and asymptomatic BS patients through depolarization dynamic analysis. This analysis together with the obtained model may help to identify asymptomatic patients at low or high risk of future cardiac events, but it should be confirmed by further prospective studies.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,1,15,Dynamic changes in ventricular depolarization during exercise in patients with Brugada syndrome,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0229078,Public Library of Science,605,BioMed Research International,2020.0,55.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A skull-based sex estimation model in Chinese population is established, providing a scientific reference for the practical application of forensic medicine and anthropology and the accuracy rate of male and female sex discrimination is higher than that of morphological and measurement methods.'}",2121300164,Wen Yang,40426830,Mingquan Zhou,2157152865,Pengfei Zhang,2004567,Guohua Geng,48032488,Xiaoning Liu,2111127150,Haibo Zhang,51.0,318.0,9.0,99.0,852.0,13.0,16.0,363.0,5.0,338.0,16255.0,59.0,780.0,29170.0,85.0,520.0,15259.0,59.0,"Medicine, Computer Science"

In contrast to previous trend studies, which largely ignore age effects, a mechanism-based age-period-cohort model (Winship/Harding 2008) is applied. It becomes clear that age, period and cohort independently have an impact on gender role ideology. Compared to earlier research, new insights concerning the shape of cohort effects come to light: Specific to traditional gender ideology in Western Germany, it is apparent that the trend towards increasingly egalitarian attitudes comes to a halt in men born around 1956 and later and in women born 1966. For Eastern Germany we observe that the cohort-specific trend towards liberalisa-tion in younger cohorts either is diminishing or even tends to reverse.

The aim of this study is to establish a skull-based sex estimation model in Chinese population, providing a scientific reference for the practical application of forensic medicine and anthropology. We take the superior orbital margin and frontal bone of the skull as the research object and proposed a technology of objective sex estimation of the skull using wavelet transform and Fourier transform. Firstly, the supraorbital margin and frontal bone were quantified by wavelet transform and Fourier transform, and then the extracted features were classified by SVM, and the model was tested. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate of male and female sex discrimination is 90.9% and 94.4%, respectively, which is higher than that of morphological and measurement methods.

At present, and despite the fact that in Western countries sexism manifests itself in more subtle ways, it is found that a portion of the population continues to harbor sexist beliefs. This work aims to analyze, from a gender perspective, the effect of a series of personal characteristics on the prediction of sexist beliefs in a sample of college students in Spain (N = 2,112, 63.6% women and 36.4% men). To evaluate the degree of sexism, the short version of the Ambivalent Sexism Scale (ASI, Expósito, Moya, & Glick, 1998) was used, on which higher scores represent higher levels of sexism (α =.88). Explanatory variables included age, political ideology, nationality, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, experiences of victimization, and media consumption. The results indicated that men scored significantly higher than women on the ambivalent sexism scale. In addition, higher scores were found for men on the subscales of both hostile and benevolent sexism. On the other hand, the results showed that conservative ideologies and religious faith predict more sexist attitudes in both men and women. However, it was found that the effect of age, political ideology, and sexual orientation depends on the participant’s gender.

614,"© 2018 SESPASObjective: To illustrate some gender challenges and contributions which are more frequent in research and health care through a chronic disease such as spondyloarthritis. Method: Using two of the main identified gender biases in research and health care (de-contextualization of diseases, especially in women, and problem definition and knowledge production in women's health), a cross-sectional study was used with 96 men and 54 women with spondyloarthritis of the Rheumatology Department of the Alicante University General Hospital, whose sources of information were semi-structured patient interviews and clinical records. Results: We show how the gender perspective can contribute to contextualise the differences by sex of functional alterations and other social and health indicators, and highlight inequalities in the socioeconomic repercussions between patients of both sexes. It can contribute towards re-conceptualizing diseases, especially of women, specifying the profile of differential diagnosis according to sex, and provide knowledge about methodological challenges related to diagnostic tests. Conclusions: Achieving scientific and professional excellence in health care is also a gender issue. Analysing from a gender perspective the history of the diseases, how their diagnosis criteria were established and the normality and abnormality cut-off points, especially identified diseases of men, such as spondyloarthritis, is a priority to re-conceptualize medicine; as well as providing information on how the gender norms and values of the context interact with the lives of those who suffer these diseases.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,Gaceta Sanitaria,60803,2,34,Gender perspective in clinical epidemiology.

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 233 Black, White, mixed- and other-race minority children (7–12 years old; Mage = 9.92; 61% girls) in racially diverse schools in the Pacific Northwest.

We worked together with community partners to implement the ‘One Man Can’ intervention in rural Mpumalanga, South Africa to promote gender equality and HIV risk reduction. During the intervention, we conducted longitudinal qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with community mobilizers (n = 26), volunteer community action team members (n = 22) and community members (n = 52) to explore their experience of being part of the intervention and their experiences of change associated with the intervention. The objective of the study was to examine processes of change in community mobilization for gender equity and HIV prevention. Our analysis showed that over time, participants referred to three key elements of their engagement with the intervention: developing respect for others; inter-personal communication; and empathy. These elements were viewed as assisting them in adopting a ‘better life’ and associated with behaviour change in the intervention’s main focus areas of promoting gender equality and HIV risk reduction behaviours. We discuss how these concepts relate to the essential domains contained within our theoretical framework of community mobilization—specifically critical consciousness, shared concerns and social cohesion -, as demonstrated in this community.

619,"© 2019 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for AdolescentsIntroduction: The current study addresses how sexualizing online media practices, i.e., exposure to sexually explicit internet material and receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, relate to the acceptance of sexist attitudes among adolescents. Specifically, it extends previous research on the acceptance of rape myths by exploring a construct related to these beliefs, i.e., resistance towards the metoo-movement. Methods: The study is based on a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey among 568 Flemish adolescents (15–18 years old, Mage = 16.4, SD = .98, 58.3% girls) that measured adolescents’ sexualizing online media use, sexist attitudes and objectification processes. Results: The results showed that exposure to sexually explicit internet material, but not receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, was related to more resistance towards the metoo-movement and the acceptance of rape myths through notions of women as sex objects. Self-objectification did not function as a valid mediator in the examined relations. Gender and self-esteem did not moderate the proposed relations. Conclusions: The findings underline the role of media use in how adolescents develop sexist beliefs and, more precisely, beliefs about contemporary actions to combat sexism, i.e., the metoo-movement. The present study showed that sexual objectification fueled by sexually explicit internet material may result in less positive attitudes and, thus, more resistance towards this movement.",2019-12-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Adolescence,25655,14,77,#(Me)too much?

620,"© 2019 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.Importance: Sex-based income disparities are well documented in medicine and most pronounced in surgery. These disparities are commonly attributed to differences in hours worked. One proposed solution to close the earnings gap is a fee-for-service payment system, which is theoretically free of bias. However, it is unclear whether a sex-based earnings gap persists in a fee-for-service system when earnings are measured on the basis of hours worked. Objective: To determine whether male and female surgeons have similar earnings for each hour spent operating in a fee-for-service system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, population-based study used administrative databases from a fee-for-service, single-payer health system in Ontario, Canada. Surgeons who submitted claims for surgical procedures performed between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, were included. Data analysis took place from February 2018 to December 2018. Exposures: Surgeon sex. Main Outcomes and Measures: This study compared earnings per hour spent operating between male and female surgeons and earnings stratified by surgical specialty in a matched analysis. We explored factors potentially associated with earnings disparities, including differences in procedure duration and type between male and female surgeons and hourly earnings for procedures performed primarily on male vs female patients. Results: We identified 1508471 surgical procedures claimed by 3275 surgeons. Female surgeons had practiced fewer years than male surgeons (median [interquartile range], 8.4 [2.9-16.6] vs 14.7 [5.9-25.7] years; P <.001), and the largest proportion of female surgeons practiced gynecology (400 of 819 female surgeons [48.8%]). Hourly earnings for female surgeons were 24% lower than for male surgeons (relative rate, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.74-0.79]; P <.001). This disparity persisted after adjusting for specialty and in matched analysis stratified by specialty, with the largest mean differences in cardiothoracic surgery (in US dollars: $59.64/hour) and orthopedic surgery ($55.45/hour). There were no differences in time taken by male and female surgeons to perform common procedures; however, female surgeons more commonly performed procedures with the lowest hourly earnings. Conclusions and Relevance: Even within a fee-for-service system, male and female surgeons do not have equal earnings for equal hours spent working, suggesting that the opportunity to perform the most lucrative surgical procedures is greater for men than women. These findings call for a comprehensive analysis of drivers of sex-based earning disparities, including referral patterns, and highlight the need for systems-level solutions..",2019-12-01,Journal,Article,JAMA Surgery,21100228543,53,154,"Sex-Based Disparities in the Hourly Earnings of Surgeons in the Fee-for-Service System in Ontario, Canada",2,,10.1001/jamasurg.2019.3769,American Medical Associationsmcleod@itsa.ucsf.edu,620,Scientific Reports,2019.0,111.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This qualitative study in rural Nepal explored how behavioral expectations differed based on gender role, gender discrimination, inequity, and treatment of children based on their gender identity.'}",40586000,Julia Langer,31892482,J.

621,"© 2019, The Author(s).Whereas epidemiologic studies consistently identify different rates and types of problematic behavior in boys and girls, there has been little research examining the ecocultural context in which these gender differences in child behavior problems develop, especially in non-Western settings. This qualitative study in rural Nepal explored how behavioral expectations differed based on gender role, gender discrimination, inequity, and treatment of children based on their gender identity. We conducted semi-structured interviews with a total of 14 parents, school workers, and community leaders from a village in rural Nepal. Interview transcripts were coded by two authors using predetermined and emergent codes to identify expectations, behavior problems, and responses to behavior problems, stratified by gender. Authors then arranged codes into categories based on emergent themes. Four major themes in the interviews were identified: (1) self-reported gender non-bias; (2) differentiated role expectations; (3) gender, “goodness”, and differential thresholds for problem behaviors; and (4) boys and girls require different responses for misbehavior. Results from our study in Nepal reflect nearly universal models of gender differences in behavior. Of particular importance in South Asia, patrilocal marital practices were used to frame gender differences in expectations. To protect girls’ future potential to marry, local cultural practices provide girls with lesser opportunities and less cultural space to conduct themselves in a disruptive manner than boys.

This trend has also been found to apply to topical minoxidil, a common treatment for male and female pattern hair loss. Objective: We sought to identify the gender-related price discrepancies of facial moisturizers, which are routinely recommended by dermatologists. Methods: Three online retailers (Amazon, Target, and Walmart) were surveyed for available facial moisturizers in October 2018. Facial moisturizers were classified as men's, women's, or gender-neutral based on three specific marketing variables: language, container color/graphics, and container curvature/shape. Results: In total, 110 facial moisturizers were included in this analysis. Of the 54 facial moisturizers evaluated for men, 47 (87%) contained the word “men” within the marketing language, while only three of 56 (5.4%) facial moisturizers targeted at women were explicitly labeled “for women.” No statistically significant difference was found between the number of facial moisturizers listed as fragrance-free, SPF-containing, anti-aging, or those labeled as sensitive, hypoallergenic, or dermatologist recommended between the two groups. However, facial moisturizers marketed to women were on average $3.09 more per ounce than those marketed to men. A two-tailed t test revealed a statistically significant difference between the price per ounce of facial moisturizers for men ($6.20) and those for women ($9.29) (P = 0.013).

Understanding the cultural factors that are associated with disparities in harassment, discrimination, remuneration, and career trajectory are critical to addressing inequities. Objectives: To explore how physicians perceive the climate for women physicians and compare perceptions and experiences of gender inequity among physicians based on characteristics including gender, faculty status, parental status, and years in practice. Design, Setting, and Participants: This sequential, explanatory, mixed-methods qualitative study used the Culture Conducive to Women's Academic Success (CCWAS; range 45-225, with higher scores indicating better perceived culture toward women), followed by individual semistructured interviews with physicians at the Department of Medicine of the University of Calgary. All 389 physician members of the Department of Medicine, including academic and clinical physicians and those of any gender, were invited to participate in the survey and interview phases. Main Outcomes and Measures: The culture within the department for women physicians was assessed using the CCWAS score. Scores were compared between respondents' gender and years in practice. Interviews with physicians were used to further explore findings from the CCWAS and to understand experiences and perceptions of gender disparities. Results: A total of 169 of 389 physicians completed the survey (response rate, 43.4%; 102 [59.9%] women; 65 [38.9%] men; and 2 [1.2%] who did not disclose gender); 28 participants (7.2%) elected to participate in an interview (22 [78.6%] women; 6 [21.4%] men). Women physicians perceived the culture of the department toward women as significantly worse than men physicians (median [interquartile range] CCWAS score, 137.0 [118.0-155.0] vs 164.5 [154.0-183.4]; P <.001). Physicians with more than 15 years in practice perceived the culture toward women as significantly more favorable than physicians with 15 years or less in practice (median [interquartile range] CCWAS score, 157.0 [138.8-181.3] vs 147.0 [127.5-164.3]; P =.02). Qualitative data demonstrated that experiences of junior women (ie, physicians who graduated medical school after 1996, when an equal number of men and women in medical school was achieved in Canada) and perceptions of senior men (ie, those who graduated before 1996) were most different; junior women reported high rates of discrimination and harassment, while senior men perceived that the Department of Medicine had achieved gender equity.

Research suggests that structural interventions and changes are needed to reduce these phenomena and ensure that schools function as protective and secure learning environments for sexual minorities. Aim: This study presents a review of international interventions/programs focused on reducing bullying and promoting inclusive educational environments for transgender youths. Methods: An extensive literature search in English and Spanish was undertaken using the electronic database of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, SciELO and LILACS (1990–2018). Results: Several international programs, guidelines and projects aimed at preventing bullying against sexual minorities (including the transgender population) in school environments were described. Recommendations and barriers to consider in the development and implementation of bullying prevention interventions in a range of school settings are discussed. Conclusions: Evidence suggest important positive benefits associated with attending schools that have anti-bullying or inclusive policies for gender minorities, such as the improvement of school wellbeing, more positive school climate, decreasing truancy, lower levels of victimization, decreased school harassment and increased feelings of safety.

Acute care surgery models are effective in decreasing mortality and morbidity after emergency surgeries, but sex-based differences in delivery and outcomes have not been explored. Our objective was to explore sex associated differences in the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of those admitted to emergency general surgery. Methods A post-hoc analysis of 512 emergency general surgical patients admitted consecutively to two tertiary care hospitals in Alberta Canada, between April 1, 2014 and July 31, 2015. We measured associations between sex and patient demographics, pre-, intra- and post-operative delivery of care, as well as post-operative outcomes. Findings Of those excluded from the analysis, older females were more likely to undergo conservative management compared to older men (41% vs 34%, p = 0.03). Overall, there were no differences between sexes for time from admission to surgery, time spent in surgery, overall complication rate, mortality, hospital length of stay, or discharge disposition. Women were more likely to have a cancer diagnosis [OR 4.12 (95% CI: 1.61–10.5), p = 0.003, adjusted for age], while men were more likely to receive hernia surgery [OR 2.33 (95% CI 1.35–4.02), p = 0.002, adjusted for age and Charlson Comorbidity Index].

630,"© 2019Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) populations, including those that do not identify with gender binary constructs (man or woman) are increasingly presenting for treatment of posttrauma sequelae. Providers who offer services for trauma survivors including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment should be knowledgeable about evidence-based care and have some cultural familiarity with TGD experiences. Indeed, the Minority Stress Model suggests that the combination of distal and proximal minority stressors can combine to produce increased mental health symptoms as compared with cisgender peers, though this model has yet to be fully tested. Clients often present with a complicated picture of experiences, which include a variety of minority stressors, microaggressions, discrimination, and traumatic events that can all be related to their identity. However, conceptualizations of trauma treatment in the context of extensive minority stress are lacking.

Two online experiments were conducted to determine whether dependency-oriented help, which consists of solving a problem for the beneficiary (Nadler 2002), has negative consequences for female beneficiaries and positive consequences for male helpers (Studies 1 and 2: 100 and 203 U.S. MTurk respondents respectively). I found that observers perceived women who received dependency-oriented help from men as being lower in status (Study 2), competence (Studies 1 and 2), and promotability (Studies 1 and 2) than women who received autonomy-oriented help from men. Contrary to expectations, observers’ endorsement of benevolent sexism moderated these effects such that their evaluations of female beneficiaries of dependency-oriented help was more negative the less they endorsed benevolent sexism (Studies 1 and 2). Finally, observers evaluated helpers who gave dependency-oriented help as lower in status and competence than helpers who give autonomy-oriented help (Study 2).

632,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: The purpose of this study was to characterize implicit gender bias among residents in US Emergency Medicine and OB/GYN residencies. Methods: We conducted a survey of all allopathic Emergency Medicine and OB/GYN residency programs including questions about leadership as well as an implicit association test (IAT) for unconscious gender bias. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the Likert-type survey responses and used standard IAT analysis methods. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors that were associated with implicit bias. We conducted a subgroup analysis of study sites involved in a multi-site intervention study to determine if responses were different in this group. Results: Overall, 74% of the programs had at least one respondent. Out of 14,234 eligible, 1634 respondents completed the survey (11.5%). Of the five sites enrolled in the intervention study, 244 of 359 eligible residents completed the survey (68%). Male residents had a mean IAT score of 0.31 (SD 0.23) and females 0.14 (SD 0.24), both favoring males in leadership roles and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). IAT scores did not differ by postgraduate year (PGY). Multivariable analysis of IAT score and participant demographics confirmed a significant association between female gender and lower IAT score. Explicit bias favoring males in leadership roles was associated with increased implicit bias favoring males in leadership roles (r = 0.1 p < 0.001). Conclusions: We found that gender bias is present among US residents favoring men in leadership positions, this bias differs between male and female residents, and is associated with discipline.

633,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdPsychopathy is associated with a variety of negative attitudes and behaviours towards women; however, the mechanisms that underlie these associations have yet to be fully examined. The current work examined dehumanization, a social-psychological construct, as a potential mechanism facilitating the association between sub-clinical psychopathy and negative attitudes towards women. Two online studies with all-male samples were conducted to examine whether dehumanization helps to explain the association between psychopathy and sexist and violent attitudes towards women. In Study 1 (n = 514), path analyses indicated that psychopathy was indirectly related to sexist and violent attitudes towards women through dehumanization. Study 2 (n = 265) replicated the findings of Study 1 regarding sexism. It also included a date rape analogue measure of violent attitudes and was able to expand on the findings of Study 1, though only for the interpersonal and affective components of psychopathy. These results may suggest that individuals high in psychopathic traits see women as sub-human, this dehumanizing appraisal may be facilitating attitudes and behaviours that are consistent with the idea that women are less than human and deserve to be treated as such. Our results suggest that dehumanization may be an important mechanism for understanding, and potentially mitigating, the association between psychopathy and negative attitudes towards women.",2019-10-15,Journal,Article,Personality and Individual Differences,12807,12,149,"Less than human: psychopathy, dehumanization, and sexist and violent attitudes towards women",0,false,10.1016/j.paid.2019.06.002,Elsevier Ltd,633,Personality and Individual Differences,2019.0,48.0,0.0,,34626431,B.

In particular, we measure general and gender conservatism, as well as the previously unexplored predictors of erotophobia–erotophilia (comfort with sexuality) and quality of previous contact with sexual minorities. In this North American student sample (N = 218), attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (ATLG) correlated strongly with the Transgender Belief Scale (r = 0.82), suggesting a lack of differentiation between sexual minority groups. Multiple regression models indicated that participant gender and conservatism (as measured through homophobia, benevolent sexism and authoritarianism) contributed uniquely to transgender attitude prediction. After excluding the ATLG as a predictor, contact quality with sexual minorities, erotophobia–erotophilia, religious fundamentalism, benevolent sexism, and participant gender emerged as predictors of transgender beliefs.

635,"© 2019 Society of Biological PsychiatryBackground: Women are currently underrepresented in academic psychiatry. As publication activity reflects both leadership and participation in academia, we examined temporal trends in women's authorship by conducting a large-scale bibliometric study of psychiatry journals. Methods: We examined changes in proportions of women in the first, last, and overall authorship positions over time; relationship to journal impact factor and editorial board makeup; and rates of transition to senior author status using original research articles published in the 24 highest-impact psychiatry journals between January 2008 and May 2018. Results: In 30,934 articles, women represented 40.0% of all authors in 2008 and 44.8% in 2018, with a significant increase in the percentage of women as first authors (2008: 43.5%, 2018: 49.5%; B = 0.64, p = .002) and last authors over time (2008: 30.0%, 2018: 35.7%; B = 0.64, p = 1 × 10−5). Articles with women as last authors were significantly more likely than those with men as last authors to have a woman as first author (χ2 1 = 126.1, p < 2.2 × 10−16). Women exhibited slower rates of transition to the last author position (log rank p = 2 × 10−16); time to 10% transition was 5 years for men and 9 years for women. Conclusions: These results indicate continued improvement in the representation of women authors in psychiatry journals, resulting in near parity in first authors. However, slower rates of transition to the senior author position and continued underrepresentation of women as senior authors suggest ongoing challenges in achieving gender parity in academic leadership.

636,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.During the last years, the phenomenon of hate against women increased exponentially especially in online environments such as microblogs. Although this alarming phenomenon has triggered many studies both from computational linguistic and machine learning points of view, less effort has been spent to analyze if those misogyny detection models are affected by an unintended bias. This can lead the models to associate unreasonably high misogynous scores to a non-misogynous text only because it contains certain terms, called identity terms. This work is the first attempt to address the problem of measuring and mitigating unintended bias in machine learning models trained for the misogyny detection task. We propose a novel synthetic test set that can be used as evaluation framework for measuring the unintended bias and different mitigation strategies specific for this task. Moreover, we provide a misogyny detection model that demonstrate to obtain the best classification performance in the state-of-the-art.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Purpose: To investigate whether women and men diagnosed with depressive disorder were managed equally in terms of being sick-leave certified and being prescribed psychoactive drugs. Materials and methods: Data from all patients diagnosed with depression during 2010–2015 in Uppsala county, Sweden (n = 19 448) were used to investigate associations between gender and issued sick-leave certificate, prescriptions of anti-depressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy referrals, at different time points up till 180 days after diagnosis. Results: At diagnosis date, 50.1% were prescribed antidepressants; 14.2% anxiolytics; 13.3% hypnotics or sedatives. Corresponding proportion regarding issue of sick-leave certificate among working aged (18–64 years) was 16.6%. Men had higher odds than women of being prescribed antidepressants (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.09–1.24); anxiolytics (1.10; 95% CI 1.02–1.21), hypnotics and sedatives (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.00–1.19) and lower odds (among those aged 18–64 years) of being sick-leave certified (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.82-0.98) in adjusted regression models. There were subtle changes in ORs for outcomes at 3- and 6-month follow-up periods.

Medical students' interpersonal experiences within the context of medical school may contribute to this bias.

Method: Data were collected by surveying students (n = 2940) from a stratified sample of U.S. medical schools in fall 2010 (first semester of medical school), spring 2014 (final semester of medical school), and spring 2016 (second year of medical residency). Results: Amount and favorability of contact with LGBT individuals, reported during the final semester of medical school, predicted lower levels of explicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Additionally, exposure to negative role modeling, also reported during the final semester of medical school, predicted higher levels of explicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Amount of contact with LGBT individuals – and in particular, with LGBT medical students – predicted lower levels of implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency.

643,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Use of the term male nurse is common in nursing wherever the practice setting may be, but no formal analysis has been done to illuminate the meaning of the concept. The term male nurse is often problematic to those referred to, as the label carries stereotypes that further marginalize this extreme minority in the nursing profession. The Nurse Registration Act of 1919 (UK) banned men from nursing de jure, whilst Nightingale's reform of nursing education established the same de facto years before. This potent mix of tradition and law served as the basis for sex-segregation and feminization of nursing. Fast forward to today—in the centennial of the Nurse Registration Act—women still dominate nursing, and attempts to recruit and retain men into the profession remains to be a very challenging task. Walker and Avant's methodology was utilized in this concept analysis. Seven defining attributes of the male nurse were identified: perceived as a male, credentialed as a nurse, increased visibility, nonconformist as to career choice, cautious caregivers, stereotyped/stigmatized, and increased role strain. Antecedents, consequences, and illustrative cases were also discussed. Gender-based labels such as male nurse are injurious to nursing, as it preserves sex-segregation as well as stereotypes that affect both men and women in the profession.

646,"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.People higher in benevolent sexism often outwardly endorse gender equality, but support men over women for challenging positions and experiences. Reflecting shifting standards (a tendency to evaluate stereotyped group members against within-category judgment standards), people higher in sexism may evaluate prominent women’s competence against a lower competency standard for women (who are stereotyped as less competent than men are), and not against a standard for men. Thus prominent women could be perceived as especially competent (versus other women), yet men might still garner ultimate support. Study 1 tested for this possibility using an ecologically valid example: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Study 1 showed that benevolent (and not hostile) sexism predicted less opposition to Donald Trump’s candidacy and more positive attitudes toward the election outcome among 57 mostly female U.S. college students. Study 1 also showed that benevolent sexism positively predicted competence perceived in Hillary Clinton. To determine if this positive relationship reflected shifting standards, we manipulated the gender to which a prominent woman would be compared in Study 2 with 189 U.S. adults. Reflecting shifting standards, benevolent sexism related to evaluating women as more competent when they were evaluated against other women versus other men. Shifting standards also mediated a relationship between benevolent sexism and expecting lower female success. Using shifting standards may be one way that people higher in benevolent sexism might evaluate prominent women as especially competent, yet ultimately support men.",2019-10-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,8,81,A Crisis of Competence: Benevolent Sexism Affects Evaluations of Women’s Competence,0,false,10.1007/s11199-019-1011-3,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,646,Sex Roles,2019.0,100.0,0.0,,1412902102,A.

647,"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Intimate partner violence against women (IPV) and sexual harassment are both widespread. Research on their causes and attitudinal correlates has rarely examined implicit, automatic cognitive associations related to the partner (in IPV aggressors) or to women (in sexual harassment offenders). The aim of the present research was to study these implicit associations in 129 male German students. Participants completed scales of hostile sexism (HS), masculine gender role stress (MGRS), short-term (STMO) and long-term mating orientation (LTMO), and proclivity to both IPV and sexual harassment. Next they performed a primed lexical decision task that measured whether concepts of violence, power, hostility, and sexuality were differentially associated with representations of women, men, and the participant’s own intimate partner. Results showed that implicit associations of own partner with violence as well as hostility were generally high but did not correlate strongly with the proclivity measures. Furthermore, the proclivity measures were positively predicted by HS, MGRS, and STMO, whereas LTMO negatively predicted IPV proclivity. Practice implications point to the need to address early socialization processes that may shape men’s negative associations with female partners. Some strategies to prevent and reduce these types of implicit associations are discussed.",2019-10-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,4,81,Automatic Associations and Conscious Attitudes Predict Different Aspects of Men’s Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Harassment Proclivities,2,,10.1007/s11199-019-1006-0,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,647,International Journal of Prisoner Health,2019.0,119.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The outcome of this study suggests that within similar structures in the Institute of Mitigated Custody, the theme of sexism should be considered in more depth, and suggests the idea that male sexism can be a factor that can cause recidivism in the antisocial behaviour of prisoners once they have served their sentences.'}",7437221,I.

648,"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Gender inequality and sexism are often at the root of domestic violence against women and children, with both serving to justify male domination. This runs in parallel with mother-blaming bias, which constitutes a pervasive common sense and scientific error derived from the myth of the good and the bad mother, characterising a large part of studies on deviance. The purpose of this paper is to consider the possible role of sexism in prisoners’ deviant biographies; for this, the authors considered the role of the mother in the biographies of prisoners, and the results lend support to the idea that mother-blaming is a serious fallacy. Starting from a critical psychology point of view and following the retrospective methodology, the authors interviewed 22 drug-addicted prisoners through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) regarding their biographies and their relationships with parents and partners. Design/methodology/approach: In the survey, the authors followed the same intention, and the results lend support to the idea that mother-blaming is a serious fallacy. The authors interviewed 22 drug-addicted prisoners through IPA concerning their biographies and their relationships with parents and partners. Findings: The main result of this qualitative study was the recognition of a fundamental sexism assumed by participants, characterised by a paradox between the representation of the mother and the representation of the ideal woman. Despite the mother being their positive affective referent, and battered by her husband/partner, the same participants had been witnesses of domestic violence, and sometimes victims, they interiorised from their father an ambivalent sexism: benevolent sexism with regard to their mother and exhibited hostile sexism with their partner. On the one hand, it emerged that female empowerment was desirable with respect to the mothers. On the other hand, the ideal woman was exactly as their mother was, that is, being absolutely subordinated to men (a patient, caring, submissive housewife, totally dedicated to her children and her husband). Research limitations/implications: From a mainstream psychological perspective, the limits of the research are linked to the utilisation of the narrative method. Also, this methodology does not verify any hypotheses, so quotations from the participants are used to illustrate themes, and thus, it is difficult to report the informational complexities arising from the dialogues. However, the literature has emphasised that these limitations do not invalidate qualitative research findings, despite the difficulties in generalising the results of the qualitative studies. Thereafter, the critical analysis moved within the intersection of experience-centred approaches and the culturally oriented treatment of narratives, so that the focus on the stories of the prisoners makes meaning because it applies structure to experience, albeit, with the form and content of the texts. This research did not permit us to measure and evaluate post-hoc any post-traumatic hypotheses, which, in turn, would give room for further research. Another limitation of the research was that the relationship between culture of origin and gender biases, especially with participants from non-European countries, was not analysed. This topic would require an important in-depth study, which encompasses how women are treated in different countries and its effects on social maladjustment for immigrants in Italy. Practical implications: The outcome of this study suggests that within similar structures in the Institute of Mitigated Custody, the theme of sexism should be considered in more depth. Since sexism justifies violence against women, and is therefore a factor that can cause recidivism in the antisocial behaviour of prisoners once they have served their sentences. It is important to allow them to analyse the relationship between their sexist attitudes, witnessing violence in childhood and the possibility of changing moral values of reference in favour of equality. This type of psychological intervention must necessarily be based not only on the elaboration of traumas suffered during childhood with an abusive father, but also on issues related to gender equality and the theme of social inclusion. Social implications: The study suggests the idea that male sexism can be a factor responsible for suffering and maladjustment for men and that therefore an education that promotes equality of gender differences can also help prevent the social distress associated with drug addiction and deviance. Originality/value: The paper considers some cogent issues inherent to ambivalent sexism that pervades prisoners’ aspirations for their future.",2019-09-18,Journal,Article,International Journal of Prisoner Health,4700152708,7,15,Prisoners’ ambivalent sexism and domestic violence: a narrative study,2,,10.1108/IJPH-09-2018-0046,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,648,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2019.0,51.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is suggested that, in mammals at least, wider male geographic ranges can lead to considerably increased chances of detection in fossil studies, and sexual dimorphic behavior or appearance can facilitate a considerable sex bias in fossil and modern collections, on a previously unacknowledged scale.'}",7908436,Graham Gower,6528161,Lindsey E.

Pečnerová et al., Curr. Biol. 27, 3505–3510.e3 (2017)]. Similar patterns were predicted for steppe bison, based on their analogous female herd-based structure. We genetically sexed subfossil remains of 186 Holarctic bison (Bison spp.), and also 91 brown bears (Ursus arctos), which are not female herd-based, and found that ∼75% of both groups were male, very close to the ratio observed in mammoths (72%). This large deviation from a 1:1 ratio was unexpected, but we found no evidence for sex differences with respect to DNA preservation, sample age, material type, or overall spatial distribution. We further examined ratios of male and female specimens from 4 large museum mammal collections and found a strong male bias, observable in almost all mammalian orders. We suggest that, in mammals at least, 1) wider male geographic ranges can lead to considerably increased chances of detection in fossil studies, and 2) sexual dimorphic behavior or appearance can facilitate a considerable sex bias in fossil and modern collections, on a previously unacknowledged scale.

650,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Much of the gender gap literature focuses on women’s greater average liberalism relative to men. This approach masks considerable heterogeneity in political identity and behavior among women based on race, class, and other key socio-demographic characteristics. In the 2016 Presidential contest, political divisions among women were evident in exit polling, which demonstrated that a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump. This was not an anomaly but reflects a more long-standing distinction between white women and women of other racial and ethnic identifications. In this paper, we draw on intersectionality and system justification theory as frameworks for exploring the distinctive political behavior of white women. Using data from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, we evaluate the factors that attracted white women voters to the GOP and kept them in the fold in spite of expectations that sexism in the campaign would drive women away from the party during the 2016 Presidential race. Our analyses show that many white women endorse sexist beliefs, and that these beliefs were strong determinants of their vote choice in 2016, more so than in 2012. Our findings also point to important divisions among white women based on educational attainment and household income in terms of both the endorsement of sexism and vote choice.

651,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.First impressions follow a complex process that is greatly influenced by the facial attributes and the sex of the displayer. This study aimed to evaluate whether the initial impression formed in friendship decisions is processed differently between the same-sex and opposite-sex targets in women. Twenty-four healthy female volunteers participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, in which they appraised a given face and decided whether they wanted to befriend the target. Then, a post-scan subjective rating was performed for facial components such as cheerfulness, good-looks, and uniqueness. The data were used to perform univariate whole-brain analysis to identify the neural substrates of sex bias in impression formation, and exploratory parametric modulation analysis to examine the parametric effects of facial components. Results showed that a composite of diverse areas including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior superior temporal sulcus were more engaged when viewing male faces than female faces. Parametric analysis revealed that bilateral lingual gyrus activities showed a negative parametric effect with cheerfulness for male faces, whereas left inferior parietal lobule activity showed a positive parametric effect with good-looks for female faces. During the formation of first impressions, diffuse areas related to emotion processing and conflict-monitoring were utilized when a person of the opposite sex was encountered compared to encounters with a person of the same sex. The perceived cheerfulness of a male face also showed a negative relationship with the identification of facial emotion in the male face; the more a female face was considered good-looking, a greater feeling of uneasiness appeared to be elicited.

653,"© 2019 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.Background and Aim: Many avian species are considered sexually monomorphic. In monomorphic bird species, especially in young birds, sex is difficult to identify based on an analysis of their external morphology. Accurate sex identification is essential for avian captive breeding and evolutionary studies. Methods with varying degrees of invasiveness such as vent sexing, laparoscopic surgery, steroid sexing, and chromosome inspection (karyotyping) are used for sex identification in monomorphic birds. This study aimed to assess the utility of a non-invasive molecular marker for gender identification in a variety of captive monomorphic birds, as a strategy for conservation. Materials and Methods: DNA was isolated from feather samples from 52 individuals representing 16 species of 11 families indigenous to both Indonesia and elsewhere. We amplified the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) gene using polymerase chain reaction with MP, NP, and PF primers to amplify introns with lengths that differ between the CHD-W and the CHD-Z genes, allowing sex discrimination because the W chromosome is exclusively present in females. Results: Molecular bird sexing confirmed 33 females and 19 males with 100% accuracy. We used sequencing followed by alignment on one protected bird species (Probosciger aterrimus). Conclusion: Sex identification may be accomplished noninvasively in birds, because males only have Z sex chromosomes, whereas females have both Z and W chromosomes. Consequently, the presence of a W-unique DNA sequence identifies an individual as female.

To understand these trends, it is important to consider the context in which students make decisions about which university courses to enrol in. The current study seeks to investigate gender differences in STEM through a unique approach that combines network analysis of student enrollment data with an interpretive lens based on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of courses taken by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014) to quantify Bourdieu's concept of field. We identify the fields in which physics students participate by constructing a weighted co-enrollment network and finding communities within it. We then use odds ratios to report gender differences in transverse movements between different academic fields, and non-parametric tests to assess gender differences in vertical movements (changes in students' achievement rankings within a field). Odds ratios comparing the likelihood of progression from one field to another indicate that female students were more likely to make transverse movements into life science fields. We also found that university physics did a poor job in attracting high achieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the students who did choose to study physics at university, low and middle achieving female high school students were more likely to decrease their relative rank in their first year compared to their male counterparts. Low achieving female students were also less likely to continue with physics after their first year compared to their male counterparts. Results and implications are discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory, and previous research. We argue that in order to remove constraints on female students' study choices, the field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like they belong.",2019-09-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,6,14,"Bourdieu, networks, and movements: Using the concepts of habitus, field and capital to understand a network analysis of gender differences in undergraduate physics",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0222357,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,654,Lancet Public Health,2019.0,7.0,4.0,,2146024386,Yuanyuan Wang,46919432,Zhishan Hu,15689225,K.

656,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdRationale: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent issue in refugee and internally displaced populations in post-war and migration settings including camps in the Middle East. In this context, partner violence has been associated with war-related trauma, camp factors, individual characteristics, and gender attitudes. Objective: With a dual-informant survey among a sample of Iraqi couples residing in a camp for displaced people in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (N = 92) this study investigated the relationship between war-related psychopathology, attitudes towards women, and male-perpetrated partner violence. Method: Moderated regression analysis was applied using information from both partners to predict partner violence reported by wives. Results: Over 58% of the women in this sample reported past-year exposure to partner violence. Further analyses revealed significant main effects of men's self-reported psychopathology (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression) and their own gender attitudes on partner violence. In a multivariate regression, moderating effects were found, as higher psychopathology levels and inequitable gender attitudes in men interacted in the prediction of male-perpetrated partner violence.

657,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Face perception is based on the processing and integration of multiple spatial frequency (SF) ranges. However, the temporal dynamics of SF integration to form an early face representation in the human brain is still a matter of debate. To address this issue, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during the presentation of spatial frequency-manipulated facial images. Twenty-six participants performed a gender discrimination task on non-filtered, low-, high-, and band-pass filtered face images, corresponding, respectively, to the full range, spatial frequencies up to 8 cycles/image, above 32 cycles/image, and from 8 to 16 cycles/image. Behaviorally, the task related-performance was more accurate and faster for non-filtered (NF) and mid-range SF (MSF) than for low SF (LSF) and high SF (HSF) stimuli. At both behavioral and electrophysiological levels, response to MSF contained in faces did not differ from the responses to full spectrum non-filtered (NF) facial images. In ERPs, LSF facial images evoked the largest P1 amplitude while HSF facial images evoked the largest N170 amplitude compared with the other three conditions. Since LSFs and HSFs would transmit global and local information respectively, our observations lend further support to the “coarse-to-fine” processing theory of faces. Furthermore, they offer original evidence of the effectiveness and adequacy of the mid-range spatial frequency in face perception. Possible theoretical interpretations of our findings are discussed.",2019-09-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Psychophysiology,14902,8,143,Time course of spatial frequency integration in face perception: An ERP study,1,true,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2019.07.001,Elsevier B.V.,657,Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development,2019.0,389.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""A social-justice lens is applied to political thought and participation, addressing the role of gender/sex and race/ethnicity in children's political development broadly, and in their knowledge and views of the 2016 U.S. presidential election specifically.""}",26002929,Meagan M.

658,"© 2019 Society for Research in Child DevelopmentIn this monograph, we argue for the establishment of a developmental science of politics that describes, explains, and predicts the formation and change of individuals’ political knowledge, attitudes, and behavior beginning in childhood and continuing across the life course. Reflecting our goal of contributing both theoretical conceptualizations and empirical data, we have organized the monograph into two broad sections. In the first section, we outline theoretical contributions that the study of politics may make to developmental science and provide practical reasons that empirical research in the domain of politics is important (e.g., for identifying ways to improve civics education and for encouraging higher voting rates among young adults). We also review major historical approaches to the study of political development and provide an integrative theoretical framework to ground future work. Drawing on Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems model as an organizing scheme and emphasizing social justice issues, we describe how factors rooted in cultural contexts, families, and children themselves are likely to shape political development. In the second section of the monograph, we argue for the importance and utility of studying major political events, such as presidential elections, and introduce the major themes, rationales, and hypotheses for a study of U.S. children's views of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In addition, we apply a social-justice lens to political thought and participation, addressing the role of gender/sex and race/ethnicity in children's political development broadly, and in their knowledge and views of the 2016 U.S. presidential election specifically. In interviews conducted within the month before and after the election, we examined two overarching categories of children's political attitudes: (a) knowledge, preferences, and expectations about the 2016 election, and (b) knowledge and attitudes concerning gender/sex and politics, particularly relevant for the 2016 election given Hillary Clinton's role as the first female major-party candidate for the presidency. Participants were 187 children (101 girls) between 5 and 11 years of age (M = 8.42 years, SD = 1.45 years). They were recruited from schools and youth organizations in five counties in four U.S. states (Kansas, Kentucky, Texas, and Washington) with varying voting patterns (e.g., Trump voters ranged from 27% to 71% of county voters). The sample was not a nationally representative one, but was racially diverse (35 African American, 50 Latinx, 81 White, and 21 multiracial, Asian American, Middle Eastern, or Native American children). In addition to several child characteristics (e.g., age, social dominance orientation [SDO]), we assessed several family and community characteristics (e.g., child-reported parental interest in the election and government-reported county-level voting patterns, respectively) hypothesized to predict outcome variables. Although our findings are shaped by the nature of our sample (e.g., our participants were less likely to support Trump than children in larger, nationwide samples were), they offer preliminary insights into children's political development. Overall, children in our sample were interested in and knowledgeable about the presidential election (e.g., a large majority identified the candidates correctly and reported some knowledge about their personal qualities or policy positions). They reported more information about Donald Trump's than Hillary Clinton's policies, largely accounted for by the substantial percentage of children (41%) who referred to Trump's immigration policies (e.g., building a wall between the United States and Mexico). Overall, children reported as many negative as positive personal qualities of the candidates, with negative qualities being reported more often for Trump than for Clinton (56% and 18% of children, respectively). Most children (88%) supported Clinton over Trump, a preference that did not vary by participants’ gender/sex or race/ethnicity. In their responses to an open-ended inquiry about their reactions to Trump's win, 63% of children reported negative and 18% reported positive emotions. Latinx children reacted more negatively to the election outcome than did White children. Girls’ and boys’ emotional responses to the election outcome did not differ. Children's personal interest in serving as U.S. president did not vary across gender/sex or racial/ethnic groups (overall, 42% were interested). Clinton's loss of the election did not appear to depress (or pique) girls’ interest in becoming U.S. president. With respect to the role of gender/sex in politics, many children (35%) were ignorant about women's absence from the U.S. presidency. Only a single child was able to name a historical individual who worked for women's civil rights or suffrage. Child characteristics predicted some outcome variables. For example, as expected, older children showed greater knowledge about the candidates than did younger children. Family and community characteristics also predicted some outcome variables. For example, as expected, participants were more likely to support Trump if they perceived that their parents supported him and if Trump received a greater percentage of votes in the children's county of residence. Our data suggest that civic education should be expanded and reformed. In addition to addressing societal problems requiring political solutions, civics lessons should include the histories of social groups’ political participation, including information about gender discrimination and the women's suffrage movement in U.S. political history. Providing children with environments that are rich in information related to the purpose and value of politics, and with opportunities and encouragement for political thought and action, is potentially beneficial for youth and their nations.",2019-09-01,Journal,Article,Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development,15269,25,84,Toward a Developmental Science of Politics,0,false,10.1111/mono.12410,Blackwell Publishing Inc.subscrip@blackwellpub.com,658,Developmental Dynamics,2019.0,31.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Birds harbor specific sex determination and differentiation mechanisms, and the molecular mechanisms associated with sex determination in somatic cells have been elucidated, but those for germ cells remain unclear.'}",90044500,Kennosuke Ichikawa,11785588,Ryo Ezaki,153381704,S.

Results: Here, we characterized the chicken forkhead box L3 (foxl3)-like gene as a sex-determination factor in sexually indifferent medaka germline stem cells. The foxl3-like gene was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and the nucleotide sequence was analyzed. The deduced amino acid sequence was compared with FOXL3 sequences from other species, revealing low identity and similarity scores. Expression analysis of foxl3-like mRNA during gonadogenesis showed female left-gonad-specific temporal expression in an egg incubated from 10 to 16 days, as well as low general expression in certain hatched female chicken organs. Moreover, the amino acid sequence deduced for the FOXL3-like protein displayed low identity with medaka FOXL3, with the FOXL3-like protein specifically localized in the oogonia, whereas medaka FOXL3 was found in sexually indifferent germline stem cells. Furthermore, the timing of expression differed between the foxl3-like gene and that of medaka foxl3.

The current study explored variation in the link between these three types of discrimination and health risk behaviors by focusing on how this association differed according to externalizing problem behavior status. Participants in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were asked about discrimination and their drinking, drug use and risky sexual behavior (age 15; 50% female, 82% White, n = 939). The association between discrimination and health risk behaviors varied according to both externalizing problem status and the type of discrimination, suggesting that individual-level characteristics (i.e., externalizing behaviors) shape variation in the consequences of discrimination for adolescent health outcomes.

661,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: The article aims to analyze the representativeness of women in ethnobiological publications within the Brazilian context, as well as to relate the difficulties faced by women in their scientific careers in terms of gender bias. Biases found in publications are relevant themes to different areas of knowledge, considering the historical persistence of male privilege in these activities. We analyzed the role of women in ethnobiological scientific publications and sought to reflect on gender issues in academic practices and fieldwork. Methods: We conducted a 28-year survey of academic publications in Brazil, through the Scopus and Web of Science databases, in order to infer the female representation in ethnobiological literature. We also sent 77 questionnaires to ethnobiologists associated with the Brazilian society of ethnobiology and ethnoecology or indicted by associates through snowball sampling. Results: We observed that there are more articles where the senior author is male (p < 0.05). However, there are no differences in the number of publications led by men and women (p > 0.05), which shows a positive trend in terms of representation. Within subareas, ethnozoology had more male authors than other subareas of ethnobiology. Articles whose senior authors are men tend to be published in journals with a higher impact (p < 0.05). The interviews with Brazilian ethnobiologists showed that 53.2% of the interviewees reported feeling discriminated against in the academic environment because they were women. Moreover, 61.0% said they had disadvantages in collecting data because they were women. Additionally, most of the researchers reported having witnessed cases of sexism in the studied communities. Conclusion: In the current scenarios of female participation, it is possible to reflect and identify advances and challenges associated with gender bias in ethnobiological studies conducted by Brazilian, both in the emic and etic spheres of research and in our scientific practice.

The objective of this work was the development and validation of a new analytical method to check the bioaccumulation of these toxic compounds in human organs obtained from autopsies. The contaminants were first isolated from the tissues by salt-assisted liquid-liquid extraction in acetonitrile. Because of the low concentrations of these compounds in the human body, a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure was included. The preconcentrated samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the compounds. Principal component analysis was applied to show the natural clustering of forensic samples and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis to develop a multivariate regression method, which permitted the classification of samples. The quantification limits for the 13 PAHs (acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene) analyzed were in the 0.06-0.44 ng g-1 range, depending on the compound, while the mean intraday relative standard deviation of about 7% demonstrated the high precision of the method.

666,"© 2019Testing hypotheses from the emerging Identity Pathology (IP) framework, we assessed race-gender differences in the effects of reporting experiences of racial and gender discrimination simultaneously compared with racial or gender discrimination alone, or no discrimination, on future cardiovascular health (CVH). Data were from a sample of 3758 black or white adults in CARDIA, a community-based cohort recruited in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN, and Oakland, CA in 1985–6 (year 0). Racial and gender discrimination were assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination scale. CVH was evaluated using a 12-point composite outcome modified from the Life's Simple 7, with higher scores indicating better health. Multivariable linear regressions were used to evaluate the associations between different perceptions of discrimination and CVH scores two decades later by race and gender simultaneously. Reporting racial and gender discrimination in ≥2 settings were 48% of black women, 42% of black men, 10% of white women, and 5% of white men.

These syndromes are more prevalent among women than among men, and associated with negative preconceptions that can impede rehabilitation. In two studies, we quantitatively assess how patients’ gender affects the diagnostic assessment of NFS syndromes, as well as the healthcare experiences of individuals diagnosed with NFS syndromes. In the first study, our vignette-based experiment showed that Swedish general practitioners (N = 90) were gender biased in their diagnostic assessment of NFS syndromes, such that a female patient with back pain was more likely to be assigned a NFS syndrome compared to an otherwise identical male patient.

669,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdPrior research, and high-prolife contemporary examples, show that individuals tend to underestimate their own levels of bias. This underestimation is partially explained by motivational factors. However, (meta-) cognitive factors may also be involved. Conceptualising contemporary egalitarianism as type of skill or competence, this research proposed that egalitarianism should conform to the Dunning-Kruger model. That is, individuals should overestimate their own ability, and this overestimation should be strongest in the least competent individuals. Furthermore, training should improve metacognition and reduce this overestimation. Two studies on racism (N = 148), and sexism (N = 159) partially supported these hypotheses. In line with the Dunning-Kruger model, participants overestimated their levels of racial and gender-based egalitarianism, and this pattern was strongest among the most prejudiced participants. However, diversity training did not affect participants' overestimation of their egalitarianism. Implications for contemporary prejudice, and prejudice-reducing strategies are discussed.",2019-08-01,Journal,Article,Personality and Individual Differences,12807,19,146,Prejudiced and unaware of it: Evidence for the Dunning-Kruger model in the domains of racism and sexism,2,,10.1016/j.paid.2019.03.047,Elsevier Ltd,669,Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,2019.0,26.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The purpose of this study is to explore the current practices of the first job hunt and contract negotiation for young cardiothoracic surgeons, and to identify the gaps in resources available to applicants.'}",14741274,Hélène M.

670,"© 2019 The American Association for Thoracic SurgeryObjective: Recent industry studies have projected a deficit in cardiothoracic surgeons by 2030. Little is known about the difficulties of the job search process after cardiothoracic training. The purpose of this study is to explore the current practices of the first job hunt and contract negotiation for young cardiothoracic surgeons, and to identify the gaps in resources available to applicants. Methods: In October 2017, a 56-question survey was e-mailed to recent (2013-2017) board-certified cardiothoracic surgeons in the United States inquiring about their experience securing their first cardiothoracic job. The survey was administered via REDCap, and responses were accepted over 3 months. Results: The response rate was 12.8% (61/475). The majority of cardiothoracic program graduates (86.9%) interviewed for jobs between October and March of their final cardiothoracic training year, and 79.7% of contracts were signed before completing training. Sixty-four percent of respondents negotiated their first contract. The most influential factor in job selection was partner mentorship. Average starting pretax salary for respondents was $375,588 (±$107,265). More than half of respondents reported needing more resources and support for the identification (59%) and comparison (54.1%) of job opportunities, contract negotiation (70.5%), and salary guidelines navigation (77%). Conclusions: Little guidance exists to support the search and securing of young cardiothoracic surgeons' first employment. Resources, whether institutional or organizational, are sparse and difficult to tailor to individual needs. Given the potential ramification of early career decisions, focused support is needed to remediate the lack of preparation available to the newest generations of cardiothoracic surgeons.",2019-08-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,21731,14,158,Initial report on young cardiothoracic surgeons' first job: From searching to securing and the gaps in between,1,true,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.12.104,Mosby Inc.customerservice@mosby.com,670,Journal of experimental psychology.

In the current studies, we propose that the interdependence inherent in heterosexual relationships will lead men who more strongly endorse hostile sexism to perceive they have lower power in their relationship, and that these perceptions will be biased. We also predicted that lower perceptions of power would in turn promote aggression toward intimate partners. Across 4 studies, men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism perceived lower power in their relationships. Comparisons across partners supported that these lower perceptions of power were biased; men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism underestimated the power they had compared with their partners' reports of that power (Studies 1 and 2). These lower perceptions of power, in turn, predicted greater aggression toward female partners during couples' daily interactions (Study 1), observed during couples' video-recorded conflict discussions (Study 2), and reported over the last year (Studies 3 and 4). Moreover, the associations between hostile sexism, power, and aggression were specific to men perceiving lower relationship power rather than desiring greater power in their relationships (Studies 3 and 4), and they were not the result of generally being more dominant and aggressive (Studies 3 and 4), or more negative relationship evaluations from either partner (Studies 1-4).

675,"© 2019 Salles A et al. JAMA Network Open.Importance: The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a validated tool used to measure implicit biases, which are mental associations shaped by one's environment that influence interactions with others. Direct evidence of implicit gender biases about women in medicine has yet not been reported, but existing evidence is suggestive of subtle or hidden biases that affect women in medicine. Objectives: To use data from IATs to assess (1) how health care professionals associate men and women with career and family and (2) how surgeons associate men and women with surgery and family medicine. Design, Setting, and Participants: This data review and cross-sectional study collected data from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2017, from self-identified health care professionals taking the Gender-Career IAT hosted by Project Implicit to explore bias among self-identified health care professionals. A novel Gender-Specialty IAT was also tested at a national surgical meeting in October 2017. All health care professionals who completed the Gender-Career IAT were eligible for the first analysis. Surgeons of any age, gender, title, and country of origin at the meeting were eligible to participate in the second analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Measure of implicit bias derived from reaction times on the IATs and a measure of explicit bias asked directly to participants. Results: Almost 1 million IAT records from Project Implicit were reviewed, and 131 surgeons (64.9% men; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [11.5] years) were recruited to complete the Gender-Specialty IAT. Healthcare professionals (n = 42991; 82.0% women; mean [SD] age, 32.7 [11.8] years) held implicit (mean [SD] D score, 0.41 [0.36]; Cohen d = 1.14) and explicit (mean [SD], 1.43 [1.85]; Cohen d = 0.77) biases associating men with career and women with family. Similarly, surgeons implicitly (mean [SD] D score, 0.28 [0.37]; Cohen d = 0.76) and explicitly (men: mean [SD], 1.27 [0.39]; Cohen d = 0.93; women: mean [SD], 0.73 [0.35]; Cohen d = 0.53) associated men with surgery and women with family medicine. There was broad evidence of consensus across social groups in implicit and explicit biases with one exception. Women in healthcare (mean [SD], 1.43 [1.86]; Cohen d = 0.77) and surgery (mean [SD], 0.73 [0.35]; Cohen d = 0.53) were less likely than men to explicitly associate men with career (B coefficient, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.04; P <.001) and surgery (B coefficient, -0.67; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.13; P =.001) and women with family and family medicine. Conclusions and Relevance: The main contribution of this work is an estimate of the extent of implicit gender bias within surgery. On both the Gender-Career IAT and the novel Gender-Specialty IAT, respondents had a tendency to associate men with career and surgery and women with family and family medicine.

In rheumatoid arthritis research, this has led to the discovery of important candidate genes which offered novel insights into mechanisms and their possible roles in the cure of the disease. In the last years, data generation has outstripped data analysis and while many studies focused on specific aspects of the disease, a global picture of the disease is not yet accomplished. Here, we analyzed and compared a collection of gene expression information from healthy individuals and from patients suffering under different arthritis conditions from published studies containing the following clinical conditions: early and established rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and arthralgia. We show comprehensive overviews of this data collection and give new insights specifically on gene expression in the early stage, into sex-dependent gene expression, and we describe general differences in expression of different biotypes of genes. Many genes that are related to cytoskeleton changes (actin filament related genes) are differently expressed in early rheumatoid arthritis in comparison to healthy subjects; interestingly, eight of these genes reverse their expression ratio significantly between men and women compared early rheumatoid arthritis and healthy subjects. There are some slighter changes between men and woman between the conditions early and established rheumatoid arthritis. Another aspect are miRNAs and other gene biotypes which are not only promising candidates for diagnoses but also change their expression grossly in average at rheumatoid arthritis and arthralgia compared to the healthy condition.

680,"© 2019 Society for the Study of AddictionBackground and Aims: Identifying typologies of social determinants of health (SDoH) vulnerability influencing drug use practices among women living with HIV (WLWH) can help to address associated harms. This research aimed to explore the association of SDoH clusters with drug use among WLWH. Design: Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify the distinct clusters of SDoH. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was employed to account for confounding and potential selection bias. Associations were analyzed using generalized linear model with log link and Poisson distribution, and then weighted risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Setting and Participants: Data from 1422 WLWH recruited at time-point 1 of the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS, 2013–15), with 1252 participants at 18 months follow-up (time-point 2). Measurements: Drug use was defined as use of illicit/non-prescribed opioids/stimulants in the past 6 months. SDoH indicators included: race discrimination, gender discrimination, HIV stigma, social support, access to care, food security, income level, employment status, education, housing status and histories of recent sex work and incarceration. Findings: LCA identified four SDoH classes: no/least SDoH adversities (6.6%), discrimination/stigma (17.7%), economic hardship (30.8%) and most SDoH adversities (45.0%).

685,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.The 'manosphere' has been a recent subject of feminist scholarship on the web. Serious accusations have been levied against it for its role in encouraging misogyny and violent threats towards women online, as well as for potentially radicalising lonely or disenfranchised men. Feminist scholars evidence this through a shift in the language and interests of some men's rights activists on the manosphere, away from traditional subjects of family law or mental health and towards more sexually explicit, violent, racist and homophobic language. In this paper, we study this phenomenon by investigating the flow of extreme language across seven online communities on Reddit, with openly misogynistic members (e.g., Men Going Their Own Way, Involuntarily Celibates), and investigate if and how misogynistic ideas spread within and across these communities. Grounded on feminist critiques of language, we created nine lexicons capturing specific misogynistic rhetoric (Physical Violence, Sexual Violence, Hostility, Patriarchy, Stoicism, Racism, Homophobia, Belittling, and Flipped Narrative) and used these lexicons to explore how language evolves within and across misogynistic groups. This analysis was conducted on 6 million posts, from 300K conversations created between 2011 and December 2018.

686,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.On November 8, 2016 Donald Trump, a man with no office-holding experience, won the Electoral College, defeating the first woman to receive the presidential nomination from a major party. This paper offers the first observational test of how sexism affects presidential vote choice in the general election, adding to the rich literature on gender and candidate success for lower-level offices. We argue that the 2016 election implicated gender through Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and Donald Trump’s sexist rhetoric, and activated gender attitudes such that sexism is associated with vote choice. Using an Election Day exit poll survey of over 1300 voters conducted at 12 precincts in a mid-size city and a national survey of over 10,000 White and Black Americans, we find that a politically defined measure of sexism—the belief that men are better suited emotionally for politics than women—predicts support for Trump both in terms of vote choice and favorability. We find the effect is strongest and most consistent among White voters. However, a domestically defined measure of sexism—whether men should be in control of their wives—offers little explanatory power over the vote. In total, our results demonstrate the importance of gender in the 2016 election, beyond mere demographic differences in vote choice: beliefs about gender and fitness for office shape both White men and women’s preferences.",2019-06-15,Journal,Article,Political Behavior,22832,48,41,"Is Sexism for White People?

However, indicators of the disease are not equally distributed between women. Poverty and low levels of schooling associate with late diagnosis, worse prognosis and lower survival. Objective: To investigate differences between women from different socio-demographic profiles in the breast cancer care trajectory in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Method: This is a hermeneutic study through narrative analysis. The selection of the participants was based on data from hospital records of four public and private oncology services in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, according to the following variables: Age, levels of schooling, and treatment cost source (Proxy of income): In-depth interviews were performed with 35 women characterized in three profiles: Profile 1 (n = 7), age range 51-69 years, schooling ≥15 years and private treatment cost; Profile 2 (n = 13), age range 35-58 years, schooling = 11 years and predominantly public treatment costing; Profile 3 (n = 15), age range 43-79 years, schooling ≤ 8 years and public treatment cost. Results: The analysis of the narratives allowed the identification of three main themes (preventive care and first signs/symptoms; search for care and diagnosis of cancer; treatment and perceptions about care received) that highlighted differences between the trajectories, with prejudice to women with characteristics of greater vulnerability (Profile 3).

688,"© 2019 Intellect Ltd Article. English language.Allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, co-owner of US entertainment company Miramax Films, which led to the revitalized #MeToo movement of October 2017, gave global recognition to the sexual violence (sexism, misogyny, sexual harassment, assault and rape) that women experience in the creative industries. As a spin-off, the #MeNoMore campaign in December 2017 resulted in more than 400 women working in the Australian music industry speaking out against similar behavior. Despite having a reputation for sexual violence, the local music press played a minor role in this hashtag development, claiming that its practices are tied to radical, liberal and progressive values. In the post-Weinstein, #MeToo and #MeNoMore era, this contradiction signifies that the Australian music press is fertile ground for a feminist investigation. However, to date minimal local research has examined the link between sexual violence and music journalism. As a literature review to a larger empirical case study, this article draws on a critical discourse analysis from the post-feminist wave of media research into rockism, poptimism, punk, rap, hip hop, dubstep and electronic dance music genres, mainly conducted in the United States and United Kingdom.

691,"© 2018 American Psychological Association.Exposure to sexual objectification is an everyday experience for many women, yet little is known about its emotional consequences. Fredrickson and Roberts' (1997) objectification theory proposed a withinperson process, wherein exposure to sexual objectification causes women to adopt a third-person perspective on their bodies, labeled self-objectification, which has harmful downstream consequences for their emotional well-being. However, previous studies have only tested this model at the between-person level, making them unreliable sources of inference about the proposed intraindividual psychological consequences of objectification. Here, we report the results of Bayesian multilevel structural equation models that simultaneously tested Fredrickson and Roberts' (1997) predictions both within and between persons, using data from 3 ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies of women's (N = 268) experiences of sexual objectification in daily life. Our findings support the predicted within-person indirect effect of exposure to sexual objectification on increases in negative and self-conscious emotions via self-objectification.

We investigated whether women’s experiences of sexual harassment and STEM-related gender bias negatively predicted their STEM motivation (task value, competence beliefs, and perceived costs) and STEM career aspirations. We also tested whether STEM encouragement from friends and family positively predicted motivation and aspirations. To consider domain-specific effects, we also tested the predictors in relation to non-STEM motivation and career aspirations. Students’ grade point average was controlled in all analyses. The sample was undergraduate women enrolled in gateway biology courses for majors (N = 685; M = 19.67 years of age; 35% Asian, 31% White, and 27% Latinx). A majority experienced gender bias (60.9%) or sexual harassment (78.1%) at least once in the past year. STEM-related gender bias from classmates and sexual harassment from instructors (faculty, teaching assistants, or graduate students) were negatively related to STEM motivation and career aspirations. Perceived STEM encouragement from friends was positively related to motivation, and STEM encouragement from friends and family predicted STEM career aspirations.

693,"© 2018 American Psychological Association.We introduce and investigate the philosophical concept of 'speciesism' - the assignment of different moral worth based on species membership - as a psychological construct. In five studies, using both general population samples online and student samples, we show that speciesism is a measurable, stable construct with high interpersonal differences, that goes along with a cluster of other forms of prejudice, and is able to predict real-world decision-making and behavior. In Study 1 we present the development and empirical validation of a theoretically driven Speciesism Scale, which captures individual differences in speciesist attitudes. In Study 2, we show high test-retest reliability of the scale over a period of four weeks, suggesting that speciesism is stable over time. In Study 3, we present positive correlations between speciesism and prejudicial attitudes such as racism, sexism, homophobia, along with ideological constructs associated with prejudice such as social dominance orientation, system justification, and right-wing authoritarianism. These results suggest that similar mechanisms might underlie both speciesism and other well-researched forms of prejudice. Finally, in Studies 4 and 5, we demonstrate that speciesism is able to predict prosociality towards animals (both in the context of charitable donations and time investment) and behavioral food choices above and beyond existing related constructs.

The results show that that there is, even when controlling for the number of women in parliament, electoral system, gender quotas, level of human development, level of women’s rights, freedom from corruption, and media access, a significant relationship between media sexism—measured as (i) the share of all news subjects that are women and (ii) the share of all news subjects portrayed in the function of experts who are women—and the share of women candidates for parliament: the higher the level of media sexism, the lower the share of women candidates.

696,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdImpact force induced in sideways falls is an important determinant of hip fracture risk. While body parameters may differently affect the magnitude of impact force in men and women, the effect of sex is not considered in existing impact force predictors. The objective of this study was to construct a female-specific equation to predict the fall-induced impact force applied to the hip and evaluate whether it could improve hip facture risk assessment. A previously developed human-body dynamic model was used to simulate falling of 80 women and determine the hip impact force. Results were then used to derive a female-specific equation between impact force and body parameters. The proposed female-specific equation and available non-sex-specific impact force predictors in the literature were integrated with a finite element model to discriminate hip fracture patients among 393 women (99 hip fractures; 294 non-fracture controls). Results of the implemented methods were compared to evaluate whether considering the effect of sex could improve the discrimination of females with and without a hip fracture. The area under the curve (AUC)and odds ratio (OR)for the assessed hip fracture risk by the proposed female-specific method (AUC = 0.799, OR = 4.22)were significantly (p<0.001)greater than those of non-sex-specific methods (the most accurate: AUC =0.750, OR =3.62).

We continue to examine the lending practices to same-sex borrowers and its spillover effects. The persistent results since 1990 reveal that, in contrast with otherwise comparable different-sex loan applicants, the approval rate for same-sex applicants is ∼3–8% lower. Furthermore, conditional on approval, lenders, on average, charge about 0.02–0.2% higher interest to same-sex borrowers, which is equivalent to an annual total of $8.6 million to $86 million in additional interest/fees nationwide. Meanwhile, we find that same-sex borrowers are less risky overall, as they exhibit similar default risk but lower prepayment risk. Finally, we document findings of spillover effects. That is, when the share of a neighborhood’s same-sex population increases, both same-sex and different-sex borrowers seem to experience more unfavorable lending outcomes overall.

700,"© 2019 JAMA Network Open.All right reserved.IMPORTANCE Women are underrepresented at higher ranks in academic medicine. However, the factors contributing to this disparity have not been fully elucidated. Implicit bias and unconscious mental attitudes toward a person or group may be factors. Although academic medical centers use physician trainee evaluations of faculty to inform promotion decisions, little is known about gender bias in these evaluations. To date, no studies have examined narrative evaluations of medical faculty by physician trainees for differences based on gender. OBJECTIVE To characterize gender-associated linguistic differences in narrative evaluations of medical faculty written by physician trainees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included all faculty teaching evaluations completed for the department of medicine faculty by medical students, residents, and fellows at a large academic center in Pennsylvania from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2018, through July 31, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Word use in faculty evaluations was quantified using automated text mining by converting free-text comments into unique 1- and 2-word phrases. Mixedeffects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations of faculty gender with frequencies of specific words and phrases present in a physician trainee evaluation. RESULTS A total of 7326 unique evaluations were collected for 521 faculty (325 men [62.4%] and 196 women [37.6%]). The individual words art (odds ratio [OR], 7.78; 95%CI, 1.01-59.89), trials (OR, 4.43; 95%CI, 1.34-14.69), master (OR, 4.24; 95%CI, 1.69-10.63), and humor (OR, 2.32; 95%CI, 1.44-3.73) were significantly associated with evaluations of male faculty, whereas the words empathetic (OR, 4.34; 95%CI, 1.56-12.07), delight (OR, 4.26; 95%CI, 1.35-13.40), and warm (OR, 3.45; 95%CI, 1.83-6.49) were significantly associated with evaluations of female faculty. Two-word phrases associated with male faculty evaluations included run rounds (OR, 7.78; 95%CI, 1.01-59.84), big picture (OR, 7.15; 95%CI, 1.68-30.42), and master clinician (OR, 4.02; 95%CI, 1.21-13.36), whereas evaluations of female faculty were more likely to be associated with model physician (OR, 7.75; 95% CI, 1.70-35.39), just right (OR, 6.97; 95%CI, 1.51-32.30), and attention (to) detail (OR, 4.26; 95%CI, 1.36-13.40).

Methods Data were from 304 LGB men and women aged 41–85 years participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Perceived discrimination in daily life was reported in 2010/11. Participants could attribute their discrimination experience to characteristics including age, sex, race, physical disability, and sexual orientation. Self-rated health, limiting long-standing illness, depressive symptoms, quality of life, life satisfaction and loneliness were assessed in 2010/11 and 2016/17. Analyses adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, partnership status and socioeconomic position. Results Perceived discrimination in daily life was reported by 144 (47.4%) participants. Cross-sectionally, perceived discrimination in daily life was associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.02 to 5.21), loneliness (OR = 3.37, 95% CI 1.60 to 7.10) and lower quality of life (B = -3.31, 95% CI -5.49 to -1.12). Prospectively, perceived discrimination in daily life was associated with increased odds of loneliness (OR = 3.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 8.99) and lower quality of life (B = -2.08, 95% CI -3.85 to -0.31) and life satisfaction (B = -1.92, 95% CI -3.44 to -0.39) over six-year follow-up. Effect sizes were consistently larger for participants who attributed experiences of discrimination to their sexual orientation compared with those who attributed experiences of discrimination to other reasons (e.g. age, sex, race).

703,"© 2018 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsObjective: To examine the relationship between gender and a career in academic medicine. Design: Mixed-methods study. Setting: Obstetrics–gynaecology postgraduate training programme in Paris, France. Sample: Postgraduate trainees in obstetrics–gynaecology (n = 204). Methods: Statistical analysis of quantitative survey data, thematic analysis of qualitative interview data and integrative analysis. Main outcome measures: Women's aspirations and obstacles related to their decision about a career in academic medicine. Results: A career in academic medicine was envisaged by 13% of the women residents and 27% of the men (P = 0.01). Women reported receiving advice from a mentor less often than men (38.8% versus 52.9%, P = 0.002). Overall, 40.6% of women and 2.9% of men reported experiencing gender discrimination (P < 0.001). In response to the question ‘Do you have doubts about your ability to pursue or succeed at an academic career?’, 62.4% of the women and only 17.7% of the men answered yes (P < 0.001). The global analysis identified the following obstacles: persistent gender stereotypes that produce everyday sexism, lack of identification with male role models, lack of mentors, perceived discrimination, an ideal of professional excellence that is difficult to attain, constraining professional organisational norms, inequality between men and women in the domestic and family spheres, and finally self-censorship and important doubts about their ability to combine a demanding career and a fulfilling personal life. Conclusions: Women reported the desire to follow a career in academic medicine half as often as men.

Among adults, racial and gender biases intersect: negative racial biases are expressed more strongly against males than females. Here, we consider the developmental origin of bias at the intersection of race and gender. Relying on both implicit and explicit measures, we assessed 4-year-old children's responses to target images of children who varied systematically in both race (Black and White) and gender (male and female). Children revealed a strong and consistent pro-White bias. This racial bias was expressed more strongly for males than females: children's responses to Black boys were less positive than to Black girls, White boys or White girls.

707,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.Five studies illuminate how the demands of the roles that people occupy can sometimes contribute to the maintenance of group inequality by promoting the accommodation of others’ biases, even when those biases disadvantage an in-group or clash with personal views. When role demands to maximize candidate fit in hiring selections were strong, preference for job candidates of a given group tended to be lower when there were cues to third-party prejudice against that group (vs. no cues), irrespective of in-group favoritism effects (Studies 1–5) or participant attitudes (Studies 4 and 5). We found supporting evidence for the underlying processes in the context of hiring selections involving fictional groups (Study 1) as well as female job candidates (Studies 2–5). A concern with meeting the demands of the gatekeeper role was at the root of prejudice accommodation: When role-demands to prioritize candidate fit were strong, role-relevant considerations (interpersonal and task-focused) mediated the accommodation effect (Studies 1 and 4). The more gatekeepers in charge of hiring sought to meet role demands by considering the preferences of relevant third parties, the more they accommodated third-party prejudice (Study 2). Moreover, role-based concerns mediated the accommodation of prejudice—but not other potential considerations that were unrelated to role demands (Study 3). Finally, the accommodation effect was eliminated when the role definition did not prioritize candidate fit (Study 4) and when we experimentally reduced the strength of role-related concerns (Study 5). These findings illustrate the relevance of the role concept for understanding the social transmission of bias.",2019-05-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,15499,2,82,Channeling others’ biases to meet role demands,0,false,10.1016/j.jesp.2019.01.004,Academic Press Inc.apjcs@harcourt.com,707,Affilia,2018.0,68.0,0.0,,50822217,S.

709,"© 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2019.Gender disparity in academic medicine has been well described in the civilian sector. This has not yet been evaluated in the military health system where hundreds of female surgeons are practicing. Military service limits factors such as part time work and control over time spent away from family, which are often cited as contributors to the pay and promotion gap in civilian academic medicine. The military has explicit policies to limit discrimination based on gender. Pay between men and women is equal as it is based on rank and time in rank. One would expect to see less disparity in promotion through the academic ranks for military female surgeons given this otherwise equal treatment. This has not previously been objectively tracked or reported. It is beneficial to characterize the military academic medicine gender gap and benchmark against national data to define the academic gender gap and lay the groundwork for future work to identify factors contributing to the observed difference. Material and Methods: This study was granted exemption from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) Internal Review Board (IRB). The Uniformed Services University (USU) Department of Surgery academic appointment list was reviewed to assess female representation in the categories of Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Other. Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and the US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) were assessed for total numbers of female surgeons on active duty, and numbers were compared with nationally published Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) data using a logistic regression model. Results: There was a higher proportion of women in academic positions in the civilian cohort than in the military cohort (OR: 1.84; CI: 1.53-2.21, p <. 0001). This difference was observed at every level of academic achievement. A higher percentage of women were observed at lower levels of professorship than at higher levels; instructors were more likely to be women than assistant professor (OR: 1.44, CI:1.16-1.79), associate professor (OR: 2.24, CI: 1.77-2.84), or full professor (OR:4.61, CI: 3.57-5.94). Conclusions: Fewer female surgeons in military medicine hold academic appointment when compared with their counterparts in civilian medicine. Similar to the civilian sector, military academic surgery also demonstrates less likelihood of female representation in higher academic stations. This discrepancy in representation follows a linear trend over the different ranks. This discrepancy has not been previously documented. The military offers a unique opportunity to study the issue of gender imbalance in academic promotion practices given its otherwise equal treatment of males and females. Additional studies will be necessary to understand uniformed female surgeons' barriers to academic advancement.",2019-04-02,Journal,Article,Military Medicine,19054,6,184,Military Medicine and the Academic Surgery Gender Gap,1,true,10.1093/milmed/usz083,Oxford University Press,709,Annual Review of Public Health,2019.0,202.0,7.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Guided by the ecosocial theory of disease distribution, key features of the specified ""isms"" are synthesized and a measurement schema is provided, informed by research from both the Global North and the Global South.'}",144810681,N.

711,"© 2019, Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology. All rights reserved.Every law is enacted with a purpose and that purpose can be find out from the preamble of the Act. Even the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994 was enacted with a purpose to control the female feticide. The preamble of the Act states that “An Act to provide for the prohibition of sex selection, before or after conception, and for regulation of prenatal diagnostic techniques for the purposes of detecting genetic abnormalities or metabolic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities or certain congenital malformations or sex-linked disorders and for the prevention of their misuse for sex determination leading to female feticide; and, for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto”. Thus from here it is clear that this act can be used only for the detection of any kind of abnormalities in fetus but not for sex detection which may result in female feticide. Female feticide or sex selective abortion is the practice of elimination of the female fetus in the womb itself but before this the sex of the fetus has to be determined and it can be done by methods like amniocentesis, chorion villus biopsy, ultra-sonography. Once the sex of the fetus is determined, then it is aborted if it is found to be unwanted sex. This Act was introduced to control the female feticide basically, but if go by the history of the abortion law in India, there we will find that MTP Act was introduced as a family planning method to control the population. It was later when due to female feticide issue and skewed sex ratio; Government enacted PCPNDT Act to control the skewed sex ratio by controlling the female feticide.

To summarize the state of the art for clinicians and researchers. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies with a control group (usual care or enhanced usual care) conducted in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries and published until 2016. Results: Thirty-one interventions were identified, the majority of which were conducted in the United States in patients with breast cancer. Most interventions aimed to decrease social inequalities based on ethnicity/race and/or socioeconomic level, with fewer interventions targeting inequalities based on geographical area. The most frequently assessed outcomes were quality of life (n = 20) and psychosocial factors (n = 20), followed by treatment adherence or satisfaction (n = 12,), knowledge (n = 11), pain management (n = 10), and lifestyle habits (n = 3). Conclusions: The impact of interventions designed to improve cancer treatment and follow-up care in socially disadvantages groups is multifactorial. Multicomponent-intervention approaches and cultural adaptations are common, and their effectiveness should be evaluated in the populations of interest. More interventions are needed from outside the Unite States and in patients with cancers other than breast cancer, targeting gender or geographical inequalities and addressing key outcomes such as treatment adherence or symptom management.",2019-04-01,Journal,Review,Psycho-Oncology,13069,6,28,Effectiveness of interventions to improve cancer treatment and follow-up care in socially disadvantaged groups,1,true,10.1002/pon.5011,"John Wiley and Sons LtdSouthern GateChichester, West SussexPO19 8SQvgorayska@wiley.com",713,Human Brain Mapping,2018.0,95.0,4.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The reliability of sex differences confirms the importance of sex as a moderator of individual differences in brain structure and suggests future research should consider sex specific models.'}",3410867,N.

714,"© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Differences between males and females have been extensively documented in biological, psychological, and behavioral domains. Among these, sex differences in the rate and typology of antisocial behavior remains one of the most conspicuous and enduring patterns among humans. However, the nature and extent of sexual dimorphism in the brain among antisocial populations remains mostly unexplored. Here, we seek to understand sex differences in brain structure between incarcerated males and females in a large sample (n = 1,300) using machine learning. We apply source-based morphometry, a contemporary multivariate approach for quantifying gray matter measured with magnetic resonance imaging, and carry these parcellations forward using machine learning to classify sex. Models using components of brain gray matter volume and concentration were able to differentiate between males and females with greater than 93% generalizable accuracy. Highly differentiated components include orbitofrontal and frontopolar regions, proportionally larger in females, and anterior medial temporal regions proportionally larger in males. We also provide a complimentary analysis of a nonforensic healthy control sample and replicate our 93% sex discrimination. These findings demonstrate that the brains of males and females are highly distinguishable. Understanding sex differences in the brain has implications for elucidating variability in the incidence and progression of disease, psychopathology, and differences in psychological traits and behavior. The reliability of these differences confirms the importance of sex as a moderator of individual differences in brain structure and suggests future research should consider sex specific models.",2019-04-01,Journal,Article,Human Brain Mapping,16101,26,40,Machine learning of brain gray matter differentiates sex in a large forensic sample,1,true,10.1002/hbm.24462,John Wiley and Sons Inc.P.O.Box 18667NewarkNJ 07191-8667,714,Injury Prevention,2017.0,43.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is recommended that future child safety campaigns represent changing family dynamics, include representations of children with non-traditionally gendered sporting equipment, and avoid the representation of gender as binary.'}",26321031,M.

A critical discourse analysis of gender bias in child safety campaign marketing materials can offer important insights into how families are represented and the potential influence that gender bias may have on uptake of injury prevention information. Methods Our approach was informed by poststructural feminist theory, and we used critical discourse analysis to identify discourses within the poster materials. We examined the national Safe Kids Canada Safe Kids Week campaign poster material spanning twenty years (1997-2016). Specifically, we analyzed the posters' typeface, colour, images, and language to identify gender bias in relation to discourses surrounding parenting, safety, and societal perceptions of gender. Results The findings show that there is gender bias present in the Safe Kids Week poster material. The posters represent gender as binary, mothers as primary caregivers, and showcase stereotypically masculine sporting equipment among boys and stereotypically feminine equipment among girls. Interestingly, we found that the colour and typeface of the text both challenge and perpetuate the feminization of safety. Discussion It is recommended that future child safety campaigns represent changing family dynamics, include representations of children with non-traditionally gendered sporting equipment, and avoid the representation of gender as binary. This analysis contributes to the discussion of the feminization of safety in injury prevention research and challenges the ways in which gender is represented in child safety campaigns.",2019-04-01,Journal,Article,Injury Prevention,15054,3,25,"Safe kids week: Analysis of gender bias in a national child safety campaign, 1997-2016",0,false,10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042442,BMJ Publishing Groupsubscriptions@bmjgroup.com,715,,2019.0,15.0,0.0,,35821200,S.

In contrast, we predicted that a Donald Trump victory would decrease perceived gender equality. Pre- and postelection data revealed that perceived gender equality indeed decreased immediately after Election Day, but only for those who preferred Clinton over Trump—thus increasing polarization between Trump and Clinton supporters on gender-related issues. In an experimental study using a fictitious election, we found that both the winner’s gender and sexism of the man candidate contributed, independently, to perceived gender inequality.

After encountering a confrontable moment, would-be confronters can head directly into a confrontation and approach the ultimate destination of reducing others' bias. Or, confronters may make a ""pit stop"" to take advantage of strategies that may help them to preserve positive impressions of themselves in others' eyes.

In the face of these injustices, some women and men decide to confront sexist events, whereas others do not. In this chapter, we focus on the factors that motivate people to confront sexism with particular attention to the ways in which confrontations of sexism might be unique. We first consider the integral role of recognizing sexism in predicting confronting behaviors. Viewed through the lens of Ambivalent Sexism Theory, we articulate the ways in which sexism, in contrast to other forms of bias, may be particularly difficult to recognize. Next, we present research findings regarding the diversity of sexist experiences and the role of social power differentials in predicting confronting. We also detail how both perceived and actual costs and benefits of confronting sexism motivate women to confront. We pay special attention to ally confrontation and the differential effectiveness of ally versus target confrontation, with speculation as to how male allies may both help and hinder the goal to reduce sexism.

725,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Negative consequences of video games have been a concern since their inception. However, one under-researched area is the potential negative effects of sexualized video game content on players. This study analyzed the consequences of sexualized video game content on online sexual harassment against male and female targets. We controlled for a number of variables that might be related to online sexual harassment (i.e., trait aggressiveness, ambivalent sexism, online disinhibition). Participants (N = 211) played a video game with either sexualized or non-sexualized female characters. After gameplay, they had the opportunity to sexually harass a male or a female partner by sending them sexist jokes. Based on the General Aggression Model integrated with the Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression (Anderson & Anderson,), we predicted that playing the game with sexualized female characters would increase sexual harassment against female targets. Results were consistent with these predictions. Sexual harassment levels toward a female partner were higher for participants who played the game with sexualized female characters than for participants who played the same game with non-sexualized female characters. These findings indicate that sexualization of female characters in a video game can be a sufficient condition to provoke online sexual harassment toward women.",2019-03-01,Journal,Article,Aggressive Behavior,29452,14,45,Effects of sexualized video games on online sexual harassment,2,,10.1002/ab.21811,Wiley-Liss Inc.info@wiley.com,725,Psychology of women quarterly,2019.0,76.0,0.0,,113835892,Rachel A.

726,"© The Author(s) 2018. Researchers have shown that prejudice encourages explanations for inequality that attribute stigmatized groups’ negative outcomes to internal-controllable causes. We extended this research by investigating how ambivalent sexism affects attributions for gender income inequality. Hostile sexism should facilitate acceptance of gender income inequality through attributions that emphasize individual choice. We tested this hypothesis in two web-based samples of predominately White American men and women, ranging in age from 18 to 82 years (M age = 33.8). In Study 1 (N = 650), hostile sexism, but not benevolent sexism, positively predicted acceptance of gender income inequality. Attributions of choice and societal unfairness mediated this effect. In Study 2 (N = 242), following exposure to hostile sexism, participants increased acceptance of gender income inequality; choice explanations mediated this relation, although these effects occurred for political conservatives only. Consistent with prior work on attributions, hostile sexism was linked to victim-blaming attributions for gender income inequality. Overall, hostile sexism creates an attitudinal barrier—especially for conservatives—to supporting equal pay for women. To overcome this barrier, organizations could implement strategies aimed at ensuring more objective performance evaluations and pay decisions. Further, policy makers and communicators should be careful in choosing how they frame the gender pay gap.

Hierarchical regression analyses on data collected in three countries (i.e., two heterogeneous adult samples from Turkey and the Netherlands, and two student samples from Belgium; combined N = 964) revealed that although individual differences in religiosity did predict traditional gender role beliefs and sexism (towards both women and men), its impact was limited compared to the impact of individual differences in social-ideological attitudes (i.e., social dominance orientation and particularly authoritarianism).

728,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Many people hold negative stereotypes about feminists. Verbally, feminist women are often described in masculine terms whereas feminist men tend to be described in feminine terms. Here, we demonstrate that these effects extend to a fundamental perceptual level, more specifically, to the domain of face perception even in Norway, the most gender-egalitarian country of the world. Four studies were conducted using a data-driven reverse-correlation technique to test how feminist women and men are visually represented. In Studies 1 (n = 123) and 2 (n = 61), Norwegians had more masculine-looking and less feminine-looking visual representations of feminist women as compared to women with moderate gender-related beliefs or other activist identities (i.e., the control conditions). These effects, which were particularly pronounced among male participants and those with stronger hostile sexist beliefs, further explained why feminist women were perceived as threatening. In Studies 3 (n = 131) and 4 (n = 74), participants had a less masculine-looking visual representation of feminist men as compared to the control condition. This effect was especially pronounced among female participants. In addition, effects were again moderated by hostile sexism, such that participants with stronger hostile sexist beliefs visualized the feminist man as less masculine than the man in the control condition. In sum, the results suggest that people have asymmetrically gendered visual representations of feminist women and men. Feminist women are visually represented as more masculine whereas the opposite is true for feminist men. We discuss our findings in light of women’s and men’s reluctance to identify as feminists and suggest potential interventions to change biased visual representations of feminists.",2019-03-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,12,80,Feminist ≠ Feminine?

There is increasing evidence to suggest that all aspects of employment, from hiring to performance evaluation to promotion, are affected by gender and cultural background. In higher education, bias in performance evaluation has been posited as one of the reasons why few women make it to the upper echelons of the academic hierarchy. With unprecedented access to institution-wide student survey data from a large public university in Australia, we investigated the role of conscious or unconscious bias in terms of gender and cultural background. We found potential bias against women and teachers with non-English speaking backgrounds. Our findings suggest that bias may decrease with better representation of minority groups in the university workforce.

731,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Flesh flies are insects of forensic importance as the larvae associated with human remains can be used to estimate a minimum post-mortem interval (PMI min ) in most cases. And, because life-history traits can vary across species, correct identification is a mandatory step before being used as evidence. Adult flesh flies are extremely similar in general appearance, which causes difficulty in species identification as it is largely based on the morphology of the male genitalia; this also makes it difficult to identify females. Currently, landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis of insect wings has proven to be a valuable tool for species identification. Herein, we applied wing morphometric analysis of 524 flesh fly specimens comprising 12 species from Thailand. The right wing of each specimen was removed, mounted on a microscope slide, photographed, and digitized using 18 landmarks. Wing shape variation among genera and species were analyzed using canonical variate analysis, while wing shape variation between sexes of each species was analyzed using discriminant function analysis. A cross-validation test was used to evaluate the reliability of classification. Results of this study demonstrate wing shape can be used to separate genera and species, and distinguish between sexes of the same species, with high reliability.

735,"© 2019 The Author(s).Natural aggressiveness is commonly observed in all animal species, and is displayed frequently when animals compete for food, territory and mating. Aggression is an innate behaviour, and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. However, the genetics of aggression remains largely unclear. In this study, we identify the peacefulness (pfs) gene as a novel player in the control of male-male aggression in Drosophila. Mutations in pfs decreased intermale aggressiveness, but did not affect locomotor activity, olfactory avoidance response and sexual behaviours. pfs encodes for the evolutionarily conserved molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis 1 protein (Mocs1), which catalyzes the first step in the MoCo biosynthesis pathway. Neuronal-specific knockdown of pfs decreased aggressiveness. By contrast, overexpression of pfs greatly increased aggressiveness. Knocking down Cinnamon (Cin) catalyzing the final step in the MoCo synthesis pathway, caused a pfs-like aggression phenotype. In humans, inhibition of MoCo-dependent enzymes displays anti-aggressive effects.

Yet, despite the representation of both implicit and explicit forms of domestic abuse and sexual violence throughout Breaking Bad (2008–2013), there is an apparent disconnect between how this behaviour is perceived on screen and how it is ostensibly regarded in society. It is here, at the intersection of audience reception and sociological theory that I argue Breaking Bad represents abuse as part of a broader negotiation of masculinity, one that contributes to the ongoing marginalization of women’s voices in both visual media narratives and, by extension, society. In particular, I argue that despite the series’ long-form structure, the lack of emphasis placed on instances of coercive control by the writers and directors is partly responsible for contributing towards a culture of misogyny and victim-blaming fostered by fans towards Skyler evident in numerous online blog posts, fan forums, social media platforms, and Anna Gunn’s own treatise on the portrayal of her character in the New York Times.",2019-01-02,Journal,Article,Feminist Media Studies,5700168400,13,19,Sexual violence in serial form: Breaking Bad habits on TV,0,false,10.1080/14680777.2017.1396484,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,736,,2019.0,24.0,0.0,,115599250,Tupur Chatterjee,,,,,,,,,,,29.0,33.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology

Specifically, I identify how the December 16 “trigger event” and Delhi’s notorious misogyny are finding newer modes of representation through the interplay of genre and exhibition space.

New engagements with the figure of the consuming middle-class woman and the public discourses that surround her sexual safety and navigation of space have taken a central position in understanding the present urban psychosis of the capital.

Women from two different samples (MTurk and university) were randomly assigned to recall a high-versus low-power experience, view real-world events of sexism, and then complete questionnaires assessing endorsement of social media activism, positive affect, and collective action intentions. A dual moderated mediation analyses at the second stage of mediation showed equivalency across two samples, at which point the single moderated mediation model was tested on the combined sample. The model was significant, such that among those in the high-power condition, endorsing social media activism was associated with greater positive affect, which in turn predicted greater collective action intentions.

There were almost no responses describing complexity of the modern sexism, which the theories of system justification and ambivalent sexism highlight.

Objectives: To analyze data using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify groups of individuals with specific patterns of discrimination based on sexual orientation (DSO). Methods: Cross-sectional study using respondent-driven sampling in 12 Brazilian cities in 2016. LCA was used to characterize discrimination among MSM based on 13 variables in the survey questionnaire. The proportions of men reporting DSO and other variables of interest were estimated using Gile’s Successive Sampling estimator. Results: Most MSM were young, single, had a religion, had a high school or college degree, black or brown skin color, and socioeconomic status classified as average. More than half of the participants reported that they had been discriminated against during the last 12 months due to their sexual orientation (65%), more than a third said they had felt afraid of walking in public places during the past 12 months, and about one-fifth of participants reported having been victims of physical or sexual assault due to DSO. DSO was classified into four latent classes: “very high”, “high”, “moderate” and “low”, with estimates of 2.2%, 16.4%, 35.1%, and 46.19%, respectively.

While the neural correlates of direct and averted gaze processing have been investigated, there is little consensus about how these gaze directions may be processed differently as a function of the task being performed. In a within-subject design, we examined how perception of direct and averted gaze affected performance on tasks requiring participants to use directly available facial cues to infer the individuals' emotional state (emotion discrimination), direction of attention (attention discrimination) and gender (gender discrimination). Neural activity was recorded throughout the three tasks using EEG, and ERPs time-locked to face onset were analyzed. Participants were most accurate at discriminating emotions with direct gaze faces, but most accurate at discriminating attention with averted gaze faces, while gender discrimination was not affected by gaze direction. At the neural level, direct and averted gaze elicited different patterns of activation depending on the task over frontal sites, from approximately 220-290 ms. More positive amplitudes were seen for direct than averted gaze in the emotion discrimination task. In contrast, more positive amplitudes were seen for averted gaze than for direct gaze in the gender discrimination task.

This research focuses on the kind of subversive humor that questions and confronts sexist ideology and behaviors and has come to be called subversive humor against sexism or feminist humor. Despite repeated allusions to the subversive function of this type of humor, no empirical evidence shows that subversive humor against sexism constitutes an empirical entity independent from other types of humor. After conceptually defining subversive humor against sexism, in Study 1, five experts analyzed the content validity of a pool of subversive humorous stimuli compared to stimuli from other humor categories (i.e., man disparagement humor and neutral humor). In Study 2 (n = 203), exploratory factor analysis (EFA) empirically isolated three related factors identified as subversive humor against sexism, man disparagement humor and neutral humor.

753,"© 2019 John Wiley & Sons LtdThis article is a theoretical treatment of feminist epistemology of crime, which advocates the centrality of gender as a theoretical starting point for the investigating of digital crimes. It does so by exploring the synergy between the feminist perspectives and the Tripartite Cybercrime Framework (TCF) (which argues that three possible factors motivate cybercrimes – socioeconomic, psychosocial, and geopolitical) to critique mainstream criminology and the meaning of the term “cybercrime”. Additionally, the article examines gender gaps in online harassment, cyber-bullying, cyber-fraud, revenge porn, and cyber-stalking to demonstrate that who is victimised, why, and to what effect are the critical starting points for the analysis of the connections between gender and crimes. In turn, it uses the lens of intersectionality to acknowledge that, while conceptions of gender and crime interact, they intersect with other categories (e.g., sexuality) to provide additional layers of explanation. To nuance the utilitarian value of the synergy between the TCF and the feminist perspectives, the focus shifts to a recent case study (which compared socioeconomic and psychosocial cybercrimes). The article concludes that, while online and offline lives are inextricably intertwined, the victimisations in psychosocial cybercrimes may be more gendered than in socioeconomic cybercrimes. These contributions align the TCF to the feminist epistemology of crime in their attempt to move gender analysis of digital crimes “from margin to centre”.",2019-01-01,Journal,Article,International Social Science Journal,27217,14,69,Just married: the synergy between feminist criminology and the Tripartite Cybercrime Framework,2,,10.1111/issj.12201,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
754,"© 2019 Sara A. Jahnke et al.Intro. Both discrimination and harassment directly impact mental and physical health. Further, workplace discrimination degrades workplace culture and negatively impacts health behaviors, job-related outcomes, and family dynamics. Women represent a small proportion of the fire service and are often the targets of discrimination/harassment, yet little research documents the impact of such experiences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between chronic work discrimination and/or harassment and women firefighters' (FFs) physical and mental health, substance abuse, and job efficacy, stress, and satisfaction. Methods. Snowball sampling was used to solicit participation from women career FFs. Participants completed an online survey regarding physical and mental health, health behavior, job efficacy/stress/satisfaction, and family well-being. Logistic regression examined the impact of work discrimination-harassment severity on dichotomous variables. Results. 1,773 had complete data on their experiences with work-related discrimination and harassment. Women reported experiencing verbal (37.5%) and written (12.9%) harassment, hazing (16.9%), sexual advances (37.4%), and assaults (5.1%) in the fire service. FFs in the highest tertile of work discrimination-harassment severity reported over 40% more poor health days in the last 30 days (OR=1.42; 95%CI=1.33-1.51; p<0.001). Women who experienced moderate and severe discrimination/harassment had negative mental health outcomes including higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Those who experienced high rates of discrimination and/or harassment also were more likely to report issues with alcohol consumption. Conclusion. The impact of discrimination and harassment, related negative physical and mental outcomes, low levels of job satisfaction, and negative impact of these experiences on family/home stress likely take a significant toll on women in the fire service. Findings confirm and extend previous work suggesting there is a need to improve the mental and physical health of women FFs.

The increasing cases of feminist YouTubers suffering online harassment prove that this kind of aggression intensifies when the victim is a woman and a feminist. This paper aims to explore the scope and strategies of antifeminist cyber violence embedded within the YouTube comment section. In order to achieve the research goal, this work draws from a case study: the comments on the video Why I’m… a feminist, posted by the American YouTuber Laci Green (2014). A qualitative content analysis is undertaken of these comments, whose interpretation takes as a reference Cole’s theory (2015) based on Foucault’s model of disciplinary rhetoric (1975). According to the results, “insult”, “sarcasm”, “imposition”, “wish to hurt”, “sexual objectification”, “criminalization/ defamation” and “threat” (both general and sexually explicit) constitute coercion mechanisms that are systematically applied to silence feminist women. Likewise, the misconception of feminism, that is, the advocacy of a mistaken and stereotyped version of this concept, represents a common pattern with high potential to promote future situations of cyber violence. The progressive normalization of cyber violence against women and girls requires an urgent response. In addition to measures of social awareness, a more rigorous online regulation would be essential for ensuring the predominance of respect and empowerment instead of violence and discrimination in the virtual world.",2019-01-01,Journal,Article,Papers,5600153108,3,104,Cyber violence on the Web: New forms of disciplinary rhetoric against feminism Ciberviolencia en la red.

Informed by an intersectionality framework that facilitates an understanding of intragroup dynamics, this exploratory qualitative study used in-depth interviews to ask 20 people with MHCs and family members of people with MHCs who also identified as of color and/or LGB about their experiences (a) with mental illness discrimination and supports within their identity communities and (b) in peer- and family-run programs. Participants of color reported that their racial ethnic communities commonly deny that MHCs exist and shame people with MHCs, and LGB participants said that LGB communities often exclude and stereotype them. Interactions with others with MHCs and affirmation of lesbian and gay identities serve as recovery supports within identity communities. Peer- and family-run programs provide a sense of humanization and education, respectively but are sites of heterosexism and may not address the needs of people of color; identity-specific programs are therefore desired. We describe variations in experiences related to race, ethnicity, and sexuality intersections; no differences in descriptions of mental illness discrimination in the focal identity communities emerged between people with MHCs versus family members.

Prior to the woman viewing the film, participants were randomly assigned to a peer norm manipulation wherein the male confederates set a misogynistic or ambiguous norm. Results indicated the presence of a misogynistic peer norm decreased the likelihood and speed of intervention. Among men exposed to misogynistic, compared to ambiguous, peer norms, men who strongly endorsed the status male role norm were less likely to display prosocial bystander behavior.

760,"© 2018 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.Objectives/Hypothesis: To determine if gender pay disparity exists amongst otolaryngologists employed by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Study Design: cross-sectional analysis. Methods: Board-certified otolaryngologists employed at all complex Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) in 2016 were identified. Salaries were collated using the Enterprise Human Resources Integration–Statistical Data Mart dataset. Additional variables, including gender, years since medical school graduation, professorship status, h-index, and geographic location were collected. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed where salary was the primary outcome of interest and gender was accounted for as an independent predictor while controlling for professional characteristics, geographic location, and seniority. Results: Sixty-nine VHA surgical programs with an operative designation of “complex” were identified. Two hundred sixty board-certified otolaryngologists, including 197 (75.8%) men and 63 (24.2%) women, were identified. Salary data were available on 210 of these otolaryngologists. In 2016, the mean salary for male and female otolaryngologists was not significantly different ($266,707 ± $31,624 vs. $264,674 ± $27,027, P =.918) nor were salaries in early career ($243,979 ± $31,749 vs. $254,625 ± $24,558, respectively; P =.416). On multivariate linear regression analysis, number of years since graduation (P =.009) and h-index (P =.049) were independent predictors of salary, but gender, geographic location, and faculty rank were not. Conclusions: Although the gender pay gap persists in many areas of medicine and surgery, otolaryngologists employed at complex VAMCs do not experience gender pay disparity. The use of specific and objective criteria to establish and adjust salaries can reduce and potentially eliminate gender pay disparity. These findings may help to guide institutional policies in other practice environments. Level of Evidence: 2b.

761,"© The Author(s) 2018.The aim of the article is to explore the psychic life of executive women under neoliberalism using psychosocial approaches. The article shows how, despite enduring unfair treatment and access to opportunities, many executive women remain emotionally invested in upholding the neoliberal ideal that if one perseveres, one shall be successful, regardless of gender. Drawing on psychosocial approaches, we explore how the accounts given by some executive women of repudiation, as denying gender inequality, and individualization, as subjects completely agentic, are underpinned by the unconscious, intertwined processes of splitting and blaming. Women sometimes split off undesirable aspects of the workplace, which repudiates gender inequality, or blame other women, which individualizes failure and responsibility for change. We explain that splitting and blaming enable some executive women to manage the anxiety evoked from threats to the neoliberal ideal of the workplace. This article thereby makes a contribution to existing postfeminist scholarship by integrating psychosocial approaches to the study of the psychic life of neoliberal executive women, by exploring why they appear unable to engage directly with and redress instances of gender discrimination in the workplace.",2019-01-01,Journal,Article,Human Relations,27069,29,72,Splitting and blaming: The psychic life of neoliberal executive women,1,true,10.1177/0018726718772010,SAGE Publications Ltdinfo@sagepub.co.uk,761,Psychology of Religion and Spirituality,2019.0,51.0,0.0,,14323768,M.

762,"© 2018 American Psychological AssociationSexism has deep roots in human history, including most religious traditions. Many religious organizations and traditions, including Judeo-Christian beliefs, subtly approve of and espouse sexism. Previous research has detailed how religiosity and sexism, particularly benevolent sexism, are positively correlated. Given these connections, we examined whether supraliminal or subliminal religious priming influenced reported benevolent and hostile sexism in Belgium (Experiments 1–2) and the United States (Experiments 3–4). Across four experiments, priming Judeo-Christian concepts increased self-reported benevolent sexism. In addition, differentiating types of religious primes into subgroups of religious agent, religious institution, and spiritual words revealed that exposure to religious agent primes resulted in higher levels of benevolent sexism compared to other groups (Experiment 4). These results provide empirical evidence that religion can act to bolster benevolent sexist ideals, which reinforce an unequal relationship between men and women.

763,"© 2018 Hannover, Gubernath, Schultze and Zander.The New Year's Eve 2015 mass sexual assaults in Germany led to a broader debate about whether the perpetrators, most of them self-identifying as Muslims, were encouraged to such acts by particularly sexist attitudes toward girls and women. Here, we argue that it is not the specific religious affiliation of individuals per se that predicts sexism. Rather it should be the extent to which they are involved in their religion, i.e., their religiosity and their endorsement of religious fundamentalism. In line with the theory of ambivalent sexism, we distinguish hostile and benevolent sexism, while controlling for right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. In two Pilot Studies, we explored differences in ambivalent sexism (a) between male and female individuals of Muslim faith, Christian faith, Muslim faith, Christian faith, and no religious affiliation residing in Germany, while at the same time (b) differentiating between sexism directed toward girls and sexism directed toward women. In our Main Study, we tested the interrelations between religiosity, religious fundamentalism, and ambivalent sexism in our religious subsamples of male Christians, female Christians, male Muslims, and female Muslims using a multigroup multivariate moderated mediation analysis. In all three studies, Muslims were more religious, endorsed religious fundamentalism more strongly, and held stronger benevolent sexist beliefs toward girls and women as well as stronger hostile sexist beliefs toward women than Christians and non-religious participants. In our Main Study, with female Christians as the reference group, male Muslims' stronger benevolent and hostile sexist beliefs toward girls were mediated by religiosity and fundamentalism. Female Muslims' stronger endorsement of benevolent sexism toward girls could be explained by their higher level of fundamentalism. While our findings show that differences in ambivalent sexism between religious groups were partly due to different levels of religiosity and fundamentalism, they also suggest that there are factors other than those investigated in our studies responsible for male Muslims' particularly strong sexism.

The active role of the father in sex ratio bias at birth has been neglected until recently. The human sex ratio at birth is biased towards sons, although in occidental populations, the ratio has decreased regularly for 30 years and could be the consequence of the adverse effects of environmental chemicals on male hormones. In a Malagasy primate, the lesser mouse lemur, the potential effect of paternal testosterone levels on sex ratio bias at birth was tested on 130 litters (278 babies) produced in 52 mixed-sex groups. For each group, social dominance among males was characterized based on aggressive interactions and sexual behaviours. Using a multi correspondence analysis, high testosterone levels in grouped males, particularly those of the dominant male, were significantly correlated with more infants produced in male-biased litters, independent of the female condition. According to these results, predictions for sex ratio bias towards one sex or the other in mouse lemurs were discussed considering the influence of both parents.",2018-12-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,4,13,Revisiting the Trivers-Willard theory on birth sex ratio bias: Role of paternal condition in a Malagasy primate,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0209640,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,765,Sex Roles,2018.0,80.0,0.0,,46837647,Glenna L.

766,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The present study investigated how task demand (cognitive load and interactivity) and avatar sexualization in a video game influenced rape myth acceptance (RMA), hostile sexism, and self-objectification. In a between-subjects design, 300 U.S. college students either played or watched someone else play a videogame as either a sexualized or non-sexualized female avatar under high (memorize 7 symbols) or low (memorize 2 symbols) cognitive load. Hypotheses were derived from the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) and perspectives on stereotype processing. Results contradicted hypotheses that greater task demands and sexualization would produce greater RMA, hostile sexism, and self-objectification. Instead, we found that sexualization did not affect these variables. Greater cognitive load reduced rape myth acceptance and hostile sexism for those in the sexualized avatar condition, but it did not affect self-objectification. We discuss these results with respect to the LC4MP and suggest that the processing of stereotype-inconsistent information might be the underlying cause of these unexpected findings.

767,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Findings regarding the effectiveness of (non)traditionally gendered advertisements are mixed and largely emanate from the United States. We tested the stereotype content model and ambivalent sexism theory cross-nationally in an advertising context and predicted that paternalistic (vs. envious) female stereotypes will trigger higher purchase intent (PI) irrespective of country (Hypothesis 1), viewers’ benevolent sexism will positively predict PI for paternalistic housewife advertisements (Hypothesis 2a), viewers’ hostile sexism will negatively predict PI for envious businesswoman advertisements (Hypothesis 2b), and these relationships with sexism will be confined to less gender egalitarian countries (i.e., Poland and South Africa) (Hypothesis 3). Statistical analyses of data from 468 Polish, South African, and British university students supported Hypothesis 1 and partially supported Hypotheses 2 and 3. The predicted patterns held for South Africa, but in Poland, viewers’ benevolence positively predicted PI for both advertisement types, with the exception of highly hostile women. British viewers’ hostility positively predicted PI for the housewife advertisement.

768,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Forensic entomologists rely on insects present in human remains to establish a minimum postmortem interval (PMImin). Blowflies have been widely used in these estimates because they lay eggs on the victim's body shortly after death and, within hours, larvae hatch and grow at predictable rates. Hence, isomegalen diagrams based on larval size and local temperature are considered good models to estimate PMImin. Still, most professional do not account for size sexual dimorphism in blowflies, which add uncertainty to predictive models by two mechanisms: (1) males and females might grow up to different sizes, and; (2) males and females might grow at different rates. In this study, we investigate sexual dimorphism and biases on the prediction of adult size in three species of blowflies (Lucilia sericata, Calliphora vicina and Calliphora vomitoria) reared under different larval densities. Estimated size range, stablished with and without sex discrimination, showed that females were larger than males in the three species. The ultimate size of adult stage, however, was more difficult to predict. C. vicina and C. vomitoria decrease as density raises but at different rates, and even males and females of the same species react differently to density increase. Adult size of L. sericata, in contrast, shows a slight increase with density. Except for C. vomitoria females, estimated size ranges are lower when species are divided by sex. Our results show that sex is an important factor to consider in PMImin estimates. Scenarios for all three species shorten their estimated size ranges when compared to databases with no sex identification. Therefore, computing data by sex raises accuracy in size based predictive models.",2018-12-01,Journal,Article,Forensic Science International,27743,7,293,Sexual size dimorphism in three species of forensically important blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and its implications for postmortem interval estimation,0,false,10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.10.009,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,768,Scientific Reports,2018.0,79.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is found that women have strong preferences for girls and men have preferences for boys, and only limited support is found for predictions derived from the Trivers-Willard Hypothesis.'}",49090432,R.

770,"© 2018 American Psychological Association.Although women's underrepresentation in senior-level positions in the workplace has multiple causes, women's self-improvement or ""empowerment"" at work has recently attracted cultural attention as a solution. For example, the bestselling book Lean In states that women can tackle gender inequality themselves by overcoming the ""internal barriers"" (e.g., lack of confidence and ambition) that prevent success. We sought to explore the consequences of this type of women's empowerment ideology. Study 1 found that perceptions of women's ability to solve inequality were associated with attributions of women's responsibility to do so. Studies 2, 3, 5a, and 5b experimentally manipulated exposure to women's empowerment messages, finding that while such messages increase perceptions that women are empowered to solve workplace gender inequality, they also lead to attributions that women are more responsible both for creating and solving the problem. Study 4 found a similar pattern in the context of a specific workplace problem, and found that such messages also lead to a preference for interventions focused on changing women rather than changing the system. Studies 5a and 5b sought to replicate prior studies and document the weakened effects of messages that explicitly explain that women's ""internal barriers"" are the products of ""external barriers"" obstructing women's progress.

Previous work has produced evidence of such biases in medical students. Objective: To identify contextual attributes in medical schools associated on average with low levels of racial/gender clinical decision-making biases. Design: A mixed-method design using comparison case studies of 15 medical schools selected based on results of a previous survey of student decision-making bias: 7 schools whose students collectively had, and 8 schools whose students had not shown evidence of such biases. Participants: Purposively sampled faculty, staff, underrepresented minority medical students, and clinical-level medical students at each school. Main Measures: Quantitative descriptive data and qualitative interview and focus group data assessing 32 school attributes theorized in the literature to be associated with formation of decision-making and biases. We used a mixed-method analytic design with standard qualitative analysis and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Key Results: Across the 15 schools, a total of 104 faculty, administrators and staff and 21 students participated in individual interviews, and 196 students participated in 29 focus groups.

772,"© 2018 The Author(s).The psychiatric classification of ""normal"" versus disordered sexual behavior has been a subject of some dispute. Although atypical sexual interests have been viewed traditionally as typically male, epidemiological data indicate its presence in both genders. We examined how gender and sexual orientation influence whether or not atypical sexual behavior is classified as a mental disorder. Mental health professionals (N = 546) were presented with five case vignettes where subjects exhibit paraphilic behaviors; one case with psychotic symptoms served as the control condition. For each vignette we randomly changed the described subject's gender (male/female), sexual orientation (homosexual/heterosexual), and presented diagnostic criteria (fulfilled/ambiguous). Female subjects were significantly less pathologized and overall more stigmatized in terms of exhibitionistic, frotteuristic, sexual sadistic and pedophilic behavior. On the other hand, female sexual behavior that fulfilled diagnostic criteria for masochistic disorder was more pathologized.

773,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.We explored whether the existence of gender bias causes gender gaps in STEM engagement. In Experiment 1 (n = 322), U.S. women projected less sense of belonging, positivity toward, and aspirations to participate in STEM than did men when exposed to the reality of STEM gender bias. These gender differences disappeared when participants were told that STEM exhibits gender equality, suggesting that gender bias produces STEM gender gaps. Experiment 2 (n = 429) explored whether results generalized to a specific STEM department, and whether organizational efforts to mitigate gender bias might shrink gender gaps. U.S. women exposed to a biased chemistry department anticipated more discrimination and projected less sense of belonging, positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men. These gender differences vanished when participants read about an unbiased department, again suggesting that gender bias promotes STEM gender gaps. Further, moderated mediation analyses suggested that in the presence of gender bias (but not gender equality), women projected less positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men because they experienced less sense of belonging and anticipated more discrimination.

774,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: The literature investigating female and male medical students' differing career intentions is extensive. However, medical school experiences and their implications for professional identity formation and specialty choice have attracted less attention. In this study we explore the impact of medical school experiences on students' specialty preferences, investigate gender similarities and differences, and discuss how both might be related to gender segregation in specialty preference. Methods: In a questionnaire, 250 Swedish final-year medical students described experiences that made them interested and uninterested in a specialty. Utilizing a sequential mixed methods design, their responses were analyzed qualitatively to create categories that were compared quantitatively. Results: Similar proportions of women and men became interested in a specialty based on its knowledge area, patient characteristics, and potential for work-life balance. These aspects, however, often became secondary to whether they felt included or excluded in clinical settings. More women than men had been deterred by specialties with excluding, hostile, or sexist workplace climates (W = 44%, M = 16%). In contrast, more men had been discouraged by specialties' knowledge areas (W = 27%, M = 47%). Conclusions: Male and female undergraduates have similar incentives and concerns regarding their career. However, the prevalence of hostility and sexism in the learning environment discourages especially women from some specialties. To reduce gender segregation in specialty choice, energy should be directed towards counteracting hostile workplace climates that explain apparent stereotypical assumptions about career preferences of men and women.",2018-11-19,Journal,Article,BMC Medical Education,28099,14,18,To select or be selected - Gendered experiences in clinical training affect medical students' specialty preferences,1,true,10.1186/s12909-018-1361-5,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,774,Journal of Women & Aging,2018.0,52.0,2.0,,1411446791,Ateret Gewirtz-Meydan,2899412,L.

All 39 dating sites for older adults were located through the Google search engine.

The visual analysis in the present study revealed a clear intersection between ageism and sexism in the presentation of older adults. The majority of men and women were smiling and had a fair complexion, with light eye color and perceived age of younger than 60. Older women were presented as younger and wore more cosmetics as compared with older men. The present study stresses the social regulation of sexuality, as only heterosexual couples were presented.

The objective of this study was to identify if sex bias continues to exist in present day clinical trials entered into ClinicalTrials.gov. We hypothesize that males and females are not equally represented in recent clinical trials. Materials and Methods: Data were abstracted from all interventional Phase I, II, and III clinical trials with adult subjects entered into ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 and completed by November 30, 2015. Number and sex of subjects, funding source, allocation, end point classification, interventional model, and purpose were recorded. Studies pertaining to diseases that were sex specific were excluded. Results: Of 1,668 studies included in the initial search, 167 were excluded due to sex-specific study topic. Of the remaining 1,501 studies, 177,656 (51.1%) male and 170,331 (49.0%) female subjects were included. There was a significant difference in the sex of the subjects included in Phase I (64.1% male/35.9% female), Phase II (48.4% male/51.6% female), and Phase III (51.0% male/49.1% female) clinical trials (p < 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant difference in the sex of the subjects included in industry (50.7% male/49.3% female), National Institutes of Health (NIH) (56.6% male/43.4% female), ""Other US Federal"" (62.5% male/37.5% female), and ""Other"" funded (53.4% male/46.6% female) clinical trials (p < 0.0001), as well as between randomized (50.5% male/49.6% female) and nonrandomized (54.8% male/45.2% female) clinical trials (p < 0.0001). Upon evaluating if the sex of the subjects included in the individual clinical trials was equally matched, we found that only 4.1% of clinical trials had 100% sex matching, 22.2% had 80% sex matching, and 56.5% had 50% sex matching. Using a liberal 50% sex-matching criteria, Phase III and II clinical trials matched the sex of the subjects more frequently compared to Phase I trials (60.8%, 57.8%, and 45.5%, respectively, p = 0.003).

Head CT scans of 140 Bulgarian adults were used in the study. The segmentation of the skulls was performed in the software InVesalius. The length, breadth, circumference, and area were measured based on the 3D coordinates of definite landmarks and semi-landmarks. The circumference and area were calculated regarding the foramen as a 2D and 3D structure. Two additional variables (λ 2 and λ 3 ) corresponding to the least square errors along the length and breadth directions at the fitting of the 3D coordinates to a plane were examined for their sex discriminating ability. The FM shape was classified based on the values of the FM index. The significance of the sex differences was assessed. Discriminate function analysis and binary logistic regression were conducted. Significant sex differences were established in the FM size and shape. The eigenvalue λ 3 is the best discriminating parameter applying discriminant function analysis.

Three online studies were conducted. For each study, a U.S. community sample was recruited. In Study 1 (n = 602), women reported greater intentions to engage in feminist action than men did. Men, however, were just as willing as women to participate in protective action. In Study 2 (n = 726), we replicated these gender differences and found that protective action was positively predicted by benevolent sexism among men. In Study 3 (N = 582), we investigated why women reported greater intentions to engage in feminist action compared to men. We found that women were more aware of gender inequality, which was associated with identification as a feminist, and through this, intentions to engage in feminist action. Awareness of gender inequality also predicted intentions to engage in protective action among women. Men, however, were less aware of gender inequality, which was associated with the belief that feminist action leads to women having more rights than men do and subsequently greater willingness to participate in protective action.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how norms of freedom of expression are changing in an online communication environment dominated by these platforms. Design/methodology/approach: Four focus groups were conducted in this study. Participants needed to use at least one social media platform daily. Groups were homogeneous in terms of race and gender: African-American females, African-American males, white females and white males. Findings: Participants in general did not report a strong willingness to censor extreme speech on social media platforms. Rather, they expressed apathy and cynicism toward both their own and social media companies’ ability to combat extreme speech and make online discourse more positive. Female participants tended to value the overall health of public discourse and protection of more vulnerable social media users on social media platforms. African-American female participants called for platforms to recognize a special duty to protect minority users, whom they saw as responsible for the platforms’ success. Research limitations/implications: Focus groups are useful for providing exploratory rather than generalizable data. However, by increasing the understanding of how individuals define extreme speech on social media, these data can reveal how individuals rhetorically shape the social media platforms and interpret their role in democratic discourse.

786,"© 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.Historically, women have been underrepresented in clinical research, requiring physicians to extrapolate medical recommendations for women from clinical research done in cohorts consisting predominantly of male participants. While government-funded clinical research has achieved gender parity in phase-3 clinical trials across many biomedical disciplines, improvements are still needed in several facets of women's health research, such as the inclusion of women in early-phase clinical trials, the inclusion of pregnant women and women with physical and intellectual disabilities, the consideration of sex as a biological variable in preclinical research, and the analysis and reporting of sex and gender differences across the full biomedical research continuum. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Women's Health and the Office of Women's Health of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cosponsored a preconference symposium at the 25th Annual Women's Health Congress, held in Arlington, VA in April, 2017, to highlight gains made and remaining needs regarding the representation of women in clinical research, to introduce innovative procedures and technologies, and to outline revised policy for future studies.

All rights reserved.As women enter the dental profession in increasing numbers in North America and around the world, the questions of how they perceive their environment and what kind of barriers they face are important subjects to be addressed. The aim of this study was to assess and compare women dental students' perceptions of bias in their environment and experiences of sexual misconduct at one dental school in each of four countries. In spring 2017, 1,293 female students at four dental schools in the U.S., Bulgaria, Brazil, and India were invited to participate in a 24-item survey developed by researchers from the four countries; 990 students responded (response rate 76.6%). The overall majority of the respondents reported thinking the admissions process at their school was fair (79.7%); but a fifth of U.S. and Brazilian students perceived their school was not fully embracing of females, with most Bulgarian students agreeing (87.2%) and all Indian students disagreeing. Most respondents overall perceived that male faculty members did not favor male students (79.5%) and did not think there was discrimination against female students by faculty (87.1%), but half of the U.S. respondents reported feeling discriminated against by both male faculty and male students. When the responses ""I've been verbally harassed"" and ""I've been somewhat verbally harassed"" were combined, 10.1% of the U.S. respondents reported verbal harassment, compared to 20% of Brazilian, 15% of Bulgarian, and 2% of Indian respondents. When the responses ""I've been sexually assaulted"" and ""I've been somewhat sexually assaulted"" were combined, 6% of U.S. respondents reported being sexually assaulted, compared to 6.2% of Brazilian, 2.5% of Bulgarian, and none of the Indian respondents. Almost half (46.9%) of these students overall perceived their school was not or only somewhat vigilant about issues of sexual misconduct, and only 54% said they would feel comfortable or very comfortable reporting misconduct.

While men tended to attribute more blame to the victim than women, gender ideology emerged as a stronger predictor of rape attributions, and some types of sexist beliefs were associated with greater victim blaming and others with less victim blaming. Endorsement of hostile sexism, rape myths, and heterosexual intimacy was generally associated with the attribution of greater victim culpability, as well as less perpetrator culpability, perpetrator criminality, and victim credibility. However, complementary gender differentiation was associated with greater perpetrator culpability and criminality, while protective paternalism was associated with greater victim credibility. Observers attributed lower victim culpability and greater perpetrator criminality when the victim’s drink was spiked, and attributed greater perpetrator culpability when the victim verbally resisted the perpetrator’s advances. Given the implications that observer attitudes can have on professional and personal support for survivors, as well as juror decision making, the ongoing examination of the complex interplay between the person and situational factors affecting attributions of rape is essential.

791,"© 2018, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.Background: When skeletonized human remains are found determination of sex is an essential step in compiling the so-called biological profile of the decedent. Apart from biomolecular methods, the other most commonly used methods for sex determination are based on the assessment of morphological characteristics of the skull and pelvis. Because incomplete skeletons and fragmented skull or pelvic bones are frequently encountered in forensic casework, it is useful to investigate alternative morphological characteristics or measurements that may prove to show good correlation with sex. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate if the morphology of the human hard palate correlates with sex. To this end, postmortem computed tomography (CT) data sets were used to obtain hard palate measurements from 3D skull reconstructions. Material and methods: Digital hard palate measurements (palate height, anterior palate height, palate width, and anterior palate width) were acquired from 58 3D-reconstructed skulls (40 male, mean age 41.7 years; 18 female, mean age 46.6 years). Using the measurements for palate height and width, a palate-height index was calculated to characterize palate convexity. Results: Pearson’s correlation analysis did not reveal a significant statistical correlation between sex and anterior palate height, palate width or anterior palate width. In contrast, with a Pearson significance level of 99% (2-sided), a positive correlation between palate height and sex could be demonstrated. Nevertheless, due to its poor discriminatory power, this positive correlation does not represent a tool for sex discrimination in practice. Conclusion: With respect to hard palate concavity, the palate-height index could be calculated for 20 of the 40 male individuals and for 6 of the 18 female individuals. Most of the male individuals thus had medium height palates, whereas most of the female individuals had shallow, low height palates, and none had high palates. Hence, medium height and, especially, high palates probably suggest a male individual. Palate concavity might, therefore, find use as a supplementary field test. Clearly, these parameters should be tested for a considerably larger sample size, preferably one in which the proportion of the sexes is better balanced.",2018-10-01,Journal,Article,Rechtsmedizin,27795,1,28,Osteological sex determination using hard palate measurements Osteologische Geschlechtsbestimmung anhand von Gaumenmaßen,0,false,10.1007/s00194-018-0254-6,Springer Verlagservice@springer.de,791,Current Opinion in Neurobiology,2018.0,71.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Novel data reinforce the idea of a bisexual layout of cortical anatomy, and Converging evidence suggests that prefrontal areas contribute to social interaction processing and determining social hierarchies.'}",145007935,M.

Converging evidence suggests that prefrontal areas contribute to social interaction processing and determining social hierarchies. In social interactions, we identify gender in split seconds, but after centuries of anatomy we are still unable to distinguish male and female cortices.

793,"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.Recently, there has been an upsurge of attention focused on bias and its impact on specialized artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Allegations of racism and sexism have permeated the conversation as stories surface about search engines delivering job postings for well-paying technical jobs to men and not women, or providing arrest mugshots when keywords such as “black teenagers” are entered. Learning algorithms are evolving; they are often created from parsing through large datasets of online information while having truth labels bestowed on them by crowd-sourced masses. These specialized AI algorithms have been liberated from the minds of researchers and startups, and released onto the public. Yet intelligent though they may be, these algorithms maintain some of the same biases that permeate society. They find patterns within datasets that reflect implicit biases and, in so doing, emphasize and reinforce these biases as global truth. This paper describes specific examples of how bias has infused itself into current AI and robotic systems, and how it may affect the future design of such systems. More specifically, we draw attention to how bias may affect the functioning of (1) a robot peacekeeper, (2) a self-driving car, and (3) a medical robot.

794,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: This paper aims to provide insights into the role of traditional authorities in two maternal health programmes in Northern Malawi. Among strategies to improve maternal health, these authorities issue by-laws: local rules to increase the uptake of antenatal and delivery care. The study uses a framework of gendered institutions to critically assess the by-law content, process and effects and to understand how responsibilities and accountabilities are constructed, negotiated and reversed. Methods: Findings are based on a qualitative study in five health centre catchment areas in Northern Malawi. Data were collected using meeting observations and document search, 36 semi-structured individual interviews and 19 focus group discussions with female maternal health service users, male community members, health workers, traditional leaders, local officials and health committee members. A gender and power sensitive thematic analysis was performed focusing on the formulation, interpretation and implementation process of the by-laws as well as its effects on women and men. Results: In the study district, traditional leaders introduced three by-laws that oblige pregnant women to attend antenatal care; bring their husbands along and; and to give birth in a health centre. If women fail to comply with these rules, they risk being fined or denied access to maternal health services. The findings show that responsibilities and accountabilities are negotiated and that by-laws are not uniformly applied. Whereas local officials support the by-laws, lower level health cadres' and some community members contest them, in particular, the principles of individual responsibility and universality. Conclusions: The study adds new evidence on the understudied phenomenon of by-laws. From a gender perspective, the by-laws are problematic as they individualise the responsibility for maternal health care and discriminate against women in the definition and application of sanctions. Through the by-laws, supported by national policies and international institutions, women bear the full responsibility for failures in maternal health care, suggesting a form of 'reversed accountability' of women towards global maternal health goals. This can negatively impact on women's reproductive health rights and obstruct ambitions to achieve gender inequality and health equity.

795,"© 2018 Sterk, Meeussen and Van Laar.Previous research has revealed that women may attempt to avoid negative gender stereotypes in organizations through self-group distancing, or ""queen bee"", behaviors: emphasizing masculine qualities, distancing themselves from other women, and legitimizing organizational inequality. Factors that increase self-group distancing have been identified (e.g., existing discrimination and low group identification), but it is unknown how self-group distancing by an ingroup leader is perceived by and affects subordinates of the negatively stereotyped group. In the current study, female participants received ambiguous negative feedback from a male versus female leader displaying queen bee-type versus neutral behavior. As expected, a male leader displaying queen bee-type behavior was seen as having less positive intent than a male leader displaying neutral behavior, which in turn increased how sexist he was perceived to be. A female leader displaying queen bee (vs. neutral) behavior was not seen as having less positive intent, which thus did not indirectly influence perceived sexism. Behavior of both male and female leaders did affect junior women: participants exposed to a leader displaying queen bee-type behavior reported more anger, sadness, and anxiety than participants exposed to a leader displaying neutral behavior. These data provide further evidence that simply adding more women or minorities in key senior positions is insufficient to change inequality if bias in the organization is not tackled. Specifically, exposure to gender inequality can steer female leaders to endorse-rather than change-stereotypes about women, and this behavior is particularly consequential because it (a) might not be recognized as bias and (b) exerts negative effects.",2018-09-20,Journal,Article,Frontiers in Psychology,21100216571,16,9,Perpetuating inequality: Junior women do not see queen bee behavior as negative but are nonetheless negatively affected by it,1,true,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01690,Frontiers Media S.A.info@frontiersin.org,795,JAMA,2018.0,4.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An important account of the extent and persistence of sexual harassment of women in sciences, engineering, and medicine, its negative effects on careers and health, and solutions that work to empower women and bystanders to identify and report harassment and halt or deter inappropriate or illegal behavior are published.'}",2218641,A.

Gender disparities result in part from the accumulation of subtle, typically unintentional biases that pervade workplace structures, practices, and patterns of interactions that inadvertently favor men. However, the subtle nature of gender bias makes it difficult to detect and thus diminishes the likelihood of action to address it. We experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of a brief intervention, the Workshop Activity for Gender Equity Simulation in the Academy (WAGES-Academic), which was designed to increase recognition of subtle gender bias in the academic workplace. Participants (N = 177) completed either the WAGES intervention or one of two control conditions and later evaluated promotion and tenure materials of a woman faculty member who received either a blatant sexist, subtle sexist, or nonsexist review. Consistent with hypotheses, WAGES participants (vs. controls) detected more subtle gender bias (ps <.02) and were subsequently more likely to report concerns about bias (ps <.04).

In Western contexts, the Christianity-inspired principle of equality of all humans remains a latent principle operative toward greater gender egalitarianism.

The salient findings of these responses were explored in six subsequent focus group discussions. Findings: The study reveals no difference in how women perform leadership, except in terms of brokering skills in which women are perceived as superior to their male counterparts. Focus group discussion participants ascribed this difference to the Islamic benevolent sexism dynamic of according women greater respect, which facilitates their access to higher management.

800,"© 2018 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.Although “Girls are as good as boys at math” explicitly expresses equality, we predict it could nevertheless suggest that boys have more raw talent. In statements with this subject-complement structure, the item in the complement position serves as the reference point and is thus considered more typical and prominent. This explains why “Tents are like houses,” for instance, sounds better than “Houses are like tents”—people generally think of houses as more typical. For domains about ability, the reference point should be the item that is typically more skilled. We further propose that the reference point should be naturally more skilled. In two experiments, we presented adults with summaries of actual scientific evidence for gender equality in math (Experiment 1) or verbal ability (Experiment 2), but we manipulated whether the reference point in the statements of equality in the summaries (e.g., “Boys’ verbal ability is as good as girls’”) was girls or boys. As predicted, adults attributed more natural ability to each gender when it was in the complement rather than subject position. Yet, in Experiment 3, we found that when explicitly asked, participants judged that such sentences were not biased in favor of either gender, indicating that subject-complement statements must be transmitting this bias in a subtle way. Thus, statements such as “Girls are as good as boys at math” can actually backfire and perpetuate gender stereotypes about natural ability.",2018-09-01,Journal,Article,Cognitive Science,12874,26,42,“Girls Are as Good as Boys at Math” Implies That Boys Are Probably Better: A Study of Expressions of Gender Equality,0,false,10.1111/cogs.12637,Wiley-Blackwell Publishinginfo@wiley.com,800,PLoS ONE,2018.0,57.0,7.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The perception of fibromyalgia as almost exclusively a women’s disorder is not supported by data in unbiased studies, and the use of 2016 fibromy nostalgia criteria for clinical diagnosis and epidemiology is recommended because of its updated scoring and generalized pain requirement.'}",144408777,F.

In general, studies have failed to distinguish Criteria based fibromyalgia (CritFM) from Clinical fibromyalgia (ClinFM). In the current study we compare CritFM with ClinFM to investigate gender and other biases in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Methods We used a rheumatic disease databank and 2016 fibromyalgia criteria to study prevalence and sex ratios in a selection biased sample of 1761 referred and diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and in an unbiased sample of 4342 patients with no diagnosis with respect to fibromyalgia. We compared diagnostic and clinical variables according to gender, and we reanalyzed a German population study (GPS) (n = 2435) using revised 2016 criteria for fibromyalgia. Results In the selection-biased sample of referred patients with fibromyalgia, more than 90% were women. However, when an unselected sample of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was studied for the presence of fibromyalgia, women represented 58.7% of fibromyalgia cases. Women had slightly more symptoms than men, including generalized pain (36.8% vs. 32.4%), count of 37 symptoms (4.7 vs. 3.7) and mean polysymptomatic distress scores (10.2 vs. 8.2). We also found a linear relation between the probability of being females and fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia severity. Women in the GPS represented 59.2% of cases. Discussion The perception of fibromyalgia as almost exclusively (90%) a women’s disorder is not supported by data in unbiased studies. Using validated self-report criteria and unbiased selection, the female proportion of fibromyalgia cases was 60% in the unbiased studies, and the observed CritFM prevalence of fibromyalgia in the GPS was ~2%. ClinFM is the public face of fibromyalgia, but is severely affected by selection and confirmation bias in the clinic and publications, underestimating men with fibromyalgia and overestimating women. We recommend the use of 2016 fibromyalgia criteria for clinical diagnosis and epidemiology because of its updated scoring and generalized pain requirement. Fibromyalgia and generalized pain positivity, widespread pain (WPI), symptom severity scale (SSS) and polysymptomatic distress (PSD) scale should always be reported.",2018-09-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,124,13,"Fibromyalgia diagnosis and biased assessment: Sex, prevalence and bias",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0203755,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,801,,2018.0,0.0,0.0,,10785563,Sumati,33769268,A.

Many skeletal features vary by gender, thus determination of sex is prerequisite for the identification of an individual. The success in sex determination from bones is limited by the availability of bones in fragments. The talus is apt for studying sexual dimorphism as it is often well preserved due to its durability. Aim: To determine accuracy of talus in sex determination and to derive sex discriminant function equations specific for Gujarati population of Anand region. Materials and Methods: Seven measurements of 58 adult human tali (36 male and 22 female) have been taken by digital sliding vernier caliper. The seven measurements taken in the present study are talar length, width of the talus, head-neck length, length and breadth of the trochlea, transverse and antero-posterior diameter of the posterior articular surface for the calcaneus. Data has been statistically analysed by discriminant function analysis. Results: Univariate analysis showed that the mean (SD) values of all the parameters of talus are significantly greater in males as compared to females (p<0.001 indicating good discrimination). Discriminant function analysis with stepwise method revealed that length of the trochlea, head-neck length and transverse diameter of the posterior articular surface for the calcaneus emerged as the most significant discriminating parameters with correct classification rate of 96.6%. Conclusion: The sex discriminant function equations derived in the present study can be used for sex determination studies on the tali obtained specifically from Gujarati population of Anand region.",2018-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,16400154778,2,12,Sex determination from talus among gujarati population of anand region by discriminant function analysis,1,true,10.7860/JCDR/2018/35399.11960,"Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic ResearchNo 3, 1/9 Roop Nagar,GT Karnal RoadDelhi110007",802,Journal of Forensic Radiology and Imaging,2018.0,19.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results showed that males exhibited greater mean values for all the measurements except for left orbital width that was slightly increased in females, and there were significant differences in gender-based orbital aperture measures.'}",32686138,A.

The study included 92 subjects (44 males and 48 females) with age ranged from 18 to 65 years. The results showed that males exhibited greater mean values for all the measurements except for left orbital width that was slightly increased in females. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between males and females regarding right orbital height, right and left area and inter zygomatic distance. The accuracy of correct sex classification was achieved up to 74.7%. Discriminant analysis revealed that inter zygomatic distances showed significant discrimination (p = 0.028) between both sexes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for sex discrimination demonstrated that inter zygomatic distance at a cutoff of 96.7, had sensitivity of 76.7%, specificity of 65% and accuracy 71% (p < 0.001).

804,"© 2018 Elsevier Inc.As a major public health issue, human trafficking (HT) affects individuals, families, communities, and societies around the world. A public health approach to combating HT has been advocated. Such an approach seeks to prevent HT by engaging diverse stakeholder groups in addressing risk factors at multiple levels. As a key stakeholder group, health care professionals (HCPs) play a critical role in HT prevention. Herein, we use the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Social-Ecological Model as a framework to present potential HT prevention strategies for health care professionals. As clinicians, HCPs may deliver tailored interventions to patients and families to address individual- and relationship-level risk factors for HT in the health care setting. As educators, advocates, and researchers, HCPs may collaborate across sectors to implement community- and society-level prevention strategies. Such strategies may include enhancing awareness of HT through education; advocating for local and national policies that promote community health and wellness; combating social or cultural norms that contribute to HT; and building a strong evidence-base to guide future HT prevention programs.

805,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Sexual dimorphism has been proposed as one of the facial traits to have evolved through sexual selection and to affect attractiveness perception. Even with numerous studies documenting its effect on attractiveness and mate choice, the neurophysiological correlates of the perception of sexual dimorphism are not yet fully understood. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during visualisation of faces that had been previously transformed in shape to appear more masculine or more feminine. The participants’ task consisted of judging the attractiveness of half of the total number of faces, and performing a sex discrimination task on the other half. Both early and late potentials were modulated by the sex of faces, whereas the effect of the sexually dimorphic transform was mainly visible in the P2 (positive deflection around 200 ms after stimulus onset), EPN (early posterior negativity) and LPP (late positive potential) components. There was an effect of sexual dimorphism on P2 and EPN amplitudes when female participants visualised male faces, which may indicate that masculinity is particularly attended to when viewing opposite sex members. Also, ERP results seem to support the idea of sex differences in social categorisation decisions regarding faces, although differences were not evident on behavioural results.

806,"© 2018 Association of Program Directors in SurgeryObjective: Feedback is critical to the development of medical students. To enhance feedback, we created a web application, the Minute Feedback System (MFS). This app allows students to request precise, timely, written feedback from residents and staff without the burden of vague, end-of-rotation surveys. In this study, we investigate variations in response rates and feedback fatigue based on sex and rank (resident/fellow vs. faculty). Design: Data were collected from May 2015-October 2016. The MFS stores student requests for feedback along with faculty responses allowing for analysis of feedback response rate as well as sex and rank identification. Variation in response rate was analyzed using Chi-square and log-rank testing. Feedback fatigue was assessed using Cox regression modeling. Setting: University Affiliated, Tertiary Care Center. Participants: Medical Students, Residents and Faculty. Results: About 98.6% of students (138 women, 140 men) used the MFS on their surgery clerkship. They requested feedback from 159 trainees (residents or fellows) and 114 surgical faculty. Feedback was requested more from faculty (26.3 requests per individual) compared to trainees (16.4 requests per individual). The overall evaluator response rate was 60%. Male students were 13% less likely to receive feedback than female students. There was a higher prevalence of feedback fatigue among female faculty (11% less likely to respond) and residents (23% less likely to respond). Regression analysis showed that the overall hazard of nonresponse over time was 1.05, indicative of overall feedback fatigue among all respondents. Conclusions: The MFS is a novel tool for feedback used by nearly all M3 students during their surgery clerkship at our institution. Evaluation of response rates demonstrated feedback fatigue, especially among women faculty and residents. Feedback fatigue was more likely to affect male students, although the reason for this is unclear. Further analysis is necessary to understand this sex-associated response disparity and its effect on student feedback in the learning environment.",2018-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Surgical Education,5200152837,5,75,The Effects of Feedback Fatigue and Sex Disparities in Medical Student Feedback Assessed Using a Minute Feedback System,0,false,10.1016/j.jsurg.2018.02.019,Elsevier Inc.usjcs@elsevier.com,806,,2018.0,69.0,1.0,,113383692,Alexandra S Weis,6822159,Liz Redford,36210882,A.

807,"© The Author(s) 2018.Many women eschew the feminist label despite believing in gender equality. In order to effectively promote feminist change, it is important to understand the factors involved in feminist attitudes, identification, and behavior. In the present research, we helped clarify the relations among these factors. In a survey of 428 U.S. women, we found that participants with stronger attitudes toward gender equality and more favorable explicit and implicit attitudes toward feminist prototypes were more likely to claim a feminist label. And those who did so reported greater willingness to intervene when confronted with everyday sexist behavior, particularly if they perceived that they personally were vulnerable to the effects of sexism. We suggest that improving attitudes toward feminist prototypes may help promote feminist identification, and informing women about the pervasiveness of sexism, including their personal vulnerability, may promote willingness to act after the feminist label has been adopted.

The reasons for these gender-differences in authorship is unclear. One potential reason is a bias in the editorial and review process of scientific journals. We investigated whether patterns of authorship and editorial outcome were biased according to gender and geographic location in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology. Such potential bias may contribute to inequality in the field. We found patterns of gender differences in authorship, but this was unrelated to the editorial decision of whether to publish the manuscript. Female first-authors (the lead role) were six times less likely to be named as the corresponding author than male first-authors, and female first-authors were more likely to be displaced as corresponding authors by female co-authors than were male first-authors. We found an under-representation of female first- and last-authors compared to baseline populations of members of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (which publishes the Journal of Evolutionary Biology) and of Evolutionary Biology faculty at the world top-10 universities for the Life Sciences. Also, manuscripts from Asia were five times more likely to be rejected on the final decision, independent of gender. Overall our results suggest that the peer review processes we investigated at the Journal of Evolutionary Biology are predominately gender-neutral, but not neutral to geographic location.

812,"© The Author(s) 2018.While it represents a common form of gender-based violence, misogyny is an often-overlooked concept within academia and the queer community. Drawing on queer and feminist scholarship on gay male misogyny, this article presents a theoretical challenge to the myth that the oppressed cannot oppress, arguing that specific forms of gay male subjectivities can be proponents of misogyny in ways that are unrecognised because of their sexually marginalised status. The authors’ interest in the doing of misogyny, and its effects on specific bodies and subjectivities, leads them to discuss the extent to which white gay male misogyny can function to reinforce a particular gender and racial hierarchy that continually confines queer femininities to the status of the abject other, for failing to exhibit their feminine credentials and for making gender trouble. The study also addresses how specific markers of femininity are depoliticised through the workings of this misogyny, exploring what femininity does when it is conceptualised outside a heteronormative framework. To address these ideas, the authors firstly propose a theoretical account of misogyny in order to understand its analytical status as a cultural mechanism within the psychic economy of patriarchy. Secondly, they use queer approaches to effeminacy and subject formation for making the case for gay male misogyny and its connections to femininity within white gay cultures, asking how misogyny might become an essential component of the performance of hegemonic masculinity. The article concludes with a discussion of the ways in which gay male misogyny reinforces white male dominance over women and queer femininities specifically, advocating for resistance to the reproduction of such patriarchal arrangements.",2018-08-01,Journal,Article,European Journal of Women's Studies,23134,16,25,Acceptable femininity?

813,"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Although the number of U.S. female professors has risen steadily in recent years, female professors are still subject to different student expectations and treatment. Students continue to perceive and expect female professors to be more nurturing than male professors are. We examined whether students may consequently request more special favors from female professors. In a survey of professors (n = 88) across the United States, Study 1 found that female (versus male) professors reported getting more requests for standard work demands, special favors, and friendship behaviors, with the latter two mediating the professor gender effect on professors’ self-reported emotional labor. Study 2 utilized an experimental design using a fictitious female or male professor, with college student participants (n = 121) responding to a scenario in which a special favor request might be made of the professor. The results indicated that academically entitled students (i.e., those who feel deserving of success in college regardless of effort/performance) had stronger expectations that a female (versus male) professor would grant their special favor requests.

814,"© 2017 Elsevier España, S.L.U.Aim: To explore the association between gender-role attitudes and the recognition of abuse among adolescents and young adults during dating relationships. Design: Cross-correlation study. Location: 57 schools of secondary education, vocational education and university in five provinces of Spain (Huelva, Seville, A Coruña, Pontevedra and Asturias). Participants: 4,337 students aged between 15 and 26 years (40.6% males and 59.4% female) who had a dating relationship that lasted more than a month. Main measurements: The Gender Role Attitudes Scale was used, which consists of 20 indicators of egalitarian or sexism attitudes at the family, social and occupational level. The students also reported whether they suffered from recognized abuse (RA), unperceived abuse (UPA), or not abused (NA). Results: In the whole sample, 68.6% declared themselves NA, 26.4% were under a situation of UPA, and 5.0% were RA. The RA group was more frequent among the females (6.3%), ≥ 18 years (6.4%) and university students (6.9%). UPA was more common in males (30.2%). The most sexist attitudes were found in the occupational dimension and especially in men and adolescents (15-17 years). Less sexist attitudes were associated with a lower probability of experiencing UPA (odds ratio =.71; P-trend <.001). Conclusions: Sexism seems to hinder the recognition of abuse. Achieving gender equity in adolescence and youth is imperative. Public health efforts should focus on men, as they constitute the group with more sexist attitudes and with higher prevalence of UPA.",2018-08-01,Journal,Article,Atencion Primaria,28018,31,50,Sexist attitudes and recognition of abuse in young couples Actitudes sexistas y reconocimiento del maltrato en parejas jóvenes,1,true,10.1016/j.aprim.2017.04.001,Elsevier Doyma,814,Nature,2018.0,9.0,10.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Computer scientists must identify sources of bias, de-bias training data and develop artificial-intelligence algorithms that are robust to skews in the data, argue James Zou and Londa Schiebinger.'}",2111395701,James Zou,5336339,L.

Readers responded enthusiastically, and by 2016 they had posted 70 million comments on the site. However, from the outset many journalists complained about the quality and tone of comments. Female and BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) journalists in particular complained that they were subject to more abuse than their male, white counterparts. This study finds prima facie evidence to support the journalists’ claims. Using comments that had been blocked by moderators as a proxy for abuse and dismissive trolling, it was found that articles written by women did attract a higher percentage of blocked comments than those written by men, regardless of the subject of the article; this effect was heightened when the articles ran in a particularly male-dominated section of the site. There was also evidence that articles written by BAME writers attracted disproportionate levels of blocked comments, even though the research was not designed to reveal this. Preliminary research findings were published in the Guardian and readers were invited to comment on them. Guardian journalists’ experiences of comments were also surveyed.

A complex amalgam of ‘old’ and ‘new’ sexism is what I term ‘third generation bias.’ Using organizational ethnography, I gathered evidence of sexist attitudes in multiple forms, ranging from the crudest to the subtlest, which revealed the underlying and complex power dynamics in the workplace. I, therefore, made the case against assuming that because anti-sexual harassment policies are in place, crude sexist practices like overt sexual harassment are a thing of the past.

Previous findings from the United States support this contention, however only a small number of health outcomes have been explored. This study extends the range of health outcomes examined by using a cross-sectional, multilevel analysis to investigate whether measures of state-level gender inequity are predictors of men’s self-rated health. Data were derived primarily from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the full-case data set included 116,594 individuals nested within 50 states. Gender inequity was measured with nine variables: higher education, women’s reproductive rights, abortion provider access, elected office, management, business ownership, labour force participation, earnings and relative poverty. Covariates at the individual level were age, income, education, race/ethnicity, marital status and employment status. Covariates at the state level were income inequality and gross domestic product per capita. In fully adjusted models for all-age men the reproductive rights (OR 1.06 95% CI 1.01–1.11), abortion provider access (OR 1.11 95% CI 1.05–1.16) and earnings (OR 1.06 95% CI 1.02–1.12) measures all predicted an increased risk of men reporting poorer self-rated health for each 1 standard deviation increase in the gender inequity z-score. The most consistent effect was seen for the 65+ age group where the reproductive rights (OR 1.09 95% CI 1.03–1.16), abortion provider access (OR 1.15 95% CI 1.09–1.21), elected office (OR 1.06 95% CI 1.01–1.11) and earnings (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.04–1.16) measures all showed a significant effect.

This study aims to understanding the prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their risk factors amongst female sex worker (FSWs) in Soweto, South Africa. Methods A cross-sectional, respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey enrolled 508 FSWs. Raw and RDS adjusted data were analyzed using a chi-squared test of association and multinomial regression for risk factors associated with depression and PTSD. Findings Symptoms of severe depression were prevalent amongst 68.7%, PTSD was 39.6%, and 32.7% suffered from comorbid PTSD and depression. Experiencing 3 kinds of violence increased the likelihood of comorbidity (RRR4.11, 95% CI 1.52–11.12,p = 0.005). Internalised stigma increased the likelihood of one mental health condition (RRR1.25, 95% CI 1.10–1.42,p = 0.001), higher self-esteem was associated with independent (RRR1.14, 95% CI 1.05–1.25,p = 0.002) and comorbid conditions (RRR1.17, 95% CI 1.07–1.27,p = 0.001). Conclusion Our findings highlight the sizable burden of treatable mental health conditions among FSWs in Soweto.

It also examines how Ambivalent Sexism and Rape Myth Acceptance impact on this. Background: Around one in five women will be victims of sexual assault during their lifetime. The majority are acquaintance rapes, and these victims are generally attributed more blame than victims of stranger rape. Research indicates that nurses hold similar attitudes on gender roles and victim blame as do the general public. Methods: Eighty-one participants read a story depicting a sexual assault of a woman by either a stranger or an acquaintance and completed scales measuring victim blame, Ambivalent Sexism and Rape Myth Acceptance. Results: The results of this study indicated that victim–perpetrator relationship, Benevolent Sexism, Hostile Sexism and whether the participant was a nurse contributed to the variance in attributed victim blame. Hierarchical regressions revealed that whether or not the participant was a nurse contributed to the variance in victim blame in the acquaintance rape condition, and Hostile Sexism and Benevolent Sexism contributed to the variance in victim blame in the stranger rape condition. Conclusions: This paper gives a novel insight into attitudes involved in victim blame in rape cases and makes a unique comparison between nurses and the general public. Findings suggest that victim blame correlates primarily with aggressively sexist attitudes and that nurses generally attribute more blame to the victim of acquaintance rape.

Building on interview data drawn from an ethnographic study, the article shows how the professionals’ articulations reflected a gender binary that framed how the feminized patients were often connected to psychiatric care while masculinized patients were referred to separate alcohol or substance use treatment outside the psychiatric institution. The article discusses the societal and institutional conditionality of gendered understandings in psychiatry.

829,"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Within Western cultures, most women in heterosexual relationships adopt their husbands’ surnames after marriage. In attempting to explain the enduring nature of this practice, researchers have noted that women tend to encounter stereotypes when they break with tradition by retaining their own surnames after marriage. A complementary possibility is that stereotypes are also directed toward men whose wives violate the surname tradition. The current research provides initial insight into this possibility through three studies that were conducted in the United States and United Kingdom with undergraduate and community samples (total N = 355; 254 women and 101 men). Study 1 revealed that participants predominantly referenced expressive traits when describing a man whose wife retained her surname. Study 2 built on these findings with an experimental design. Relative to a man whose wife adhered to the surname tradition, a man whose wife retained her surname was rated as less instrumental, more expressive, and as holding less power in the relationship. In Study 3, participants high in hostile sexism were particularly likely to rate a man as lower in power when his wife retained her surname. Collectively, findings provide insight into attitudes that may help to explain the longevity of the marital surname tradition. Findings also join with prior research in revealing links between commonplace marriage traditions and gendered power dynamics.",2018-07-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,6,79,Does a Woman’s Marital Surname Choice Influence Perceptions of Her Husband?

Predictors of female sexual dysfunction are multifaceted and vary from country to country. A synthesis of potential risk factors and protective factors may aid healthcare practitioners in identifying populations at risk, in addition to revealing modifiable factors to prevent sexual dysfunction among reproductive-age women. Methods: Observational studies which assessed the prevalence and predictors of female sexual dysfunction in reproductive-age women were systematically sought in relevant databases (2000-2014). Significant predictors were extracted from each included publication. A qualitative analysis of predictors was performed with a focus on types of sexual regimes and level of human development. Results: One hundred thirty-five studies from 41 countries were included in the systematic review. The types of predictors varied according to the location of the study, the type of sexual regime and the level of gender inequality in that country/region. Consistently significant risk factors of female sexual dysfunction were: poor physical health, poor mental health, stress, abortion, genitourinary problems, female genital mutilation, relationship dissatisfaction, sexual abuse, and being religious. Consistently significant protective factors included: older age at marriage, exercising, daily affection, intimate communication, having a positive body image, and sex education. Some factors however had an unclear effect: age, education, employment, parity, being in a relationship, frequency of sexual intercourse, race, alcohol consumption, smoking and masturbation. Conclusions: The sexual and reproductive lives of women are highly impacted by female sexual dysfunction, and a number of biological, psychological and social factors play a role in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction. Healthcare professionals who work with women should be aware of the many risk factors for reproductive-age women. Future prevention strategies should aim to address modifiable factors, e.g. physical activity and access to sex education; international efforts in empowering women should continue.",2018-06-22,Journal,Article,BMC Women's Health,19499,91,18,Predictors of female sexual dysfunction: A systematic review and qualitative analysis through gender inequality paradigms,1,true,10.1186/s12905-018-0602-4,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,830,Aesthetic surgery journal,2018.0,22.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Embedded in ethical and legal controversy, metrics of demand and numbers of procedures performed in North America are largely unknown, and surgeons are encouraged to become familiar with the ethical landscape surrounding these issues and are advised to consult the legal statutes or professional regulatory bodies in their area of practice should there be any concerns for a legislative barrier to providing this procedure.'}",26578011,M.

832,"© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that a woman would replace Hamilton on the $10 bill. In April 2016, it announced that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, instead. After each announcement, we surveyed nationally representative samples of American adults and asked them what they thought of these proposed changes for the $10 bill (Study 1, N = 209) and the $20 bill (Study 2, N = 208). Predictors of currency preferences were gender, race, political affiliation and their respective prejudices and biases—sexism, racism, and political ideology. On the basis of social identity, system justification, and social dominance theories we predicted that privileged groups (i.e., males, Whites) and groups who desire to maintain the status quo (i.e., Republicans, conservatives, sexist and racist individuals) would prefer to leave Hamilton on the $10 bill and Jackson on the $20 bill. Results were consistent with these predictions: Overall, we found that under-represented groups and more liberal individuals support the proposals from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licenseBackground: Excess female mortality causes half of the missing women (estimated deficit of women in countries with suspiciously low proportion of females in their population) today. Globally, most of these avoidable deaths of women occur during childhood in China and India. We aimed to estimate excess female under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) for India's 35 states and union territories and 640 districts. Methods: Using the summary birth history method (or Brass method), we derived district-level estimates of U5MR by sex from 2011 census data. We used data from 46 countries with no evidence of gender bias for mortality to estimate the effects and intensity of excess female mortality at district level. We used a detailed spatial and statistical analysis to highlight the correlates of excess mortality at district level. Findings: Excess female U5MR was 18·5 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 13·1–22·6) in India 2000–2005, which corresponds to an estimated 239 000 excess deaths (169 000–293 000) per year. More than 90% of districts had excess female mortality, but the four largest states in northern India (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh) accounted for two-thirds of India's total number. Low economic development, gender inequity, and high fertility were the main predictors of excess female mortality. Spatial analysis confirmed the strong spatial clustering of postnatal discrimination against girls in India. Interpretation: The considerable effect of gender bias on mortality in India highlights the need for more proactive engagement with the issue of postnatal sex discrimination and a focus on the northern districts. Notably, these regions are not the same as those most affected by skewed sex ratio at birth.

In response, the scientific community has called for methods to reduce bias, but few validated interventions exist. Thus, an interdisciplinary group of researchers and filmmakers partnered to create VIDS (Video Interventions for Diversity in STEM), which are short videos that expose participants to empirical findings from published gender bias research in 1 of 3 conditions. One condition illustrated findings using narratives (compelling stories), and the second condition presented the same results using expert interviews (straightforward facts). A hybrid condition included both narrative and expert interview videos. Results of two experiments revealed that relative to controls, VIDS successfully reduced gender bias and increased awareness of gender bias, positive attitudes toward women in STEM, anger, empathy, and intentions to engage in behaviors that promote gender parity in STEM. The narratives were particularly impactful for emotions, while the expert interviews most strongly impacted awareness and attitudes. The hybrid condition reflected the strengths of both the narratives and expert interviews (though effects were sometimes slightly weaker than the other conditions).

836,"© 2018 American Psychological Association.Organizations are increasingly concerned with fostering successful diversity. Toward this end, diversity research has focused on trying to reduce prejudice and biased behavior. But what happens when prejudice in the workplace inevitably occurs? Research also needs to focus on whether recovery and repair of social relations after expressions of prejudice are possible. To begin investigating this question, we develop a new framework for understanding reactions to prejudice in the workplace. We hypothesized that when women and minorities choose to confront a prejudiced comment in a workplace interaction (vs. remain silent) and hold a growth (vs. fixed) mindset-the belief that others can change-they remain more positive in their subsequent outlook in the workplace. Studies 1a, 1b, and 2 used hypothetical workplace scenarios to expose participants to someone who expressed bias; Study 3 ensured real-world relevance by eliciting retrospective accounts of workplace bias from African American employees. Across studies, women and minorities who confronted the perpetrator of prejudice exhibited more positive subsequent expectations of that coworker when they held a growth mindset. It is important that these more positive expectations were associated with reports of greater workplace belonging (Study 2), ratings of improved relations with coworkers who had displayed bias (Study 3), and greater workplace satisfaction (Studies 2-3). Thus, a growth mindset contributes to successful workplace diversity by protecting women's and minorities' outlook when they opt to confront expressions of bias.",2018-06-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Applied Psychology,15388,32,103,What happens after prejudice is confronted in the workplace?

Objectives: The aim of this critical analysis is to apply a feminist philosophy of science to examine the origins of the framework of telescoping research and its implications for contemporary scientific inquiry. Methods: A feminist philosophy of science framework is outlined and applied to key source publications of telescoping literature drawn from international and United States-based peer-reviewed journals published beginning in 1952. Results: A feminist philosophy of science framework identifies gender bias in telescoping research in three ways. First, gender bias was present in the early conventions that laid the groundwork for telescoping research. Second, a “masculine” framework was present in the methodology guiding telescoping research. Third, gender bias was present in the interpretation of results as evidenced by biased comparative language. Conclusions: Telescoping research contributed to early evidence of critical sex and gender differences helping to usher in women's substance abuse research more broadly. However, it also utilized a “masculine” framework that perpetuated gender bias and limited generative, novel research that can arise from women-focused research and practice.

Using an inductive mixed methods approach, two studies were conducted in a French context. In Study 1, 24 participants were asked to express their views about a vignette describing an IPV case during semi-structured interviews. In Study 2, 123 participants completed a questionnaire which was based on the results of Study 1. They were asked to evaluate the severity and justification for this same IPV case in relation to several situations identified in interviews. They also completed two scales measuring adherence to ideologies legitimizing male dominance: the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and the Domestic Violence Myth Acceptance Scale. Results show expressed ambivalence by participants between condemnation of IPV and the use of conditional logics in order to minimize or justify it. The expression of this reasoning was determined by social regulations such as the situations in which the violence occurred and adherence to legitimizing ideologies. Our results are relevant for campaigns raising awareness and educational programs that take into account social representations underlying IPV legitimization.",2018-05-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,18,78,“One Doesn’t Slap a Girl but…” Social Representations and Conditional Logics in Legitimization of Intimate Partner Violence,0,false,10.1007/s11199-017-0821-4,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,846,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2017.0,66.0,76.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States is developed.'}",2779427,Nikhil Garg,5336339,L.

In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts—e.g., the women’s movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States—and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time.

848,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: Fairness is a critical component of defensible assessment. Candidates should perform according to ability without influence from background characteristics such as ethnicity or sex. However, performance differs by candidate background in many assessment environments. Many potential causes of such differences exist, and examinations must be routinely analysed to ensure they do not present inappropriate progression barriers for any candidate group. By analysing the individual questions of an examination through techniques such as Differential Item Functioning (DIF), we can test whether a subset of unfair questions explains group-level differences. Such items can then be revised or removed. Methods: We used DIF to investigate fairness for 13,694 candidates sitting a major international summative postgraduate examination in internal medicine. We compared (a) ethnically white UK graduates against ethnically non-white UK graduates and (b) male UK graduates against female UK graduates. DIF was used to test 2773 questions across 14 sittings. Results: Across 2773 questions eight (0.29%) showed notable DIF after correcting for multiple comparisons: Seven medium effects and one large effect. Blinded analysis of these questions by a panel of clinician assessors identified no plausible explanations for the differences. These questions were removed from the question bank and we present them here to share knowledge of questions with DIF. These questions did not significantly impact the overall performance of the cohort. Group-level differences in performance between the groups we studied in this examination cannot be explained by a subset of unfair questions. Conclusions: DIF helps explore fairness in assessment at the question level. This is especially important in high-stakes assessment where a small number of unfair questions may adversely impact the passing rates of some groups. However, very few questions exhibited notable DIF so differences in passing rates for the groups we studied cannot be explained by unfairness at the question level.",2018-04-03,Journal,Article,BMC Medical Education,28099,12,18,Using differential item functioning to evaluate potential bias in a high stakes postgraduate knowledge based assessment,1,true,10.1186/s12909-018-1143-0,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,848,,2018.0,47.0,0.0,,117356804,A.

There is, however, no evidence that the public considers these ads sexist or is affected by them. To determine whether ads promote sexism even if the content is not identified as sexist, participants were exposed to ads containing no sexism, overt sexism, or latent sexism (i.e., content considered sexist by media experts, but not identified as sexist by a lay sample) and then read two vignettes describing incidents of sexual assault and sexual coercion. Participants exposed to ads with latent sexism showed greater acceptance of the sexual assault than did those in the no sexism ad condition and in the overt sexism ad condition. Regarding the sexual coercion vignette, latent sexism did not have the same effects; instead, participants exposed to ads with overt sexism were less likely to minimize the seriousness of the incident than participants in the other ad conditions. Therefore, acceptance of sexual assault can be increased by sexist content in ads even if the content is not identified as sexist.

Little is known about the relationship between gender-based discrimination (GBD) and URAI with stable partners among transgender women. Methods This mixed-methods research began with a cross-sectional survey conducted between 2014 and 2016 with transgender women in Salvador, the capital city in one of the poorest regions in Brazil. Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit the study population. GBD was defined through Latent Class Analysis. Additionally, 19 semi-structured interviews with participants were transcribed and analyzed through thematic content analysis. Results URAI with stable partners was commonly reported (37.3%). GDB was positively associated with URAI among stable partners (OR = 6.47; IC 95%: 1.67–25.02). The analysis of the interviews illustrated how GBD impacted transgender women in diverse ways. Experiences with GBD perpetrated by the family often initiated a trajectory of economic vulnerability that led many to engage in survival sex work. The constant experience with GBD contributed to participants feeling an immense sense of trust with their stable partners, ultimately diminished their desire to use condoms. Further, the high frequency of GBD contributed to poor mental health overall, though some participants said engagement in transgender advocacy efforts provided a vital source of resilience and support.",2018-04-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,17,13,Gender-based discrimination and unprotected receptive anal intercourse among transgender women in Brazil: A mixed methods study,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0194306,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,851,PLoS ONE,2018.0,36.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is found that indie publishing, though more egalitarian, largely replicates traditional publishing’s gender discrimination patterns, and price setting for work may be more similar for workers in the gig economy due to market competition that will compress prices ranges.'}",10163935,D.

In the last decade, the growth of digital technologies and sales platforms have enabled unprecedented numbers of authors to bypass publishers to publish and sell books. The rise of indie publishing (aka self-publishing) reflects the growth of the “gig” economy, where the influence of firms has diminished and workers are exposed more directly to external markets. Encompassing the traditional and the gig economy, the book industry illuminates how the gig economy may disrupt, replicate, or transform the gender discrimination mechanisms and inequality found in the traditional economy. In a natural experiment spanning from 2002 to 2012 and including over two million book titles, we compare discrimination mechanisms and inequality in indie and traditional publishing. We find that indie publishing, though more egalitarian, largely replicates traditional publishing’s gender discrimination patterns, showing an unequal distribution of male and female authors by genre (allocative discrimination), devaluation of genres written predominantly by female authors (valuative discrimination), and lower prices within genres for books by female authors (within-job discrimination). However, these discrimination mechanisms are associated with far less price inequality in indie, only 7%, in large part due to the smaller and lower range of prices in indie publishing compared to traditional publishing. We conclude that, with greater freedom, workers in the gig economy may be inclined to greater equality but will largely replicate existing labor market segmentation and the lower valuation of female-typical work and of female workers. Nonetheless, price setting for work may be more similar for workers in the gig economy due to market competition that will compress prices ranges.",2018-04-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,7,13,Comparing gender discrimination and inequality in indie and traditional publishing,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0195298,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,852,Qualitative Health Research,2018.0,66.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Focusing on the influence of social networks, the article extends research on “re-appropriation” of biomedicine by recognizing two competing tensions expressed through social interactions: suspicion of allopathic medicine and the desire to maximize one’s health.'}",6577505,P.

Benevolent sexism reveres women’s traditional caregiving roles and prescribes that men should cherish, protect, and provide for women. Benevolent sexism is appealing to both men and women because it promotes a gender role structure that promises intimacy and security within heterosexual relationships. However, benevolent sexism offers women relationship security at the expense of their career aspirations and accomplishments. The fundamental relationship motives that underpin this relationship-career trade-off for women present countervailing forces to policies designed to mitigate gender inequality. Thus, effective interventions must attend to the relationship processes that restrict women’s careers by valuing both career and relationship needs, promoting equity in career support and caregiving within intimate relationships, and providing early education to foster career and relationship goals that ensure both women and men thrive in both domains.",2018-03-01,Journal,Article,Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences,21100886228,12,5,How Intimate Relationships Contribute to Gender Inequality: Sexist Attitudes Encourage Women to Trade Off Career Success for Relationship Security,0,false,10.1177/2372732217745096,SAGE Publications Ltdinfo@sagepub.co.uk,858,Journal of African American Studies,2018.0,61.0,0.0,,66889465,Rouhollah Aghasaleh,,,,,,,,,,,172.0,5654.0,41.0,64.0,1172.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I argue that sexism, racism, homophobia, and classism in formal and hidden curriculum could be as mortal and brutal as it happened in cases of Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and others. Dress codes convey sexism with a male center gaze and racism with White middle-class norms that serve as a hidden curriculum with inherent biases. That is, not acting White, not being lady-like, wearing butch-tomboy or ragged clothing, is disruptive to academic success. Discussing a dress code in a high school in a working-class Black community, I argue that like police officers, educators tend to make dangerous judgments about bodies. Finally, to stop the harmful reproduction of such judgments, I suggest what Judith Butler calls “subversive repetition” and “subversive citation” (Butler 1990, p. 147) which allows resisting the everyday experiences that produce oneself to address the question that how can we, as teachers, school administrations, and teacher educators, resist those practices that produce our bodies as vulnerable and potential victims and others’ bodies as dangerous and potential violators. To problematize, to conceptualize, and to enhance the above-mentioned argument, I will draw on several feminist frameworks such as performativity (Butler 1990), intersectionality (Crenshaw 1989), and objectification (Fredrickson and Roberts 1997).",2018-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of African American Studies,9500154011,13,22,"Oppressive Curriculum: Sexist, Racist, Classist, and Homophobic Practice of Dress Codes in Schooling",0,false,10.1007/s12111-018-9397-5,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,859,,2017.0,70.0,2.0,,6198962,Sophie L.

861,"© 2018 The AuthorsBetween 2015 and 2016, Zika became an epidemic of global concern and the focus of intense media coverage. Using a hybrid model of frame and social representations theory, we examine how the Zika outbreak was reported in two major newspapers in Brazil: O Globo and Folha de São Paulo. The analysis of 186 articles published between December 2015 and May 2016 reveals a dominant ‘war’ frame supported by two sub-frames: one focused on eradicating the vector (mosquito) and another on controlling microcephaly, placing the burden of prevention on women. Scientific uncertainties about the virus and its relationship to microcephaly coupled with political uncertainties in Brazil increased the power of the war frame. This frame gave prominence and legitimacy to certain representations of disease management during the crisis, masking social and gender inequalities.

862,"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Across many disciplines, women are underrepresented in faculty positions relative to men. The present research focuses on the academic conference as a setting because it is a gateway to an academic career and a context in which women might experience sexism. We surveyed 329 presenters (63% women) from three U.S. national academic conferences, which differed in women-to-men ratios, about their perceptions of the conference climate, their coping tactics (e.g., gender performance, silence, or voice), and their intentions to exit the conference or academia. The greater the representation of women at the conference relative to men, the less likely were women to perceive sexism and to feel they had to behave in a masculine manner in that setting. In contrast, women who perceived the conference as sexist and felt silenced also expressed increased intentions to exit from academic careers. Men’s perceptions of sexism predicted increased intentions to exit from that particular conference, but not from academia. Because conferences signal the norms of a discipline, it is important to explore their climates as they relate to gender. Perhaps especially for new and aspiring female academics, they may signal devalued status and lack of fit and as such play an inadvertent role in the “leaky pipeline.” We discuss strategies that conference organizers could implement to mitigate sexist climates, including broader inclusion of women in speaking and leadership roles and explicit attention to cues that women belong.",2018-03-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,57,78,"The Academic Conference as a Chilly Climate for Women: Effects of Gender Representation on Experiences of Sexism, Coping Responses, and Career Intentions",0,false,10.1007/s11199-017-0800-9,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,862,,2018.0,32.0,0.0,,50877600,Oksana Yakushko,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,94.0,4.0,70.0,5900.0,32.0,142.0,7552.0,47.0,,,,,,,,,,Psychology

864,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdIn the United States, racial/ethnic inequalities in obesity are well-documented, particularly among women. Using the Chicago Community Adult Health Study, a probability-based sample in 2001–2003 (N = 3105), we examined the roles of discrimination and vigilance in racial inequalities in two weight-related measures, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), viewed through a cultural racism lens. Cultural racism creates a social environment in which Black Americans bear the stigma burden of their racial group while White Americans are allowed to view themselves as individuals. We propose that in this context, interpersonal discrimination holds a different meaning for Blacks and Whites, while vigilance captures the coping style for Blacks who carry the stigma burden of the racial group. By placing discrimination and vigilance within the context of cultural racism, we operationalize existing survey measures and utilize statistical models to clarify the ambiguous associations between discrimination and weight-related inequalities in the extant literature. Multivariate models were estimated for BMI and WC separately and were stratified by gender. Black women had higher mean BMI and WC than any other group, as well as highest levels of vigilance. White women did not show an association between vigilance and WC but did show a strong positive association between discrimination and WC. Conversely, Black women displayed an association between vigilance and WC, but not between discrimination and WC. These results demonstrate that vigilance and discrimination may hold different meanings for obesity by ethnoracial group that are concealed when all women are examined together and viewed without considering a cultural racism lens.",2018-02-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,63,199,The weight of racism: Vigilance and racial inequalities in weight-related measures,2,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.03.058,Elsevier Ltd,864,Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Most of the available studies on gender disparity in childhood are about endocrine and neuro-psychiatric disorders, while there are few data in other areas of medicine. Conclusions: Even if several studies on pediatric gender differences can be found on literature, few of them move forwards to analyze the reasons of the observed diversity.

885,"Copyright © 2018 by the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.Background: Potential sex bias has been shown in general surgery basic science and translational research, with unequal representation of male and female specimens. Because basic science research forms the foundation for clinical studies on which patient care is based, it is important that this research equally consider both sexes. The purpose of this study was to determine if potential sex bias exists in the basic science and translational orthopaedic literature. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of all articles published in 2014 in The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, The Bone & Joint Journal, and the Journal of Orthopaedic Research (JOR). All original research articles utilizing animals, cells, or cadavers were included. The data abstracted included study type, sex of specimen studied, and presence of sex-based reporting of data. A second review was performed of all basic science articles published in JOR in 1994, 2004, and 2014 to compare sex bias trends across 3 decades. Distributions of variables were compared using the Fisher exact test, with significance defined as p < 0.05. Results: Of 1,693 articles reviewed, 250 (15%) were included: 122 animal-based studies (49%), 71 cell-based studies (28%), and 57 human cadaver-based studies (23%). Overall, authors in 88 studies (35%) did not report the sex of animals, cells, or cadavers used. Of 162 studies in which the authors did report sex, 69 (43%) utilized male only, 40 (25%) utilized female only, and 53 (33%) utilized both sexes. Of those studies that used both sexes, authors in only 7 studies (13%) reported sex-based results. A subanalysis of JOR articles across 3 decades revealed a significant increase in studies specifying sex (p = 0.01) from 2004 to 2014.

The purpose of this study was to review literature on gendered norms about men and women with pain and gender bias in the treatment of pain. The second aim was to analyze the results guided by the theoretical concepts of hegemonic masculinity and andronormativity. Methods. A literature search of databases was conducted. A total of 77 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles were analyzed qualitatively, with an integrative approach. Results. The included studies demonstrated a variety of gendered norms about men's and women's experience and expression of pain, their identity, lifestyle, and coping style. Gender bias in pain treatment was identified, as part of the patient-provider encounter and the professional's treatment decisions. It was discussed how gendered norms are consolidated by hegemonic masculinity and andronormativity. Conclusions.

The aim of this study was to assess HRQoL inequalities between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people and heterosexuals in the 2011 Barcelona population, to describe the extent to which sociodemographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, and chronic conditions could explain such inequalities, and to understand if they are sexual orientation inequities. Methods In the 2011 Barcelona Health Interview Survey 3277 adults answered the EQ-5D, which measures five dimensions of HRQoL summarized into a single utility index (1 = perfect health, 0 = death). To assess HRQoL differences by sexual orientation we constructed Tobit models for the EQ-5D index, and Poisson regression models for the EQ-5D dimensions. In both cases, nested models were constructed to assess the mediator role of selected variables. Results After adjusting by socio-demographic variables, the LGB group presented a significantly lower EQ-5D index than heterosexuals, and higher prevalence ratios of problems in physical EQ-5D dimensions among both genders: adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 1.70 for mobility (p = 0.046) and 2.11 for usual activities (p = 0.019). Differences in mental dimensions were only observed among men: aPR = 3.15 for pain/discomfort (p = 0.003) and 2.49 for anxiety/ depression (p = 0.030). All these differences by sexual orientation disappeared after adding chronic conditions and health-related behaviors in the models. Conclusion The LGB population presented worse HRQoL than heterosexuals in the EQ-5D index and most dimensions. Chronic conditions, health-related behaviors and gender play a major role in explaining HRQoL differences by sexual orientation. These findings support the need of including sexual orientation into the global agenda of health inequities.",2018-01-01,Journal,Review,PLoS ONE,10600153309,13,13,Health-related quality of life inequalities by sexual orientation: Results from the Barcelona Health Interview Survey,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0191334,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,888,American Journal of Neuroradiology,2018.0,39.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Issues such as mentoring, role models, opportunities to engage in leadership/research activities, funding opportunities, and mindfulness regarding research productivity are explored.'}",152712396,M.

889,"Background and Purpose: There has been extensive interest in promoting gender equality within radiology, a predominately male field. In this study, our aim was to quantify gender representation in neuroradiology faculty rankings and determine any related factors that may contribute to any such disparity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the academic and administrative faculty members of neuroradiology divisions for all on-line listed programs in the US and Canada. After excluding programs that did not fulfill our selection criteria, we generated a short list of 85 US and 8 Canadian programs. We found 465 faculty members who met the inclusion criteria for our study. We used Elsevier's SCOPUS for gathering the data pertaining to the publications, H-index, citations, and tenure of the productivity of each faculty member. RESULTS: Gender disparity was insignificant when analyzing academic ranks. There are more men working in neuroimaging relative to women (X 2 = 0.46; P = .79). However, gender disparity was highly significant for leadership positions in neuroradiology (X 2 = 6.76; P = .009). The median H-index was higher among male faculty members (17.5) versus female faculty members (9). Female faculty members have odds of 0.84 compared with male faculty members of having a higher H-index, adjusting for publications, citations, academic ranks, leadership ranks, and interaction between gender and publications and gender and citations (9).

Using a national, community-based sample of 255 men, the present study examined the moderating effects of ambivalent sexism (i.e., hostile and benevolent sexism) on the relationship between alcohol use and IPV perpetration.

895,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.Whereas confrontations of racial bias prompt negative self-directed affect (e.g., guilt) and reduce bias, confrontations of gender bias are typically disregarded. We examined the effectiveness of an evidence-based confrontation in which participants received concrete evidence of their discriminatory gender-biased evaluations. Participants were confronted with evidence that they evaluated a female applicant for a lab manager position negatively, which would have resulted in her not being hired, and that their evaluations were more negative than an otherwise identical applicant who was male. Experiment 1 found that this confrontation activated greater guilt and, in turn, concern about expressing and regulating gender bias in the future (hereafter “future concern”), relative to participants who were confronted about gender bias but without concrete evidence of bias. Experiment 2 showed that confrontation with concrete evidence of gender bias activated guilt and future concern whether the bias was framed as viewing women as not belonging in science or as unintelligent. Experiment 3 showed that the positive effects of confronting gender bias with evidence were just as strong as a parallel confrontation of racial bias. Experiment 4 showed that the positive effects also held in a non-STEM domain, and that these effects were not dependent on the situational salience of norms opposing gender bias. Thus, a robust strategy for effective confrontation of gender bias was established.

896,"© 2016 American Psychological Association.Social psychologists have argued that popular U.K. and U.S. men's magazines known as ""lads' mags"" have normalized hostile sexism among young men. Three studies develop this argument. First, a survey of 423 young U.K. men found that ambivalent sexism predicted attitudes toward the consumption of lads' mags, but not other forms of direct sexual consumption (paying for sex or patronizing strip clubs). Second, Study 2 (N = 81) found that young men low in sexism rated sexist jokes as less hostile toward women, but not as either funnier nor more ironic, when those jokes were presented within a lads' mags context. These findings refute the idea that young men readily read lads' mags' sexism as ironic or ""harmless fun."" They show instead that placing sexist jokes in lads' mags contexts makes them appear less hostile. The third study (N = 275) demonstrated that young men perceived lads' mags as less legitimate after attempting to distinguish the contents of lads' mags from rapists' legitimations of their crimes.

The current research explored a number of factors and their impact upon stereotypical perceptions and attitudes toward female players. This included avatar gender, gender identity by gaming context, as well as more general gender-role beliefs. We undertook two studies, each utilizing an online questionnaire targeted toward online players. Study 1 recruited online gamers (N = 489) and compared competence perceptions of players, which varied by player gender (male, female) and avatar gender (male, female), whereby four conditions were established. Overall, player competence was perceived to be highest when male avatars were used, specifically when female players were depicted in this way. Study 2 explored the relationships between male social identity and gender-role beliefs, with sexist attitudes in gaming, and whether this varied by gaming context (massively multiplayer online [MMO] vs. first-person shooter [FPS]). Male online gamers (N = 193) were recruited, of which 112 were MMO players, and 81 were FPS players. It was found that identifying as male social identity was not related to sexist attitudes in either gaming context. However, more general gender-role beliefs were related to sexist attitudes.

Context: Very little population-based research has examined health and access to care among transgender populations. This study compared barriers to care between cisgender, transgender, and gender nonconforming (GNC) adults using data from a large, multistate sample. Methods: We used data from the 2014-2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate the prevalence of having no health insurance, unmet medical care needs due to cost, no routine checkup, and no usual source of care for cisgender women (n = 183,370), cisgender men (n = 131,080), transgender women (n = 724), transgender men (n = 449), and GNC adults (n = 270). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each barrier to care while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Findings: Transgender and GNC adults were more likely to be nonwhite, sexual minority, and socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to cisgender adults. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, transgender women were more likely to have no health insurance (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.07-2.40) compared to cisgender women; transgender men were more likely to have no health insurance (OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.25-3.25) and no usual source of care (OR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.18-2.88); and GNC adults were more likely to have unmet medical care needs due to cost (OR = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.02-3.67) and no routine checkup in the prior year (OR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.41-4.12). Conclusions: Transgender and GNC adults face barriers to health care that may be due to a variety of reasons, including discrimination in health care, health insurance policies, employment, and public policy or lack of awareness among health care providers on transgender-related health issues.",2017-12-01,Journal,Article,Milbank Quarterly,21103,124,95,Barriers to Care Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Adults,2,,10.1111/1468-0009.12297,Blackwell Publishing Inc.subscrip@blackwellpub.com,898,,2017.0,13.0,0.0,,8275806,P.

899,"© 2017 L'Encéphale, ParisPsychiatric experts find it is easier to deal with more horrible crimes than highly conflictual divorces. In the former, projections are impossible and “files” raise very interesting issues with regard to criminology; in contrast, in the latter the expert is confronted not just with a family but also and lest one forget, a couple that at one point in time had loved each other. However, the separation resembles a bloodbath. We will not detail the various psychiatric pathologies, which may further complicate a separation: they are well-known and, on a procedural level, do not raise any specific concerns. We will however address “pathological divorces” where although individuals, assessed on a case-by-case basis, are exempt from ascertainable or developing psychiatric pathologies, pathology permeates systemic relations, inextricably linked to hatred or disgust. In this light, fault-based divorces still remain rare: it is in this context, marked by defiance and doubt as to the parental competence of each member of the couple that the psychiatric expert intervenes, with a similar acknowledged mission to that of the court: recommendations to be offered regarding visitation and custody rights. Amongst the conflictual and inextricable situations the most often encountered in expert practice, the parental alienation syndrome (PAS) now known as parental alienation (PA) refers to all psychopathological manifestations observed in children subject to highly conflictual parental separations, and above all, the unjustified or inexplicable rejection of a parent by a child (or even by siblings). This recent entity has raised controversy: some even go so far as to deny the existence itself of this phenomenon claiming that it does not appear in the international classifications of psychiatric disorders. Consequently, it was not included in the last edition of the DSM and does not appear in the ICD classification of the OMS whose 11th edition is currently being prepared. The weaknesses in the scientific concept and its purely passionate dimension, including sexist controversies, must be carefully elucidated in the dismissal or denial of this pathology. The author raises various definitions of parental alienation of which the most recent is undoubtedly the least controversial. He discusses the reasons for the dismissal of the concept by the Scientific Committee of the DSM-5. This dismissal is however quite apparent as although the term “parental alienation” is not contained therein, we will show that the notion is clearly referred to in at least two chapters of the new American classification of mental disorders.",2017-12-01,Journal,Article,Encephale,15488,5,43,"Parental alienation, child psychological abuse and DSM-5 Aliénation parentale, abus psychologique de l'enfant et DSM-5",0,false,10.1016/j.encep.2017.08.003,Elsevier Masson SAS62 rue Camille DesmoulinsIssy les Moulineaux Cedex92442,899,,2017.0,63.0,1.0,,3395967,Michael Mudrick,30617180,L.

However, agentic women often face discrimination and backlash when seeking positions of power.

These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (Mage = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences.

These ergonomic studies advocated a participatory approach involving interviews and observations with high school teachers (thirty-five) and female teachers responsible for vocational training in trades with predominantly male clientele (twelve). The results revealed that gender influences work success by reducing the operational leeway available for female teachers to carry out their work and protect their health. In both studies, it was difficult to discuss these results with the teachers, especially with female teachers.

However, it is unknown whether self-criticism and dependency predict the first onset of depressive and anxiety disorders, and unclear how to characterize dynamic mechanisms by which these traits, stressful life events, and psychopathology influence one another over time. In this study, 550 female adolescents were assessed at baseline, 528 and 513 of whom were assessed again at Waves 2 and 3, respectively, over the course of 18 months. Self-criticism and dependency were assessed with self-report inventories, depressive and anxiety disorders were assessed with diagnostic interviews, and stressful life events were assessed via semistructured interview. Logistic regression analyses showed that self-criticism and dependency significantly predicted the first onset of nearly all depressive and anxiety disorders (significant polychoric rs ranged from .15-.42). Subsequent path analyses focused on prediction of depression, and supported several conceptual models of personality-stresspsychopathology relationships. In particular, Personality × Stress interactions were evident for both dependency and self-criticism.

908,"© 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.This research examined bias and accuracy in judging hostile and benevolent sexism during mixed-gender interactions. Bias is defined as underestimation or overestimation of a partner’s sexism. Accuracy is defined as covariation in two different ways, as (a) the strength of the association between a dyad member’s judgment and their partner’s sexism, across dyads, and (b) the ability to differentiate sexism between multiple targets. In Studies 1 and 2, members of mixed-gender dyads rated their own and their partners’ benevolent and hostile sexism. Overall, there was no covariation, across dyads, between perceptions and the partner’s self-reported sexism. However, women overestimated men’s hostile sexism; there was no evidence of biases for women judging men’s benevolent sexism. Men underestimated women’s hostile sexism and overestimated benevolent sexism. In Study 3, participants watched brief videos of male or female students (targets) from Study 1 and completed benevolent or hostile sexism items for each target as they thought the target would fill them out. Accuracy for detecting sexism across multiple targets (using sensitivity correlations) was significantly above chance for both forms of sexism. Male and female participants were more accurate at detecting hostile sexism in male targets than female targets. Participants were more accurate at detecting benevolent sexism of same-gender targets than opposite-gender targets.

The aim of the present study is to examine attitudes toward girl child marriages in Turkey within the perspective of social dominance theory (Sidanius and Pratto 1999). Namely, we investigate the relationship between social dominance orientation and attitudes toward girl child marriages.

Students (N = 388) from two universities in Ankara completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) Scale, and our Attitudes toward Girl Child Marriages Scale. Results indicate that men have more positive attitudes toward girl child marriages than women do. In addition, SDO predicts positive attitudes toward girl child marriages. Also, hostile, but not benevolent, sexism mediates the relationship between SDO and attitudes toward girl child marriages.

912,"© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is a rare, genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder. Patients suffer from recurrent infections caused by reduced levels or absence of serum immunoglobulins. Genetically, 4 subtypes of ICF syndrome have been identified to date: ICF1 (DNMT3B mutations), ICF2 (ZBTB24 mutations), ICF3 (CDCA7 mutations), and ICF4 (HELLS mutations). Aim: To study the mutation spectrum in ICF syndrome. Materials and methods: Genetic studies were performed in peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from suspected ICF patients and family members. Results: We describe 7 ICF1 patients and 6 novel missense mutations in DNMT3B, affecting highly conserved residues in the catalytic domain. We also describe 5 new ICF2 patients, one of them carrying a homozygous deletion of the complete ZBTB24 locus. In a meta-analysis of all published ICF cases, we observed a gender bias in ICF2 with 79% male patients. Discussion: The biallelic deletion of ZBTB24 provides strong support for the hypothesis that most ICF2 patients suffer from a ZBTB24 loss of function mechanism and confirms that complete absence of ZBTB24 is compatible with human life. This is in contrast to the observed early embryonic lethality in mice lacking functional Zbtb24. The observed gender bias seems to be restricted to ICF2 as it is not observed in the ICF1 cohort. Conclusion: Our study expands the mutation spectrum in ICF syndrome and supports that DNMT3B and ZBTB24 are the most common disease genes.",2017-10-01,Journal,Article,Clinical Genetics,22064,20,92,Expanding the mutation spectrum in ICF syndrome: Evidence for a gender bias in ICF2,0,false,10.1111/cge.12979,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,912,Sex Roles,2017.0,49.0,0.0,,30954060,Jennifer F.

In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight Black and Latina 16–19 year-old young women who identified as lesbian or bisexual. Using the Listening Guide method of narrative analysis, two voices pertaining to young women’s objectification experiences were identified: a Voice of Surveillance and a Voice of Self-Surveillance. Findings suggest that young women experienced sexual objectification as rooted in their gender, sexuality, and racial identities.

We examined associations of perceived discrimination measures with changes in kidney function in a prospective cohort study, the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span. Methods Our study included 1620 participants with preserved baseline kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [EGFR] ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) (662 whites and 958 African Americans, aged 30-64 years). Self-reported perceived racial discrimination and perceived gender discrimination (PGD) and a general measure of experience of discrimination (EOD) (""medium versus low,"" ""high versus low"") were examined in relation to baseline, follow-up, and annual rate of change in EGFR using multiple mixed-effects regression (γbase, γrate) and ordinary least square models (γfollow). Results Perceived gender discrimination ""high versus low PGD"" was associated with a lower baseline EGFR in all models (γbase =-3.51 (1.34), p =.009 for total sample). Among white women, high EOD was associated with lower baseline EGFR, an effect that was strengthened in the full model (γbase =-5.86 [2.52], p =.020). Overall, ""high versus low"" PGD was associated with lower follow-up EGFR (γfollow =-3.03 [1.45], p =.036). Among African American women, both perceived racial discrimination and PGD were linked to lower follow-up kidney function, an effect that was attenuated with covariate adjustment, indicating mediation through health-related, psychosocial, and lifestyle factors. In contrast, EOD was not linked to follow-up EGFR in any of the sex by race groups.

Those sharing cross-cultural patterns (sexism, ageism) each combine societal status differences and intimate interdependence.

Meta-analyses support these widespread ambivalent (mixed) stereotypes for gender and age across cultures. Social class stereotypes often share some similarities (cold but competent rich vs. warm but incompetent poor). These compensatory warmth versus competence stereotypes may function to manage common human dilemmas of interacting across societal and personal positions.

921,"© 2017People often disagree about what constitutes sexism, and these disagreements can be both socially and legally consequential. It is unclear, however, why or how people come to different conclusions about whether something or someone is sexist. Previous research on judgments about sexism has focused on the perceiver's gender and attitudes, but neither of these variables identifies comparative standards that people use to determine whether any given behavior (or person) is sexist. Extending Devine and colleagues’ values framework (Devine, Monteith, Zuwerink, & Elliot, 1991; Plant & Devine, 1998), we argue that, when evaluating others’ behavior, perceivers rely on the morally-prescriptive values that guide their own behavior toward women. In a series of 3 studies we demonstrate that (1) people's personal standards for sexism in their own and others’ behavior are each related to their values regarding sexism, (2) these values predict how much behavioral evidence people need to infer sexism, and (3) people with stringent, but not lenient, value-based standards get angry and try to regulate a sexist perpetrator's behavior to reduce sexism. Furthermore, these personal values are related to all outcomes in the present work above and beyond other person characteristics previously used to predict sexism inferences.

923,"© 2017 Family Process InstituteThe persistence of gender inequality in postindustrial societies is puzzling in light of a plethora of changes that destabilize it, including shifts in economy, legislation, and the proliferation of feminist politics. In family relations, such persistence manifests as a disconnect between couples aspiring to be more egalitarian yet continuing to enact traditional gender roles and hierarchies. There is an emerging consensus that gender inequality persists because of people's continued reliance on sexist ideology or gendered assumptions that constitute women as innately distinct from and inferior to men. Sexist ideology changes its form to accommodate to changing socio-economic conditions. Contemporary forms of sexism are old ways of legitimizing male power articulated in new and creative ways, often by incorporating feminist arguments. To effectively recognize and address “new sexism,” scholars and practitioners require new, innovative research frameworks. Our objective in writing this article is two-fold. First, we seek to advance discursive (i.e., focused on language in use) approaches to the study of sexism. Second, we present the results of a discursive analysis of “new” sexist discourse in the context of couple therapy.

931,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdObjectives We examined the association between socioeconomic status (SES) discrimination and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a biracial cohort of middle-aged adults using an intersectionality framework. Methods Participants were 401 African-American and White adults from a population-based cohort in the Southeastern United States. SES discrimination was self-reported with a modified Experiences of Discrimination Scale, and CRP levels were assayed from blood samples. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations among SES discrimination, race, education, and CRP after controlling for age, gender, racial and gender discrimination, financial and general stress, body mass index, smoking, sleep quality, and depressive symptoms. Intersectional effects were tested using race × SES discrimination, education × SES discrimination and race × education × SES discrimination interactions. Results Adjusting for sociodemographics, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and all relevant two-way interaction terms, we observed a significant race × education × SES discrimination interaction (p = 0.019). In adjusted models stratified by race and education, SES discrimination was associated with elevated CRP among higher educated African-Americans (β = 0.29, p = 0.018), but not lower educated African-Americans (β= −0.13, p = 0.32); or lower educated (β= −0.02, p = 0.92) or higher educated (β= −0.01, p = 0.90) Whites.

935,"© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.We examined how sexism related to gay and bisexual men’s preferences for same-sex top (dominant) or bottom (submissive) sexuality in China. Specifically, we determined the impacts of sexism on sexual self-label identification and requirements for a romantic partner’s sexual role among 507 Chinese gay and bisexual men. Sexism was found to significantly predict top/bottom sexual self-label: gay and bisexual men endorsing benevolent sexism (BS; ideation of women who conform to traditional gender roles) were more likely to identify as tops than as bottoms. We also noted a significant prediction of hostile sexism (HS; hostility toward women who oppose traditional roles) on partner choice: Tops and bottoms endorsing HS were more likely to require a complementary partner rather than to have no requirements. Moreover, sexism was related to sexual role prejudice, a concept derived from sexism that we defined as holding attitudes toward the gender roles of “bottoms” among gay and bisexual men that indicate inequality of sexual self-labels. In a mediation analysis of these relationships, we noted significant indirect effects of BS and HS on sexual self-label via both benevolent and hostile sexual role prejudice, as well as on requirements for a romantic partner’s sexual role via benevolent (but not hostile) sexual role prejudice.

936,"Background Preventive and curative medical interventions can reduce child mortality. It is important to assess whether there is gender bias in access to these interventions, which can lead to preferential treatment of children of a given sex. Methods Data from Demographic and Health Surveys carried out in 57 low- and middle-income countries were used. The outcome variable was a composite careseeking indicator, which represents the proportion of children with common childhood symptoms or illnesses (diarrhea, fever, or suspected pneumonia) who were taken to an appropriate provider. Results were stratified by sex at the national level and within each wealth quintile. Ecological analyses were carried out to assess if sex ratios varied by world region, religion, national income and its distribution, and gender inequality indices. Linear multilevel regression models were used to estimate time trends in careseeking by sex between 1994 and 2014. Findings Eight out of 57 countries showed significant differences in careseeking; in six countries, girls were less likely to receive care (Colombia, Egypt, India, Liberia, Senegal and Yemen). Seven countries had significant interactions between sex and wealth quintile, but the patterns varied from country to country. In the ecological analyses, lower careseeking for girls tended to be more common in countries with higher income concentration (P = 0.039) and higher Muslim population (P = 0.006). Coverage increased for both sexes; 0.95 percent points (pp) a year among girls (32.9% to 51.9%), and 0.91 pp (34.8% to 52.9%) among boys. Conclusion The overall frequency of careseeking is similar for girls and boys, but not in all countries, where there is evidence of gender bias. A gender perspective should be an integral part of monitoring, accountability and programming.

The psychiatrists found the non-conformist defendants to be of unsound mind. On the other hand, women and men who did conform to the gender stereotypes were also described. In those cases, however, “feminine” women were certified insane, whereas “masculine” men were accused of simulating a mental disease in order to avoid punishment.

In the first study, participants read a fictitious newspaper article describing an IPV incident.

Participants judged both the victim's moral patiency and morality, and then expressed their willingness to provide help to that victim. Although the sexualized victim was viewed as a lesser moral patient (Studies 1 and 2) and as less moral (Study 2), it was seeing the victim as unworthy of moral patiency rather than lacking moral virtue (immoral) that linked sexualization to reduced help.

Continuing to probe text mining as a tool to identify gender bias in peer review, we used algorithmic text mining and qualitative analysis to examine a sample of critiques from men's and women's R01 renewal applications previously analyzed by counting and comparing word categories. Methods: We analyzed 241 critiques from 79 Summary Statements for 51 R01 renewals awarded to 45 investigators (64% male, 89% white, 80% PhD) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2010 and 2014. We used latent Dirichlet allocation to discover evaluative ""topics"" (i.e., words that co-occur with high probability). We then qualitatively examined the context in which evaluative words occurred for male and female investigators. We also examined sex differences in assigned scores controlling for investigator productivity. Results: Text analysis results showed that male investigators were described as ""leaders"" and ""pioneers"" in their ""fields,"" with ""highly innovative"" and ""highly significant research."" By comparison, female investigators were characterized as having ""expertise"" and working in ""excellent"" environments. Applications from men received significantly better priority, approach, and significance scores, which could not be accounted for by differences in productivity. Conclusions: Results confirm our previous analyses suggesting that gender stereotypes operate in R01 grant peer review. Reviewers may more easily view male than female investigators as scientific leaders with significant and innovative research, and score their applications more competitively.

This study explores the climate for women faculty from a systems perspective at the organizational and individual levels based on the perceptions of women faculty. Race differences were also investigated. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional survey data from women faculty (N = 3127) at 13 purposively sampled medical schools and an institutional assessment of organizational characteristics were used. Organizational factors related to the climate for women were identified using bivariate statistics. The association between perceived climate for women and organizational characteristics, individual perceptions of the work environment and individual career, and personal characteristics with control variables were investigated using hierarchical linear regression models. Organizational effects by race/ethnicity were estimated using interaction terms. Results: The climate for women faculty varied across institutions and by classification as minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Respondent's report of existence of an office for women's affairs, trust in leadership, and satisfaction with mentoring were positively associated with the climate for women. Perceived workplace discrimination and work-family conflict were inversely associated with a positive climate. No race/ethnicity differences were observed in the multivariable analysis. Conclusions: The climate for women faculty in academic medicine should not be regarded constant across organizations, specifically between MSIs and non-MSIs.

946,"© 2016 British Association of DermatologistsBackground: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is an indolent cutaneous lymphoma with excellent prognosis at early stages and much poorer outcome during disease progression. Old age, male sex and folliculotropism have been proposed as relevant prognostic factors; however, their exact effect remains debatable. Objectives: To evaluate MF prognostic indicators and survival rates in a Greek population. Methods: Prognostic variables affecting survival rates were studied in 473 patients with MF diagnosed and treated by two academic referral centres in Greece. Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to determine survival rates and progression. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess prognostic factors. Results: The mean age of diagnosis was 61·7 years (SD 16·33). Five-year disease-specific survival was 96% in patients with stage IA disease and 52% in patients with stage IIB disease. Univariate analysis certified that large-cell transformation, clonal rearrangements of the TCR gene, severe pruritus and presence of plaques were the most important prognostic factors. Folliculotropism altered disease progression only in patients with early-stage disease. The application of the Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (CLIPI) on our late-stage group failed to provide reliable evidence. The current Cutaneous Lymphoma International Consortium (CLIC) prognostic index can efficiently distinguish a low-risk from a high-risk group of patients. Tumour–Node–Metastasis–Blood (TNMB) staging was the most important prognostic factor for survival rates in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: In our study we validated the current prognostic indicators for MF in a Greek population and identified new potential prognostic factors for survival outcome.

947,"© 2016 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Diagnostic bias is a concern in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) where prevalence and presentation differ by sex. To ensure that females with ASC are not under-identified, it is important that ASC screening tools do not systematically underestimate autistic traits in females relative to males. We evaluated whether the AQ-10, a brief screen for ASC recommended by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in cases of suspected ASC, exhibits such a bias. Using an item response theory approach, we evaluated differential item functioning and differential test functioning. We found that although individual items showed some sex bias, these biases at times favored males and at other times favored females. Thus, at the level of test scores the item-level biases cancelled out to give an unbiased overall score. Results support the continued use of the AQ-10 sum score in its current form; however, suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting responses to individual items. The nature of the item level biases could serve as a guide for future research into how ASC affects males and females differently.

950,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdBackground Important inequalities in childhood vaccination coverage persist between countries and population groups. Understanding why some countries achieve higher and more equitable levels of coverage is crucial to redress these inequalities. In this study, we explored the country-level determinants of (1) coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis- (DTP3) containing vaccine and (2) within-country inequalities in DTP3 coverage in 45 countries supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Methods We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2005 and 2014. We measured national DTP3 coverage and the slope index of inequality in DTP3 coverage with respect to household wealth, maternal education, and multidimensional poverty. We collated data on country health systems, health financing, governance and geographic and sociocultural contexts from published sources. We used meta-regressions to assess the relationship between these country-level factors and variations in DTP3 coverage and inequalities. To validate our findings, we repeated these analyses for coverage with measles-containing vaccine (MCV). Results We found considerable heterogeneity in DTP3 coverage and in the magnitude of inequalities across countries. Results for MCV were consistent with those from DTP3. Political stability, gender equality and smaller land surface were important predictors of higher and more equitable levels of DTP3 coverage. Inequalities in DTP3 coverage were also lower in countries receiving more external resources for health, with lower rates of out-of-pocket spending and with higher national coverage. Greater government spending on heath and lower linguistic fractionalization were also consistent with better vaccination outcomes.

951,"© 2017 the authors.There is significant controversy over the existence and function of a direct subcortical visual pathway to the amygdala. It is thought that this pathway rapidly transmits low spatial frequency information to the amygdala independently of the cortex, and yet the directionality of this function has never been determined. We used magnetoencephalography to measure neural activity while human participants discriminated the gender of neutral and fearful faces filtered for low or high spatial frequencies. We applied dynamic causal modeling to demonstrate that the most likely underlying neural network consisted of a pulvinar-amygdala connection that was uninfluenced by spatial frequency or emotion, and a cortical-amygdala connection that conveyed high spatial frequencies. Crucially, data-driven neural simulations revealed a clear temporal advantage of the subcortical connection over the cortical connection in influencing amygdala activity. Thus, our findings support the existence of a rapid subcortical pathway that is nonselective in terms of the spatial frequency or emotional content of faces. We propose that that the “coarseness” of the subcortical route may be better reframed as “generalized."".",2017-04-05,Journal,Article,Journal of Neuroscience,16764,63,37,A rapid subcortical amygdala route for faces irrespective of spatial frequency and emotion,1,true,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3525-16.2017,Society for Neuroscience,951,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,2017.0,54.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Although female participation in substance use studies of brain morphometry has increased, sex disparity persists, and Studying adequate numbers of both sexes and employing correct analytic approaches is critical for understanding sex differences in brain morphometric changes in substance abuse.'}",3905159,K.

The NIH has supported the need for research to address sex differences. We evaluated female enrollment in substance abuse structural brain imaging research and the methods used to study sex differences in substance effects. Methods Structural brain imaging studies published through 2016 (n = 230) were evaluated for number of participants by sex and substance use status and methods used to evaluate sex differences. Temporal trends in the numbers of participants by sex and substance use status were analyzed. We evaluated how often sex effects were appropriately analyzed and the proportion of studies that found sex by substance interactions on volumetric measures. Results Female enrollment increased over time, but remained significantly lower than male enrollment (p = 0.01), with the greatest bias for alcohol and opiate studies. 79% of studies included both sexes; however, 74% did not evaluate sex effects or used an analytic approach that precluded detection of sex by substance use interactions. 85% of studies that stratified by sex reported different substance effects on brain volumes. Only 33% of studies examining two-way interactions found significant interactions, highlighting that many studies were underpowered to detect interactions.

However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped.

955,"© 2016 John Wiley & Sons LtdEven though breastfeeding is typically considered the preferred feeding method for infants worldwide, in Belgium, breastfeeding rates remain low across native and migrant groups while the underlying determinants are unclear. Furthermore, research examining contextual effects, especially regarding gender (in)equality and ideology, has not been conducted. We hypothesized that greater gender equality scores in the country of origin will result in higher breastfeeding chances. Because gender equality does not operate only at the contextual level but can be mediated through individual level resources, we hypothesized the following for maternal education: higher maternal education will be an important positive predictor for exclusive breastfeeding chances in Belgium, but its effects will differ over subsequent origin countries. Based on IKAROS data (GeÏntegreerd Kind Activiteiten en Regio Ondersteunings Systeem), we perform multilevel analyses on 27 936 newborns. Feeding method is indicated by exclusive breastfeeding 3 months after childbirth. We measure gender (in)equality using Global Gender Gap scores from the mother's origin country. Maternal education is a metric variable based on International Standard Classification of Education indicators. Results show that 3.6% of the variation in breastfeeding can be explained by differences between the migrant mother's country of origin. However, the effect of gender (in)equality appears to be non-significant. After adding maternal education, the effect for origin countries scoring low on gender equality turns significant. Maternal education on its own shows strong positive association with exclusive breastfeeding and, furthermore, has different effects for different origin countries.

958,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: The theory of fundamental causes explains why health disparities persist over time, even as risk factors, mechanisms, and diseases change. Using an intersectional framework, we evaluated multifactorial discrimination as a fundamental cause of mental health disparities. Methods: Using baseline data from the Project STRIDE: Stress, Identity, and Mental Health study, we examined the health effects of discrimination among individuals who self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. We used logistic and linear regression to assess whether multifactorial discrimination met the four criteria designating a fundamental cause, namely that the cause: 1) influences multiple health outcomes, 2) affects multiple risk factors, 3) involves access to resources that can be leveraged to reduce consequences of disease, and 4) reproduces itself in varied contexts through changing mechanisms. Results: Multifactorial discrimination predicted high depression scores, psychological well-being, and substance use disorder diagnosis. Discrimination was positively associated with risk factors for high depression scores: chronic strain and total number of stressful life events. Discrimination was associated with significantly lower levels of mastery and self-esteem, protective factors for depressive symptomatology. Even after controlling for risk factors, discrimination remained a significant predictor for high depression scores. Among subjects with low depression scores, multifactorial discrimination also predicted anxiety and aggregate mental health scores. Conclusions: Multifactorial discrimination should be considered a fundamental cause of mental health inequities and may be an important cause of broad health disparities among populations with intersecting social identities.",2017-03-04,Journal,Article,International Journal for Equity in Health,21461,40,16,Multifactorial discrimination as a fundamental cause of mental health inequities,1,true,10.1186/s12939-017-0532-z,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,958,,2017.0,127.0,2.0,,48901040,Caterina Suitner,39293002,A.

959,"© 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.According to the spatial agency bias model, in Western cultures agentic targets are envisaged as facing and acting rightward, in line with writing direction. In four studies of Italian participants, we examined the symbolic association between agency and the rightward direction (Study 1, N = 96), its spontaneous activation when attributing agency to female and male targets (Study 2, N = 80) or when judging the authenticity of photographs of men and women (Study 3, N = 57), and its possible relation to stereotype endorsement (Study 4, N = 80). In Study 4, we used a conditioning paradigm in which participants learned a counterstereotypical new association; we developed a novel measure to assess the association between gender and spatial direction, namely, the spatial association task. Participants envisaged and cognitively processed male and female targets in line with the spatial agency bias model and reported lower benevolent sexism after learning a new counterstereotypical spatial association. Our findings raise awareness about the biased use of space (and its consequences) in the representation of women and men, so that all people, and especially communicators and policy makers, can actively intervene to promote gender equality.

The current study presents the first investigation, to our knowledge, to examine the factor structure of the Feminist Identity Composite with two subsamples of sexual minority women (N = 402). We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA), partial confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and CFA and found both the EFA and subsequent partial CFA (n = 201) indicated a six-factor solution, which was upheld in the final CFA (n = 201). The results generally corroborated four (Passive Acceptance, Embeddedness/Emanation, Synthesis, Active Commitment) of the five original subscales reported in previous studies with predominately heterosexual (or sexual orientation not reported) undergraduate women. However, the subscale Revelation was further delineated into two subscales labeled Societal Revelation and Contact Revelation.

961,"© 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.Although many researchers have explored the relations among gender identification, discriminatory attributions, and intentions to challenge discrimination, few have examined the causal impact of gender identity salience on women’s actual responses to a sexist encounter. In the current study, we addressed this question by experimentally manipulating the salience of gender identity and assessing its impact on women’s decision to confront a sexist comment in a simulated online interaction. Female participants (N = 114) were randomly assigned to complete a short measure of either personal or collective self-esteem, which was designed to increase the salience of personal versus gender identity. They were then given the opportunity to confront a male interaction partner who expressed sexist views. Compared to those who were primed to focus on their personal identity, participants who were primed to focus on their gender identity perceived the interaction partner’s remarks as more sexist and were more likely to engage in confrontation. By highlighting the powerful role of subtle contextual cues in shaping women’s perceptions of, and responses to, sexism, our findings have important implications for the understanding of gender identity salience as an antecedent of prejudice confrontation.

963,"© 2016 The British Psychological SocietySocial dominance orientation (SDO) is conceived as an individual's level of support for group-based hierarchy in general that causes support for more specific group hierarchies. According to social dominance theory, group differences in SDO underpin ideological and behavioural group differences related to specific group hierarchies. Using representative 5-year longitudinal panel data from New Zealand (N = 3,384), we test whether SDO mediates effects of sex and ethnicity on legitimizing myths (LMs) relating to gender and ethnic hierarchy over time. The SDO mediation hypothesis is supported in the case of hostile sexism. However, it is unsupported in the case of benevolent sexism and LMs relating to ethnic hierarchy, where there was no cross-lagged effect of SDO. Moreover, being in the dominant ethnic group is associated with more legitimization of ethnic hierarchy but less legitimization of gender hierarchy, which is inconsistent with the notion of a general orientation underpinning group differences in legitimation. There was mixed evidence for a reverse path whereby specific LMs mediate group differences in SDO across time.

Using three-dimensional data, ontogenetic variation in iliac curvature was investigated in relation to size and chronological age and its accuracy for sex estimation among juveniles was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional geometric morphometric landmarks were collected from virtual models of 53 surface-scanned ilia and used to: (1) quantify differences between male and female shape, and (2) to calculate a measure of sinuosity by extracting linear measurements relative to a plane constructed in virtual space. Results: Males were found to exhibit on average more pronounced curvature of the iliac crest than females in equivalent age groups, and the difference between sexes was more marked on the posterior section of the bone than on the anterior section. Classification accuracy was higher for measurements of sinuosity relative to a three-dimensional plane (62–87%) than for landmarks describing crest shape (64–74%). Conclusions: An increased likelihood of correct male identification (reduced rate of false positive identification) was observed in older children (>5 years).

Survey results in our study and elsewhere show strong gender disparities in anticipated pursuit of Physics after completion of compulsory education. In order to explore the constructions of gender and Physics underlying these trends, we focus on qualitative interview data, applying Foucaultian analysis of discourse to investigate gendered narratives underpinning adolescents’ and their parents’ articulations. This analysis reveals three key discourses at work on the topic of women’s access to Physics: (a) equality of opportunity, (b) continued gender discrimination in and around Physics, and (c) Physics as quintessentially masculine. We additionally identify five distinct narratives supporting the discourse of physics as masculine. These various discourses and narratives are interrogated, and their implications explored. We conclude that it is only by disrupting prevalent constructions of the Physical sciences as a masculine and “hard” domain will we increase the presence of women in the sector.

971,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdBackground Famous face and voice recognition is reported to be impaired both in semantic dementia (SD) and in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), although more severely in the former. In AD a coexistence of perceptual impairment in face and voice processing has also been reported and this could contribute to the altered performance in complex semantic tasks. On the other hand, in SD both face and voice recognition disorders could be related to the prevalence of atrophy in the right temporal lobe (RTL). Objective The aim of the present study was twofold: (1) to investigate famous faces and voices recognition in SD and AD to verify if the two diseases show a differential pattern of impairment, resulting from disruption of different cognitive mechanisms; (2) to check if face and voice recognition disorders prevail in patients with atrophy mainly affecting the RTL. Materials To avoid the potential influence of primary perceptual problems in face and voice recognition, a pool of patients suffering from early SD and AD were administered a detailed set of tests exploring face and voice perception. Thirteen SD (8 with prevalence of right and 5 with prevalence of left temporal atrophy) and 25 CE patients, who did not show visual and auditory perceptual impairment, were finally selected and were administered an experimental battery exploring famous face and voice recognition and naming. Twelve SD patients underwent cerebral PET imaging and were classified in right and left SD according to the onset modality and to the prevalent decrease in FDG uptake in right or left temporal lobe respectively. Correlation of PET imaging and famous face and voice recognition was performed. Results Results showed a differential performance profile in the two diseases, because AD patients were significantly impaired in the naming tests, but showed preserved recognition, whereas SD patients were profoundly impaired both in naming and in recognition of famous faces and voices. Furthermore, face and voice recognition disorders prevailed in SD patients with RTL atrophy, who also showed a conceptual impairment on the Pyramids and Palm Trees test more important in the pictorial than in the verbal modality. Finally, in 12SD patients in whom PET was available, a strong correlation between FDG uptake and face-to-name and voice-to-name matching data was found in the right but not in the left temporal lobe. Discussion The data support the hypothesis of a different cognitive basis for impairment of face and voice recognition in the two dementias and suggest that the pattern of impairment in SD may be due to a loss of semantic representations, while a defect of semantic control, with impaired naming and preserved recognition might be hypothesized in AD. Furthermore, the correlation between face and voice recognition disorders and RTL damage are consistent with the hypothesis assuming that in the RTL person-specific knowledge may be mainly based upon non-verbal representations.",2017-01-08,Journal,Article,Neuropsychologia,18009,31,94,Famous faces and voices: Differential profiles in early right and left semantic dementia and in Alzheimer's disease,2,,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.11.020,Elsevier Ltd,971,Journal of Women & Aging,2017.0,45.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The article discusses the meaning of the findings as they relate to current knowledge about HIV prevention education and midlife and older women and offers recommendations for research and education.'}",7435153,Joanne Altschuler,,,,,,,,,,,96.0,3006.0,30.0,20.0,181.0,7.0,10.0,51.0,3.0,19.0,564.0,10.0,7.0,60.0,4.0,15.0,202.0,6.0,"Psychology, Medicine"

973,"© 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.It is commonly assumed that threatening expressions are perceptually prioritised, possessing the ability to automatically capture and hold attention. Recent evidence suggests that this prioritisation depends on the task relevance of emotion in the case of attention holding and for fearful expressions. Using a hybrid attentional blink (AB) and repetition blindness (RB) paradigm we investigated whether task relevance also impacts on prioritisation through attention capture and perceptual salience, and if these effects generalise to angry expressions. Participants judged either the emotion (relevant condition) or gender (irrelevant condition) of two target facial stimuli (fearful, angry or neutral) imbedded in a stream of distractors. Attention holding and capturing was operationalised as modulation of AB deficits by first target (T1) and second target (T2) expression. Perceptual salience was operationalised as RB modulation. When emotion was task-relevant (Experiment 1; N = 29) fearful expressions captured and held attention, and were more perceptually salient than neutral expressions. Angry expressions captured attention, but were less perceptually salient and capable of holding attention than fearful and neutral expressions. When emotion was task-irrelevant (Experiment 2; N = 30), only fearful attention capture and perceptual salience effects remained significant. Our findings highlight the importance for threat-prioritisation research to heed both the type of threat and prioritisation investigated.",2017-01-02,Journal,Article,Cognition and Emotion,12858,16,31,Differential impact of emotional task relevance on three indices of prioritised processing for fearful and angry facial expressions,1,true,10.1080/02699931.2015.1081873,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,973,,2017.0,51.0,1.0,,1454474787,S.

976,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Young people with disabilities, especially physical disabilities, report worse health than others. This may be because of the disability, lower levels of physical activity, and discrimination. For children with cerebral palsy, access to physiotherapy and physical activity is a crucial prerequisite for good health and function. To date, there is limited knowledge regarding potential gender bias and inequity in habilitation services. Objectives: To map how physiotherapeutic interventions (PTI), physical leisure activity, and physical education are allocated for children with cerebral palsy regarding sex, age, level of gross motor function, and county council affiliation. This was done from a gender and equity perspective. Methods: A register study using data from the Cerebral Palsy follow-Up Program (CPUP). Data included 313 children ≤18 years with cerebral palsy from the five northern counties in Sweden during 2013. Motor impairment of the children was classified according to the expanded and revised Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Results: In three county councils, boys received more physiotherapy interventions and received them more frequently than girls did. Differences between county councils were seen for frequency and reasons for physiotherapy interventions (p < 0.001). The physiotherapist was involved more often with children who had lower motor function and with children who had low physical leisure activity. Children with lower motor function level participated in physical leisure activity less often than children with less motor impairment (p < 0.001). Boys participated more frequently in physical education than did girls (p = 0.028). Conclusion: Gender and county council affiliation affect the distribution of physiotherapy interventions for children with cerebral palsy, and there are associations between gender and physical activity. Thus, the intervention is not always determined by the needs of the child or the degree of impairment. A gender-bias is indicated. Further studies are needed to ensure fair interventions.",2017-01-01,Journal,Article,Global Health Action,17500154705,16,10,Physiotherapeutic interventions and physical activity for children in Northern Sweden with cerebral palsy: A register study from equity and gender perspectives,1,true,10.1080/16549716.2017.1272236,Taylor and Francis Ltd.michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at,976,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2017.0,64.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Experiences in multicultural programs had given facilitators in multicultural Programs an understanding of their responsibility to promote critical consciousness and social justice.'}",48010119,Z.

Method A multicultural research team conducted in-depth interviews with 16 faculty who had extensive experience facilitating cultural discussions. They analyzed transcripts of the interviews thematically, drawing sensitizing insights from Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony. Collaboration and conversation helped the team self-consciously examine their positions toward the data set and be critically reflexive. Results Participant faculty used their prior experience facilitating cultural discussions to create a ""safe space""in which learners could develop critical consciousness. During multicultural interactions they recognized and explicitly addressed issues related to power differentials, racism, implicit bias, and gender bias. They noted the need to be ""facile in attending to pain""as learners brought up traumatic experiences and other sensitive issues including racism and the impact of power dynamics. They built relationships with learners by juxtaposing and exploring the sometimes-conflicting norms of different cultures. Participants were reflective about their own understanding and tendency to be biased. They aimed to break free of such biases while role modeling how to have the courage to speak up.

979,"© 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose - Modern prejudice was examined as a potential predictor of overestimating proportions of minority employees in gender-typed occupations. Strength of conjunction error was considered as an indicator of distorted perceptions of these proportions. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the association between modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error was weaker for gender-untypical than for gender-typical targets. Design/methodology/approach - Modern prejudice was considered as a predictor of overestimations of black female employees in Study 1 (n=183) and black female older employees in Study 2 (n=409). Data were collected using internet-mediated questionnaires. Findings - In Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error when respondents were presented with gender-typical targets. In Study 2, using a sample scoring higher on modern prejudice than in Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism and modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error, irrespective of target occupation. Furthermore, there was an unexpected association between lower sexism and greater strength of conjunction error for gender-typical targets, but not for gender-untypical targets. Research limitations/implications - The findings lend support to the ethnic-prominence hypothesis in that modern racism, but not modern sexism or modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that target non-prototypicality can dilute the effect of modern prejudice on strength of conjunction error.

Using data from the ELSABrasil, a study of Brazilian civil servants, and the Americans’ Changing Lives Study, a nationally-representative sample of U.S. adults, we compare reports of lifetime discrimination among race-by-gender groups in each society. We also consider whether educational attainment explains any group differences, or if differences across groups vary by level of education. Results reveal higher lifetime discrimination experiences among Black respondents in both countries, especially Black men, than among Whites, and lower reports among White women than White men. Brown men and women also reported higher levels than White men in Brazil. For all race-by-gender groups in both countries, except Brazilian White men, reports of discrimination were higher among the more educated, though adjusting for educational differences across groups did not explain group differences. In Brazil, we found the greatest racial disparities among the college educated, while U.S. Black men were more likely to report discrimination than White men at all levels of education.

A control condition was introduced for assessing these attitudes without migrant description.

In Romania, the female migrant was perceived more positively and the benevolent sexism was lower when the home culture was maintained than when it was not.

The results of those investigations, however, vary considerably; moreover, previous meta-analyses also yielded inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVE: To readdress aberrant brain activation in UD as evidenced by neuroimaging experiments on cognitive and/or emotional processing. DATA SOURCES: Neuroimaging experiments published from January 1,1997, to October 1, 2015, were identified by a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using different combinations of the terms fMRI (functionalmagnetic resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography), neural, major depression, depression, major depressive disorder, unipolar depression, dysthymia, emotion, emotional, affective, cognitive, task, memory, working memory, inhibition, control, n-back, and Stroop. STUDY SELECTION: Neuroimaging experiments (using fMRI or PET) reporting whole-brain results of group comparisons between adults with UDand healthy control individuals as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space and using an emotional or/and cognitive challenging task were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Coordinates reported to show significant activation differences between UDand healthy controls during emotional or cognitive processing were extracted. By using the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm, different meta-analyses were calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Meta-analyses tested for brain regions consistently found to show aberrant brain activation in UD compared with controls. Analyses were calculated across all emotional processing experiments, all cognitive processing experiments, positive emotion processing, negative emotion processing, experiments using emotional face stimuli, experiments with a sex discrimination task, and memory processing. All meta-analyses were calculated across experiments independent of reporting an increase or decrease of activity in major depressive disorder. For meta-analyses with a minimum of 17 experiments available, separate analyses were performed for increases and decreases. RESULTS: In total, 57 studies with 99 individual neuroimaging experiments comprising in total 1058 patients were included; 34 of them tested cognitive and 65 emotional processing. Overall analyses across cognitive processing experiments (P >.29) and across emotional processing experiments (P >.47) revealed no significant results. Similarly, no convergence was found in analyses investigating positive (all P >.15), negative (all P >.76), or memory (all P >.48) processes. Analyses that restricted inclusion of confounds (eg, medication, comorbidity, age) did not change the results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Inconsistencies exist across individual experiments investigating aberrant brain activity in UD and replication problems across previous neuroimaging meta-analyses. For individual experiments, these inconsistencies may relate to use of uncorrected inference procedures, differences in experimental design and contrasts, or heterogeneous clinical populations; meta-analytically, differences may be attributable to varying inclusion and exclusion criteria or rather liberal statistical inference approaches.",2017-01-01,Journal,Article,JAMA Psychiatry,21100228547,154,74,Altered brain activity in unipolar depression revisited: Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies,2,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.2783,American Medical Associationsmcleod@itsa.ucsf.edu,982,Current sports medicine reports,2017.0,8.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The Stockholm Consensus, which called for inclusion of male-female (M-F) and female-male athletes so long as they met explicit criteria, was adopted by a number of the sport-specific international federations, many of which conduct events within the summer and winter Olympics.'}",4299209,M.

988,"© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.During the development of an individual from a single cell to prenatal stages to adolescence to adulthood and through the complete life span, humans are exposed to countless environmental and stochastic factors, including estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals. Brain cells and neural circuits are likely to be influenced by estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) because they strongly dependent on estrogens. In this review, we discuss both environmental, epidemiological, and experimental evidence on brain health with exposure to oral contraceptives, hormonal therapy, and EEDs such as bisphenol-A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates, and metalloestrogens, such as, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese. Also we discuss the brain health effects associated from exposure to EEDs including the promotion of neurodegeneration, protection against neurodegeneration, and involvement in various neurological deficits; changes in rearing behavior, locomotion, anxiety, learning difficulties, memory issues, and neuronal abnormalities. The effects of EEDs on the brain are varied during the entire life span and far-reaching with many different mechanisms. To understand endocrine disrupting chemicals mechanisms, we use bioinformatics, molecular, and epidemiologic approaches. Through those approaches, we learn how the effects of EEDs on the brain go beyond known mechanism to disrupt the circulatory and neural estrogen function and estrogen-mediated signaling. Effects on EEDs-modified estrogen and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) signaling genes with exposure to natural estrogen, pharmacological estrogen-ethinyl estradiol, PCBs, phthalates, BPA, and metalloestrogens are presented here. Bioinformatics analysis of gene-EEDs interactions and brain disease associations identified hundreds of genes that were altered by exposure to estrogen, phthalate, PCBs, BPA or metalloestrogens. Many genes modified by EEDs are common targets of both 17 β-estradiol (E2) and NRF1. Some of these genes are involved with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Brain Neoplasms. For example, the search of enriched pathways showed that top ten E2 interacting genes in AD—APOE, APP, ATP5A1, CALM1, CASP3, GSK3B, IL1B, MAPT, PSEN2 and TNF—underlie the enrichment of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) AD pathway. With AD, the six E2-responsive genes are NRF1 target genes: APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1. These genes are also responsive to the following EEDs: ethinyl estradiol (APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), BPA (APBB2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), dibutyl phthalate (DPYSL2, EIF2S1, and ENO1), diethylhexyl phthalate (DPYSL2 and MAPT). To validate findings from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) curated data, we used Bayesian network (BN) analysis on microarray data of AD patients. We observed that both gender and NRF1 were associated with AD. The female NRF1 gene network is completely different from male human AD patients. AD-associated NRF1 target genes—APLP1, APP, GRIN1, GRIN2B, MAPT, PSEN2, PEN2, and IDE—are also regulated by E2. NRF1 regulates targets genes with diverse functions, including cell growth, apoptosis/autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, genomic instability, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and senescence. By activating or repressing the genes involved in cell proliferation, growth suppression, DNA damage/repair, apoptosis/autophagy, angiogenesis, estrogen signaling, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and senescence, and inducing a wide range of DNA damage, genomic instability and DNA methylation and transcriptional repression, NRF1 may act as a major regulator of EEDs-induced brain health deficits. In summary, estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals-modified genes in brain health deficits are part of both estrogen and NRF1 signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that in addition to estrogen signaling, EEDs influencing NRF1 regulated communities of genes across genomic and epigenomic multiple networks may contribute in the development of complex chronic human brain health disorders.",2016-12-13,Journal,Review,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,25879,59,17,Estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals influencing NRF1 regulated gene networks in the development of complex human brain diseases,1,true,10.3390/ijms17122086,MDPI AGPostfachBaselCH-4005,988,International Journal of Epidemiology,2016.0,135.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A more ac-curate picture is painted of the formal causal inference approach, and the key misconceptions underlying VBP and KDS’s critiques are outlined, to conclude that the clarity gained from adopting a rigorous framework is an asset, not an obstacle, to answering more reliably a very wide range of causal questions using data from observational studies of many different designs.'}",144194400,R.

Research reveals multiple ways that women and underrepresented minorities can benefit radiology education, research, and practice. To achieve those benefits, promising practices promote developing and implementing strategies that support diversity as an institutional priority and cultivate shared responsibility among all members to create inclusive learning and workplace environments. Strategies also include providing professional development to empower and equip members to accomplish diversity-related goals. Among topics for professional development about diversity, unconscious bias has shown positive results. Unconscious bias refers to ways humans unknowingly draw upon assumptions about individuals and groups to make decisions about them. Researchers have documented unconscious bias in a variety of contexts and professions, including health care, in which they have studied differential treatment, diagnosis, prescribed care, patient well-being and compliance, physician-patient interactions, clinical decision making, and medical school education. These studies demonstrate unfavorable impacts on members of underrepresented groups and women.

998,"© 2016 International Society for Sexual MedicineIntroduction Few studies exist on the psychosexual outcome of homogeneous groups of individuals with 5α-reductase deficiency type 2 (5α-RD-2) and the relation between gender changes and parental hostile and benevolent sexism, which are two components of ambivalent sexism that assume a stereotypical approach toward women in an overtly negative way or a chivalrous, seemingly positive way. Aim To report on the psychosexual outcome of individuals with 5α-RD-2 and to investigate its relation to the level of parental sexism in a relatively large sample of Iranians with 5α-RD-2. Methods Twenty participants (mean age = 19.5 years, SD = 6.345) with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of 5α-RD-2 who were assigned the female gender at birth and raised as female were included in the study. Participants and their parents were interviewed and their medical records were assessed. Parents also completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), which includes hostile and benevolent sexism subscales. Main Outcome Measures Psychosexual outcome and parental hostile and benevolent sexism measurements. Results Twelve of 20 participants (60%) were diagnosed with gender identity disorder not otherwise specified (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision). Ten of these transitioned to the male gender. The other 10 participants (50%), including the two diagnosed with gender identity disorder not otherwise specified, continued living in a female gender role. When comparing the ASI subscale scores between families of participants who changed their gender and those who did not, no significant difference was found for ASI total and hostile sexism scores, but there was a difference for benevolent sexism (P = .049): those whose daughters had changed their gender had higher benevolent sexism scores. Conclusion The high prevalence of gender change and gender dysphoria reported in the literature was confirmed in this relatively large and homogeneous sample of Iranians with 5-α-RD-2 raised as female. Prenatal exposure to testosterone is hypothesized to play a role in the development of gender identity and sexual orientation, but parental attitudes also might be important.

All rights reserved.Purpose: Given the high attrition rate in the field of academic surgery, we aimed to characterise the professional and personal situations of female and male academic surgeons as well as to gather data on their respective perceptions of career advancement and work satisfaction. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Germany, inviting all identifiable academically highly qualified female surgeons and their male counterparts in a 1:2 ratio to participate. An anonymous 103-item online questionnaire was designed and the data collected between July and September 2014. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 93 female and 200 male surgeons, of whom 63 women (67.7%) and 70 men (35.0%) replied. The average age was 47.5 and 47.1 years, respectively. Respondents identified 'high degree of expertise', 'ambition', and 'clarity of one's professional aims' as important factors affecting professional career development. Both groups felt 'workload', 'working hours/shifts', and 'gender' to be a hindrance, the latter of significantly greater importance to female surgeons. The mean work satisfaction scores were high in both female (69.5%) and male (75.7%) surgeons. The predictors 'support from superiors' (standardised β coefficient = 0.41) and 'manual aptitude' (β = 0.41) contributed incrementally to the variance in 'high degree of work satisfaction' (90-100%) observed for female surgeons.

Still, empathy/altruism and narcissism/honesty-humility are related traits and also potent predictors of prejudice. Thus, we examined whether there is an association between prejudice and agreeableness, as a global trait, or if the correlations depend on facets that are part of the broader FFM factor, but belong to other dimensions in the HEXACO model. We further analyzed how well the documented relations of agreeableness on prejudice hold up when entered alongside empathy/altruism and honesty-humility within the HEXACO framework. Results from Sweden and the United States showed that only FFM agreeableness, and not the HEXACO counterpart, correlates with an index of prejudice (racism and sexism). Furthermore, the negative relations of FFM agreeableness were absent or reversed in regression analyses with the other HEXACO predictors. Instead, we found negative effects of honesty-humility and empathy/altruism on prejudice.

Analogous to sexual double standards, dating double standards reflect the greater agency and power traditionally accorded to men in society. In the present study, we investigated factors related to young heterosexual adults’ endorsement of dating double standards. Participants were 330 female and male U.S. undergraduates at a California public university (57 % female, ages 18–25 years-old) from diverse ethnic backgrounds. In the Heterosexual Dating Double-Standards Scale, respondents rate the desirability of five dating and courtship behaviors (initiate date, hold door open, pay for date, propose marriage, take spouse’s last name) separately for women and men. Preliminary analyses revealed participants generally expressed double standards by rating the desirability of behaviors differently for female and male characters in the traditional direction (e.g., paying for a date rated more desirable for a man than for a woman). We predicted dating double standards would be positively related to factors previously found to predict traditional gender roles (viewing popular media, religious attendance) as well as attitudes that reflect traditional views (conservative political beliefs, benevolent and hostile sexism, disavowing a feminist identity). These hypotheses were generally supported. Among these correlations, dating double standards were strongly associated with benevolent sexism (among women and men) and with hostile sexism (among men).

In three studies, we examined whether there is a positive association between sexism and the tendency to exaggerate psychological gender differences.

Study 2 documented that the more strongly people endorsed hostile or benevolent sexism, the more likely they were to exaggerate the size of gender differences. In Studies 1 and 2, women perceived gender differences to be larger than did men, after accounting for sexism. Finally, Study 3 showed that increasing (decreasing) the perceived size of gender differences predicts corresponding increases (decreases) in sexism.

The present research investigated whether delivering a sexist remark as a joke, compared to a serious statement, tempered perceptions that the speaker was sexist which, in turn, made women less likely to confront. Using a computer-mediated instant messaging paradigm, women were randomly assigned to receive the same sexist remark phrased either in a serious manner or as a joke. We recorded how women actually responded to the sexist remark and coded for confrontation. In Experiments 1 (195 women) and 2 (134 women) we found that humor decreased perceptions that the speaker was sexist. Furthermore, as perceptions that the perpetrator was sexist decreased, women’s confronting also decreased. Experiment 2 demonstrated an additional consequence of reducing the perceived sexism of the perpetrator—it increased tolerance of sexist behavior perpetrated against an individual woman and sexual harassment more generally. Interestingly, the indirect effects only appeared when women at least moderately endorsed hostile sexism.

Cranium, humerus, and os coxae of 60 skeletons (30 male, 30 female) from the Chiang Mai University Skeletal Collection were scanned by XRF and differences in elemental profiles between male and female bones determined using discriminant analysis. In the cranium, three elements (S, Ca, Pb) were significantly higher in males and five elements (Si, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ag) plus light elements (atomic number lower than 12) were higher in females. In humerus and os coxae, nine elements were significantly higher in male and one element was higher in female samples. The accuracy rate for sex estimation was 60, 63, and 61 % for cranium, humerus, and os coxae, respectively, and 67 % when data for all three bones were combined. We conclude that there are sex differences in bone elemental profiles; however, the accuracy of XRF analyses for discriminating between male and female samples was low compared to standard morphometric and molecular methods.

1014,"© 2016 Muraya et al.Background: Nutrition plays an important role in child survival and development. Treatment action in the management of child health and nutrition is influenced by perceptions of illness, and gender plays an important role. However, little is known about if and how moderate undernutrition is recognised among lay populations, or how local social norms and intra-household dynamics affect decisions to seek biomedical assistance for nutritional concerns. In this paper we describe how childhood nutritional problems are recognised and understood within rural households. We demonstrate how context influences local constructs of 'normal', and suggest the centrality of gender in the management of child health and nutrition in our research context. Methods: This qualitative study was undertaken in Kilifi County on the Kenyan Coast. A set of 15 households whose children were engaged in a community-based nutrition intervention were followed up over a period of twelve months. Over a total of 54 household visits, group and individual in-depth interviews were conducted with a range of respondents, supplemented by non-participant observations. Eight in-depth interviews with community representatives were also conducted. Results: Local taxonomies of childhood undernutrition were found to overlap with, but differ from, biomedical categories. In particular, moderate undernutrition was generally not recognised as a health problem requiring treatment action, but rather as routine and manageable, typically seasonal, weight-loss. Where symptoms were considered more serious and requiring remedial action, household management strategies were typically based on perceived aetiology of the illness. Additionally, gender emerged as a potentially central theme in childhood nutrition problems and related management. Women reported that they have primary responsibility for ensuring children's good health and nutritional status, and that they are often held accountable when their children are of sub-optimal health. Conclusion: Perceptions of child nutrition and illness and gendered roles within households influence treatment action, and engagement with nutrition interventions.

1015,"© 2016 American College of SurgeonsBackground The objective of this study was to characterize potential disparities in academic output, NIH-funding, and academic rank between male and female surgical faculty and identify subspecialties in which these differences may be more pronounced. Study Design Eighty metrics for 4,015 faculty members at the top-55 NIH-funded departments of surgery were collected. Demographic characteristics, NIH funding details, and scholarly output were analyzed. A new metric, academic velocity (V), reflecting recent citations is defined. Results Overall, 21.5% of surgical faculty are women. The percentage of female faculty is highest in science/research (41%) and surgical oncology (34%), and lowest in cardiothoracic surgery (9%). Female faculty are less likely to be full professors (22.7% vs 41.2%) and division chiefs (6.2% vs 13.6%). The fraction of women who are full professors is lowest in cardiothoracic surgery. Overall median numbers of publications/citations are lower for female faculty compared with male surgical faculty (21 of 364 vs 43 of 723, p < 0.001), and these differences are more pronounced for assistant professors. Current/previous NIH funding (21.3% vs 24%, p = NS) rates are similar between women and men, and surgical departments with more female full professors have higher NIH funding ranking (R2 = 0.14, p < 0.05). In certain subspecialties, female associate and full professors outperform male counterparts. Overall, female authors have higher numbers of more recent citations. Conclusions Subspecialty involvement and academic performance differences by sex vary greatly by subspecialty type and are most pronounced at the assistant professor level. Identification of potential barriers for entry of women into certain subspecialties, causes for the observed lower number of publications/citations among female assistant professors, and obstacles for attaining leadership roles need to be determined.

1016,"© 2016 National Taiwan University.Physiological reflection of emotions can be tracked by autonomic signals. Several studies have been conducted using autonomic signal processing to examine men and women differences during the exposure of affective stimuli. Emotional pictures and music are two commonly used methods to induce affects in an experimental setup. The biological changes have been commonly monitored during a certain emotional inducement protocol, solely. This study was aimed to examine two induction paradigms involved auditory and visual cues using nonlinear dynamical approaches. To this end, various nonlinear parameters of galvanic skin response (GSR) and pulse signals of men and women were examined. The nonlinear analysis was performed using lagged Poincare parameters, detrended fluctuation indices (DFAs), Lyapunov exponents (LEs), some entropy measures, and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to show significant differences between the groups. The results indicate that besides the type of affect induction, physiological differences of men and women are notable in negative emotions (sadness and fear). Regardless to the inducements, lagged Poincare parameters of the pulse signals and DFA indices of the GSR have shown significant differences in gender affective responses. However, applying pictorial stimuli, LEs are appropriate indicators for gender discrimination. It is also concluded that GSR dynamics are intensely affected by the kind of stimuli; while this is not validated for the pulse. These findings suggest that different emotional inductions evoked different autonomic responses in men and women, which can be appropriately monitored using nonlinear signal processing approaches.",2016-08-01,Journal,Article,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications",92049,8,28,Gender differences in response to affective audio and visual inductions: Examination of nonlinear dynamics of autonomic signals,0,false,10.4015/S1016237216500241,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Results revealed that recent sexist experiences and endorsement of traditional feminine gender roles significantly and positively predicted self-silencing, whereas a commitment to social change significantly and negatively predicted self-silencing. In addition, lifetime sexist experiences were associated with greater self-silencing for women with low levels of commitment to social change, but not for women with average or high levels, suggesting a buffering effect. Women who were less committed to social change demonstrated higher levels of self-silencing when sexual objectification experiences were less frequent; women with higher levels of commitment to social change were less likely to self-silence, regardless of the frequency of sexual objectification experiences.

Consistent with predictions, undergraduate participants who strongly vs. weakly endorsed gender stereotypes, either chronically (Study 1, N = 147) or when situationally primed (Study 2, N = 258), were less likely to attribute gender disparities in the workplace to discrimination. In addition, participants unexpectedly made stronger discrimination attributions when explaining gender gaps in leadership positions than in STEM occupations, suggesting that interventions for addressing gender discrimination may need to use different strategies for different contexts. Overall, results are consistent with the notion that stereotypes influence explanations for group disparities in ways that justify existing social arrangements as fair, just, and legitimate.

1019,"© 2015, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.Background: Several studies have reported that women are more likely to receive inappropriate SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), suggesting gender disparity in AUC determination. We investigated the impact of gender on the diagnostic and prognostic utility of AUC. Methods and Results: We analyzed a multi-site prospective cohort of 1511 consecutive patients (43.5% women) who underwent outpatient, community-based SPECT-MPI. Subjects were stratified into gender groups and appropriateness subgroups, and followed for 27 ± 10 months for cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization. Women were more likely to receive inappropriate MPI (60.7% vs 33.8%, P < .001). Irrespective of appropriateness, women were less likely to have an abnormal MPI (6.1% vs 14.9%, P < .001), even after adjusting for clinical covariates [odds ratio = 0.40 (95% confidence interval = 0.26-0.60), P < .001]. Irrespective of appropriateness, women were at lower risk for MACE (composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization) after adjusting for clinical and imaging covariates [hazard ratio = 0.49 (95% confidence interval = 0.28-0.86), P = .01]. There was no interaction between gender and appropriateness group as a determinant of abnormal MPI or MACE (interaction P values ≥ .26), indicating that female gender was associated with similar relative risk of an abnormal MPI and MACE irrespective of appropriateness group. Abnormal MPI was similarly predictive of increased hazard of MACE in both genders, regardless of appropriateness (interaction P values ≥ .46). Conclusion: In this multi-site cohort, there was no demonstrable gender-based differential impact of AUC on the diagnostic or prognostic utility of SPECT-MPI.

1020,"Background Limited data are available to assess whether access to and quality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) care are comparable among men and women in India. We analyzed data from the American College of Cardiology's PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) India Quality Improvement Program (PIQIP) to evaluate gender disparities in CVD care delivery. Methods and results Between 2011 and 2015, we collected data on performance measures for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 14,010), heart failure (HF) (n = 11,965) and atrial fibrillation (AF) (n = 496) in PIQIP, among 17 participating practices. The total number of women was 31,796 (32.0%). Women had fewer total encounters compared to men during the study interval (mean number of encounters = 2.59 vs. 2.82 for women and men, respectively, p ≤ 0.001). Women were significantly younger (48.9 years vs. 51.5 years, p ≤ 0.01), but had a higher co-morbidity burden compared to men - hypertension (62.0% vs. 45.6%, p ≤ 0.01), diabetes (39.4% vs. 35%, p ≤ 0.01), and hyperlipidemia (3.7% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.19). On the contrary, the guideline-directed medication prescriptions were strikingly lower in women with CAD compared to men - aspirin (38% vs. 50.4%, p ≤ 0.001), aspirin or thienopyridine combination (46.9% vs. 57.2%, p ≤ 0.001), and beta-blockers (36.8% vs. 47.8%, p ≤ 0.001). Similarly, among women with ejection fraction ≤ 40%, the use of guideline-directed medical therapy was significantly lower compared to men for beta-blockers (30.8% vs. 37.0%, p ≤ 0.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (29.3% vs. 34.9%, p ≤ 0.001), and beta-blockers/ACE-i or ARBs (24.6% vs. 31.0%, p ≤ 0.001). Among patients with atrial fibrillation and CHADS2 score ≥ 2, more women were on oral anticoagulation (19.6% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.34), although this was not significantly different, and the overall number of patients with atrial fibrillation was low.

1023,"© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.In June 2015, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the USA published a new funding guideline entitled Consideration of Sex as a Biological Variable in NIH-funded Research. This guideline is part of the NIH policy to enhance quality and generalizability of health research. Its core element is the classification of sex as a key element of rigorous study designs. The requirement is that sex be defined as a biological variable, and taking the potentially relevant sex/gender related anatomical and physiological characteristics into account. In Germany, the Guidelines and recommendations to assure good epidemiological practice (GEP) of 1998 specify that the study design and research methods are to be designed so that sex/gender-specific aspects of the research question can be adequately detected. Mostly health research is restricted to the categorization of the study population into men and women and to the consideration of the sex/gender variable (man∗woman) in the analyses. Research in accordance with the NIH guideline as well as with the German GEP needs to investigate differences and similarities between men and women, and also to look for factors that explain in what way being a man or a woman poses a risk or is protective against the development of diseases. This scientific basis is essential for the development and implementation of sex/gender equitable prevention, health promotion and health care, which in turn enables statutory health insurances to take sex/gender differences into account regarding the medical services they provide. The latter is a consequence of the current legal position in Germany, which is based on the Prevention law that was passed in 2015. In addition to the categorical sex/gender variable (man∗woman), there is therefore the need to analytically differentiate between the dimensions sex (the biological factors) and gender (the socio-cultural ascriptions) as well as their interaction. For conceptual clarity, this paper proposes that the terms sex and/or gender be used only where the biological and/or socio-cultural aspects of being a man or a woman are explicitly taken into account. For the common sex/gender variable man∗woman (based on self-reports, register data etc.) the term Survey sex (German: Erhebungsgeschlecht) can be used. Further, the establishment of a Federal Institute Geschlecht und Gesundheit - Sex/Gender and Health is recommended.",2016-07-01,Journal,Article,Gesundheitswesen,20796,0,78,Sex/Gender-Responsive Health Research: New Funding Guidelines of the USA National Institutes of Health Can Bring a New Impetus to Germany Geschlechtergerechte Gesundheitsforschung - Aktuelle Vorgaben der National Institutes of Health in den USA können neuen Schwung auch nach Deutschland bringen - Diskussionsbeitrag,0,false,10.1055/s-0042-106647,Georg Thieme Verlagkunden.service@thieme.de,1023,Journal of Sexual Medicine,2016.0,49.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Perceived personal discrimination and social support from different sources predicted domains of QoL with a non-uniform pattern in individuals with gender dysphoria (GD); social support and discrimination were found to have\xa0opposing contributions toQoL in GD.'}",5894125,K.

1024,"© 2016 International Society for Sexual Medicine.Introduction: Transgender individuals experience discrimination in all domains of their personal and social life. Discrimination is believed to be associated with worse quality of life (QoL). Aim: To investigate the relation between QoL and perceived levels of discrimination and social support in individuals with gender dysphoria (GD). Methods: Individuals with GD who attended a psychiatry clinic from January 2012 through December 2014 were recruited. Demographic, social, and medical transition features were collected with standardized forms. Main Outcome Measures: Self-report measurements of QoL (Turkish version of the World Health Organization's Quality of Life-BREF) that included physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains, perceived discrimination with personal and group subscales (Perceived Discrimination Scale [PDS]), and social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) were completed. Results: Ninety-four participants (76.6% trans men) adequately completed the study measurements. Regression models with each QoL domain score as a dependent variable indicated a significant predictor value of personal PDS in social and environmental QoL. Social support from family was associated with better QoL in psychological QoL, whereas perceived support from friends significantly predicted all other domains of QoL. There was a tendency for group PDS to be rated higher than personal PDS, suggesting personal vs group discrimination discrepancy. However, group PDS was not found to be a predictor of QoL in the multivariate model. Conclusion: Perceived personal discrimination and social support from different sources predicted domains of QoL with a non-uniform pattern in individuals with GD. Social support and discrimination were found to have opposing contributions to QoL in GD. The present findings emphasize the necessity of addressing discrimination and social support in clinical work with GD. Moreover, strategies to improve and strengthen friend and family support for individuals with GD should be explored by clinicians.

1025,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.Although it is widely accepted that discrimination is associated with heavy and hazardous drinking, particularly within stress and coping frameworks, there has been no comprehensive review of the evidence. In response, we conducted a systematic review of the English language peer-reviewed literature to summarize studies of discrimination and alcohol-related outcomes, broadly defined. Searching six online data bases, we identified 938 non-duplicative titles published between 1980 and 2015, of which 97 met all inclusion criteria for our review and reported quantitative tests of associations between discrimination and alcohol use. We extracted key study characteristics and assessed quality based on reported methodological details. Papers generally supported a positive association; however, the quantity and quality of evidence varied considerably. The largest number of studies was of racial/ethnic discrimination among African Americans in the United States, followed by sexual orientation and gender discrimination. Studies of racial/ethnic discrimination were notable for their frequent use of complex modeling (i.e., mediation, moderation) but focused nearly exclusively on interpersonal discrimination. In contrast, studies of sexual orientation discrimination (i.e., heterosexism, homophobia) examined both internalized and interpersonal aspects; however, the literature largely relied on global tests of association using cross-sectional data. Some populations (e.g., Native Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders) and types of discrimination (e.g., systemic/structural racism; ageism) received scant attention.

Possibly due to their social significance, faces may be an exceptional domain: That is, task-irrelevant faces can escape perceptual load effects. Here we tested voice processing, to study whether voice gender aftereffects (VGAEs) depend on low or high perceptual (Exp. 1) or working memory (Exp. 2) load in a relevant visual task. Participants adapted to irrelevant voices while either searching digit displays for a target (Exp. 1) or recognizing studied digits (Exp. 2). We found that the VGAE was unaffected by perceptual load, indicating that task-irrelevant voices, like faces, can also escape perceptual-load effects.

1027,"© 2016 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.Purpose The unequal representation of women and people of color compared with men and whites in medical school textbooks has been well documented, as have health care inequities, and biases - both overt and implicit - by health care providers and in access to care. The authors investigated whether this bias exists in PowerPoint slides used in didactic material for preclinical students at one medical school. Method The authors analyzed 747 ""decks"" of slides from 33 preclinical courses in the medical school curriculum at the University of Washington School of Medicine in the years spanning 2009 to 2011. The authors coded the human images into various sex- and race-specific classifications and evaluated the distribution of images into these categories. Results Of the 4,033 images that could be coded by sex, 39.6% (1,595) were female and 60.5% (2,438) were male. Of the 5,230 images that could be coded by race/ethnicity, 78.4% (4,100) were white and 21.6% (1,130) were persons of color. Thus, images of whites and males predominated. Conclusions The proportion of images used in didactic courses at one school of medicine is not representative of the U.S. population in terms of race or sex.

1028,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.Because body weight is largely seen as controllable, weight stigma-the social devaluation of those who are overweight-is not subject to the social norms that condemn open expression of racism and sexism. Indeed, rejection of peers based on perceptions of excess weight is normative. Since weight stigma is internalized, popular views (and often the views of physicians) have suggested that increasing the salience of weight stigma might produce a reduction in overeating and/or an increase in physical activity. However, that perspective is not rooted in scientific evidence. Recent randomized controlled designs demonstrate that stigma may promote overeating. Correlational evidence suggests that self-reported stigma experience is associated with risk for binge eating and decreased interest in physical exercise and dieting, for children and adults.

1029,"© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Perceptions of intergroup threat have been related to both experiences of physiological stress responses and derogation of the outgroup. In this study, a neuroscience perspective was used to investigate the relationship between stress and opportunity to derogate the outgroup, in a threatening intergroup context. Research from a social identity perspective suggests that engaging in outgroup derogation alleviates stress when perceiving an intergroup threat. However, in line with the model of intergroup anxiety, opportunity to derogate could exacerbate the negative connotations of a threatening situation, resulting in more stress. Canadian participants (N = 110) were exposed to text describing either discriminatory or favorable comments expressed by Chinese individuals towards Canadians. Half of the participants were given the opportunity to derogate via a bias task. Salivary cortisol was used as a measure of stress and was collected at baseline, post-threat, and post-derogation. As expected, threatening identity led to more stress as evidenced by increased cortisol concentrations. Furthermore, threatened participants who had an opportunity to derogate showed greater cortisol concentrations than those who did not. These results demonstrate a link between stress and the opportunity to derogate, and highlights the value of using biological markers within the intergroup context.

1031,"© 2016 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.Abstract: Previous research has shown that discriminated women blame themselves more than they blame discrimination when meritocracy values are salient. In two studies, we examined whether meritocracy values also influence female observers when they judge a female victim of sexism. Such values were expected to lead them to judge more positively a victim incriminating herself than a victim claiming discrimination. Conversely, social equality values should lead them to judge more positively a victim claiming discrimination. Women who were either feminists or non-feminists (Study 1) or who were exposed to either social equality values or personal merit values (Study 2) had to judge a female victim of sexism who ascribed what happened to discrimination or to her ability. Feminist women and women exposed to social equality judged the female victim more positively when she reported discrimination than when she incriminated herself. The reverse pattern of judgement was observed for non-feminist women and women exposed to meritocracy values.

1032,"© 2015 Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences.Femora are a well preserved section of the skeleton after death. Therefore, they are commonly used in the field of forensic sciences, physical anthropology and anatomy. In addition, femur morphometry is helpful in finding sex or side (left or right) differences. The femur also shows characteristics of certain populations. Femur length is important for calculation of individual stature. In this study, the artificial neural network method was used to estimate femur length. In total, 230 femora exemplar were used. The three input parameters of the method were the distance between trochanter major top point and trochanter minor bottom point, the diameter of caput femoris and the diameter of collum femoris. By using these parameters, the artificial neural network estimation on femur length was performed. The results show that the method is capable of performing this estimation.

Medical interventions on often healthy bodies remain the norm, addressing perceived familial and cultural demands, despite concerns about necessity, outcomes, conduct and consent. A global and decentralised intersex movement pursues simple core goals: the rights to bodily autonomy and self-determination, and an end to stigmatisation. The international human rights system is responding with an array of new policy statements from human rights institutions and a handful of national governments recognising the rights of intersex people. However, major challenges remain to implement those statements. Human rights violations of intersex individuals persist, deeply embedded in a deliberate history of silencing. Rhetoric of change to clinical practices remain unsubstantiated. Policy disjunctions arise in a framing of intersex issues as matters of sexual orientation and gender identity, rather than innate sex characteristics; this has led to a rhetoric of inclusion that is not matched by the reality.

The integration of educated, trained, regulated and licensed midwives into the health system is associated with improved quality of care and sustained decreases in maternal and newborn mortality. To date, research on barriers to quality of care for women and newborns has not given due attention to the care provider's perspective. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the findings of a systematic mapping of the literature of the social, economic and professional barriers preventing midwifery personnel in low and middle income countries (LMICs) from providing quality of care. Methods and Findings: A systematic search of five electronic databases for literature published between January 1990 and August 2013. Eligible items included published and unpublished items in all languages. Items were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielding 82 items from 34 countries. 44% discussed countries or regions in Africa, 38% in Asia, and 5% in the Americas. Nearly half the articles were published since 2011. Data was extracted and presented in a narrative synthesis and tables. Items were organized into three categories; social; economic and professional barriers, based on an analytical framework. Barriers connected to the socially and culturally constructed context of childbirth, although least reported, appear instrumental in preventing quality midwifery care. Conclusions: Significant social and cultural, economic and professional barriers can prevent the provision of quality midwifery care in LMICs. An analytical framework is proposed to show how the overlaps between the barriers reinforce each other, and that they arise from gender inequality. Links are made between burn out and moral distress, caused by the barriers, and poor quality care. Ongoing mechanisms to improve quality care will need to address the barriers from the midwifery provider perspective, as well as the underlying gender inequality.",2016-05-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,136,11,What prevents quality midwifery care?

The neural mechanisms underlying depression in psychosis are poorly understood. Given reports of altered brain response to negative facial affect in depressive disorders, we examined brain response to emotive facial expressions in relation to levels of depression in people with psychosis. Seventy outpatients (final N = 63) and 20 healthy participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during an implicit affect processing task involving presentation of facial expressions of fear, anger, happiness as well as neutral expressions and a (no face) control condition. All patients completed Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and had their symptoms assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In patients, depression (BDI-II) scores associated positively with activation of the left thalamus, extending to the putamen-globus pallidus, insula, inferior-middle frontal and para-post-pre-central gyri during fearful expressions. Furthermore, patients with moderate-to-severe depression had significantly higher activity in these brain regions during fearful expressions relative to patients with no, minimal, or mild depression and healthy participants.

To date, however, theoretical attention to the social cognitive processes that regulate workplace harassment is scant. This article presents the development and preliminary validation of the Moral Disengagement in Sexual Harassment Scale (MDiSH); a self-report measure of moral disengagement in the context of hostile work environment harassment. Three studies (total n=797) document the excellent psychometric properties of this new scale. Male U.K. university students (Study 1: n=322) and U.S. working males (Studies 2 and 3: n=475) completed the MDiSH and an array of measures for construct validation. The MDiSH exhibited positive correlations with sexual harassment myth acceptance, male gender identification, and hostile sexism. In Study 3, participants were exposed to a fictitious case of hostile work environment harassment. The MDiSH attenuated moral judgment, negative emotions (guilt, shame, and anger), sympathy, and endorsement of prosocial behavioral intentions (support for restitution) associated with the harassment case.

Materials and methods Survival curves of 152 fibroblast cell strains derived from both gender were generated. Individual radiosensitivity was characterized by the surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2). SNPs in 10 radiation responsive genes were genotyped by direct sequencing. Results The wide variation in SF2 (0.12-0.50; mean = 0.33) was significantly associated with 3 SNPs: TP53 G72C (P = 0.007), XRCC1 G399A (P = 0.002) and ATM G1853A (P = 0.01). Females and males differed significantly in radiosensitivity (P = 0.004) that impacted genetic association where only XRCC1 remained significant in both gender (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, discordant association was observed for TP53 that was significant in females (P = 0.012) and ATM that was significant in males (P = 0.0006). When gender-specific SF2-mean (0.31 and 0.35 for females and males; respectively) was considered, further discordance was observed where XRCC1 turned out not to be associated with radiosensitivity in males (P > 0.05).

To examine these associations, we draw from multiple perspectives, including Robinson and Trail’s (2005) work on identification, Herek’s (2007, 2009) sexual stigma and prejudice theory, and McCormack and Anderson’s (2014a, 2014b) theory of homohysteria.

Learners in different sociopolitical settings can join together in developing critical consciousness—awareness of power and privilege dynamics in society—by means of communication technology. The aim of this research was to define strengths and limitations of existing cross-cultural discussions in generating critical consciousness. The setting was the FAIMER international fellowship program for mid-career interdisciplinary health faculty, whose goal is to foster global advancement of health professions education. Fellows take part in participant-led, online, written, task-focused discussions on topics like professionalism, community health, and leadership. We reflexively identified text that brought sociopolitical topics into the online environment during the years 2011 and 2012 and used a discourse analysis toolset to make our content analysis relevant to critical consciousness. While references to participants’ cultures and backgrounds were infrequent, narratives of political-, gender-, religion-, and other culture-related topics did emerge. When participants gave accounts of their experiences and exchanged cross-cultural stories, they were more likely to develop ad hoc networks to support one another in facing those issues than explore issues relating to the development of critical consciousness. We suggest that cross-cultural discussions need to be facilitated actively to transform learners’ frames of reference, create critical consciousness, and develop cultural competence.

1040,"Male gender is protective against multiple sclerosis and other T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. This protection may be due, in part, to higher androgen levels in males. Androgen binds to the androgen receptor (AR) to regulate gene expression, but how androgen protects against autoimmunity is not well understood. Autoimmune regulator (Aire) prevents autoimmunity by promoting self-antigen expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells, such that developing T cells that recognize these self-antigens within the thymus undergo clonal deletion. Here we show that androgen upregulates Aire-mediated thymic tolerance to protect against autoimmunity. Androgen recruits AR to Aire promoter regions, with consequent enhancement of Aire transcription. In mice and humans, thymic Aire expression is higher in males compared with females. Androgen administration and male gender protect against autoimmunity in a multiple sclerosis mouse model in an Aire-dependent manner. Thus, androgen control of an intrathymic Aire-mediated tolerance mechanism contributes to gender differences in autoimmunity.",2016-04-13,Journal,Article,Nature Communications,19700182758,83,7,Sex bias in CNS autoimmune disease mediated by androgen control of autoimmune regulator,1,true,10.1038/ncomms11350,"Nature Publishing GroupHoundmillsBasingstoke, HampshireRG21 6XS",1040,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2016.0,5.0,5.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The authors convincingly establish that there is little evidence for this strict sexually dimorphic view of human brains, counter to the popular lay conception of a “male” and “female” brain.'}",6609752,A.

This monograph of the SRCD is concerned with central topics of child gender, gendered parenting, gendered environments, and gendered behaviors and socializing practices in the underresearched and underserved world of LMIC. To examine protective and risk factors related to child gender in LMIC around the world, we used data from more than 2 million individuals in 400,000 families in 41 LMIC collected in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, a household survey that includes nationally representative samples of participating countries. In the first chapter of this monograph, we describe the conceptual ""gender similarities"" and ""bioecological"" frameworks that helped guide the monograph. In the second chapter, we detail the general methodology adhered to in the substantive chapters. Then, in topical chapters, we describe the situations of girls and boys with successive foci on child growth and mortality, parental caregiving, family discipline and violence, and child labor. We conclude with a general discussion of findings from the substantive chapters in the context of gender and bioecological theories.

Based on previous research, a classification of harmful workplace experiences affecting women is proposed and then used in the analysis of 88 studies with 93 independent samples, containing 73,877 working women. We compare the associations of different harmful workplace experiences and job stressors with women’s work attitudes and health. Random-effects meta-analysis and path analysis showed that more intense yet less frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention) and less intense but more frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexist organizational climate and gender harassment) had similar negative effects on women’s well-being. Harmful workplace experiences were independent from and as negative as job stressors in their impact on women’s occupational well-being. The power imbalance between the target and the perpetrator appeared as a potential factor to explain the type and impact of harmful workplace experiences affecting women’s occupational well-being. In the discussion, we identify several gaps in the literature, suggest directions for future research, and suggest organizational policy changes and interventions that could be effective at reducing the incidence of harmful workplace experiences.

This hypothesis was tested with a meta-analysis of studies on the evaluation of individuals behaving dominantly, including articles not directly investigating gender. Results revealed that dominance indeed hurts women's, relative to men's, likability (although the overall effect is small, d = -0.19, k = 63), as well as more downstream outcomes such as hireability (d = -0.58, k = 20). More important, however, dominance expressed explicitly (e.g., direct demands) affected women's likability (d = -0.28) whereas implicit forms of dominance (e.g., eye contact) did not (d = 0.03). Finally, the effect of dominance on men's and women's perceived competence did not differ (d = 0.02, k = 31), consistent with the idea that it is interpersonal (rather than instrumental) evaluations that obstruct women leaders.

1058,"© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Background: Experiences with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) discrimination and racism have both been associated with mental health problems and illicit drug use. However, the cumulative effects of both forms of discrimination-and resulting internalized oppression-on illicit drug use in LGBTQ people of color (POC) has not been examined in the research literature. Methods: Using online questionnaires, this study collected self-report data from 200 LGBTQ POC about their experiences with racism, LGBTQ discrimination, internalized racism, internalized LGBTQ discrimination, and illicit drug use. Results: Two structural equation models yielded adequate fit indices in which experiences with racism and LGBTQ discrimination led to more internalized oppression, which then led to greater illicit drug use magnitude. LGBTQ discrimination was directly related to increased internalized oppression, which was positively associated with illicit drug use magnitude; the relationship between LGBTQ discrimination and illicit drug use magnitude was mediated by internalized oppression in both models. However, racism and the interaction between racism and LGBTQ discrimination did not show valid direct effects on internalized oppression or indirect effects on illicit drug use magnitude. Conclusions: LGBTQ POC can be the targets of both racism and LGBTQ discrimination, although the current study found that the most psychologically damaging effects may come from LGBTQ discrimination.

1063,"© 2016 Zareen Zaidi et al.Background: Sociocultural theories state that learning results from people participating in contexts where social interaction is facilitated. There is a need to create such facilitated pedagogical spaces where participants can share their ways of knowing and doing. The aim of this exploratory study was to introduce pedagogical space for sociocultural interaction using 'Identity Text'. Methods: Identity Texts are sociocultural artifacts produced by participants, which can be written, spoken, visual, musical, or multimodal. In 2013, participants of an international medical education fellowship program were asked to create their own Identity Texts to promote discussion about participants' cultural backgrounds. Thematic analysis was used to make the analysis relevant to studying the pedagogical utility of the intervention. Result: The Identity Text intervention created two spaces: a 'reflective space', which helped participants reflect on sensitive topics such as institutional environments, roles in interdisciplinary teams, and gender discrimination, and a 'narrative space', which allowed participants to tell powerful stories that provided cultural insights and challenged cultural hegemony; they described the conscious and subconscious transformation in identity that evolved secondary to struggles with local power dynamics and social demands involving the impact of family, peers, and country of origin.

Globally, the population of young people is booming with the most rapid growth among young people in the poorest countries. While already faced with significant issues related to development and thriving, this population boom also exacerbates equity and justice for these children. Given this urgent situation, this chapter builds from the large body of minority world research, as well as the emergent majority world research, to argue that in order to turn the youth bulge into a demographic dividend, researchers must utilize a positive development framing rather than the more dominant problem-focused framing in studying these issues. The structural challenges confronting young people growing up in contexts marked by poverty; weak systems and institutions, especially those serving education, health, and justice; weak political and governance systems; and continual conflict must also be addressed by global and national governmental bodies. This chapter will emphasize the strengths and opportunities of the majority world, highlighting some of the strong, emergent examples of programs that support and develop the strengths of young people.

1079,"© 2015 Nuruddin and Hadden.Background: Pakistan ranks third lowest on a global gender index (2013) and 13th highest on the prevalence of underweight among under-five children (2010). Through this population-based study, we examined gender differentials in the prevalence of stunting, wasting and under-weight defined by World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Standard among rural pre-school Pakistani children. Methods: We performed secondary analysis of data collected through a cross-sectional survey of Thatta district during 1992-93. Prevalence ratios were calculated for 1051 children aged 0-35 months from 95 randomly selected villages of rural Pakistan using a clustered adjusted log binomial model. Level 1 variables included child and household characteristics and level 2 included village characteristics. Results: Based on the new WHO growth reference, a major proportion of children were stunted (52.9 %), wasted (22.9 %) and under-weight (46.5 %). In a two-level model, compared to boys, girls had significantly greater risk of stunting [Prevalence Ratio (PR) (95 % C.I.) = 1.18 (1.03, 1.36)] and under-weight [P.R. (95 % C.I.) 1.14 (1.03, 1.26)], after adjustment of maternal literacy and village variables. Risk of wasting did not differ with gender [P.R. (95 % C.I.) = 1.04 (0.99, 1.15)]. Mothers of stunted and underweight children were respectively, 21 and 20 % more likely to be illiterate than those of normally nourished children. Sick children were at 16 % greater risk of wasting than those not reported ill. Conclusion: Greater prevalence of stunting and under-weight among girls suggests adoption of a gender sensitive approach in nutritional intervention programmes. Prompt management of childhood illnesses may reduce prevalence of wasting. Better literacy among rural mothers may reduce prevalence of stunting and under-weight.

Poor-to-fair health status and annual household income are instrumented using a proxy for intelligence, a temporal version of the classic distance instrument, and the average health status of individuals who are demographically similar but geographically separated. Instrument validity is evaluated. Principal Findings Moving from good/excellent health to poor/fair health (1 year of lower health status) is equivalent to the loss of $41,654 of equivalized household income (2010 constant dollars) per annum, which is larger than median equivalized household income.

Analyses of linguistic markers suggested public tweeters used more cognitive complexity in their language than private tweeters.

Parallel versions can be identified for intergender relations. Scales to measure all four ideologies are developed both for ethnicity (Studies 1 and 2) and gender (Studies 3 and 4).

In our experiment, professors were contacted by fictional prospective students seeking to discuss research opportunities prior to applying to a doctoral program.

We found that when considering requests from prospective students seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to White males than to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions.

1087,"© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.Background: Nearly one-half of Guatemalan children experience growth faltering, more so in indigenous than in nonindigenous children. Objectives: On the basis of ethnographic interviews in Totonicapán, Guatemala, which revealed differences in maternal perceptions about food needs in infant girls and boys, we predicted a cumulative sex difference in favor of girls that occurred at w6 mo of age and diminished markedly thereafter. We examined whether the predicted differences in age-sex patterns were observed in the village, replicated the examination nationally for indigenous children, and examined whether the pattern in nonindigenous children was different. Design: Ethnographic interviews (n = 24) in an indigenous village were conducted. Anthropometric measurements of the village children aged 0-35 mo (n = 119) were obtained. National-level growth patterns were analyzed for indigenous (n = 969) and nonindigenous (n = 1374) children aged 0-35 mo with the use of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data. Results: Mothers reported that, compared with female infants, male infants were hungrier, were not as satisfied with breastfeeding alone, and required earlier complementary feeding. An anthropometric analysis confirmed the prediction of healthier growth in indigenous girls than in indigenous boys throughout the first year of life, which resulted in a 2.98-cm height-for-age difference (HAD) between sexes in the village and a 1.61-cm HAD (P < 0.001) in the DHS data between 6 and 17 mo of age in favor of girls. In both data sets, the growth sex differences diminished in the second year of life (P < 0.05). No such pattern was seen in nonindigenous children. Conclusions: We propose that the differences in the HAD that first favor girls and then favor boys in the indigenous growth patterns are due to feeding patterns on the basis of gendered cultural perceptions.

Using data from the US Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten (ECLS-K; N = 10,115), we apply an intersectionality approach to examine inequalities across eighthgrade outcomes at the intersection of six racial/ethnic and gender groups (Latino girls and boys, Black girls and boys, and White girls and boys) and four classes of socioeconomic advantage/disadvantage. Results of mixture models show large inequalities in socioemotional outcomes (internalizing behavior, locus of control, and self-concept) across classes of advantage/disadvantage. Within classes of advantage/disadvantage, racial/ethnic and gender inequalities are predominantly found in the most advantaged class, where Black boys and girls, and Latina girls, underperform White boys in academic assessments, but not in socioemotional outcomes. In these latter outcomes, Black boys and girls perform better than White boys. Latino boys show small differences as compared to White boys, mainly in science assessments. The contrasting outcomes between racial/ethnic and gender minorities in self-assessment and socioemotional outcomes, as compared to standardized assessments, highlight the detrimental effect that intersecting racial/ethnic and gender discrimination have in patterning academic outcomes that predict success in adult life.

We propose a model of gender discrimination in HR that emphasizes the reciprocal nature of gender inequalities within organizations. We suggest that gender discrimination in HR-related decision-making and in the enactment of HR practices stems from gender inequalities in broader organizational structures, processes, and practices. This includes leadership, structure, strategy, culture, organizational climate, as well as HR policies. In addition, organizational decision makers’ levels of sexism can affect their likelihood of making gender biased HR-related decisions and/or behaving in a sexist manner while enacting HR practices. Importantly, institutional discrimination in organizational structures, processes, and practices play a pre-eminent role because not only do they affect HR practices, they also provide a socializing context for organizational decision makers’ levels of hostile and benevolent sexism.

Others claim that China's ‘1.5-child’ loophole, common throughout rural areas, reinforces son preference or intensifies prenatal sex discrimination by hardening fertility constraints. These claims defy logic upon closer examination. Moreover, almost two-thirds of the exceptional distortion of the sex ratio in 1.5-child areas results from excess underreporting of daughters and enforced sex-specific stopping. Prenatal sex selection may explain the remaining third but probably reflects the stronger rural son preference that led to the 1.5-child loophole itself. The recent surge in sex selection of first births that has perpetuated the distortions also seems unrelated to policy. Some son-preferring parents who formerly wanted two children may now genuinely want only one.",2015-09-02,Journal,Article,Population Studies,27392,14,69,The claim that China’s fertility restrictions contributed to the use of prenatal sex selection: A sceptical reappraisal,0,false,10.1080/00324728.2015.1103565,Routledge,1097,L’Année psychologique,2015.0,50.0,0.0,,113843184,Anne-Laure Hernandez,5572627,Sandrine Redersdorff,6952918,D.

The study concludes that women's perceptions of and attitudes towards breast cancer and its treatment are influenced by a myriad of economic and socio-cultural factors, which practitioners need to take into account when planning public health initiatives. There are a number of economic challenges facing breast cancer education and awareness programmes due to a lack of adequate numbers of specialized health personnel and breast cancer screening facilities in the district.

I argue that the DSM became a site where women attempted to tease out issues relating to gender, professionalization, and the power and stakes of labeling. Feminists privileged a sociological reading of gender, which butted up against mental health care workers' professional investment in psychiatric ones. Women's responses to the DSM, however, reveal that the line between the sociological and the pathological was unclear. This debate over labels is exemplified by a proposal to diagnose rapists as mentally ill. Women's advocates framed sexual assault as an issue of violence against women, rather than an issue of male sexuality. For many women, the American Psychiatric Association's proposal implied that rape was a primarily sexual act, and that male socialization needn't be examined. Others, however, saw this as one more way to label and address bad male behavior; psychiatric treatment might not ultimately put an end to rape, but these women saw any sort of treatment as a step forward.

1108,"© 2014 American Psychological Association.Objective: In the U.S., young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, with YMSM of color being the most impacted by the epidemic. Method: To advance prevention research, we examined race-based differences in gay-related stress in conjunction with the moderating role of mental health on substance use and sexual risk among 206 high-risk YMSM, recruited September, 2007-2010. Results: Negative binomial regressions and 3-way interaction graphs indicated that psychological distress and acute gay-related stigma placed all participants at most risk for HIV acquisition. Low psychological distress appeared to ""buffer"" all YMSM against HIV risk, whereas the reverse was evidenced for those reporting low gay-related stigma and psychological distress. YMSM of color reported more risk behavior, and less decreases in risk with attenuated psychological distress, compared with White YMSM. We hypothesize these trends to be associated with experiencing multiple stigmatized identities, indicating points of intervention for YMSM of color to achieve positive identity integration. There were sharper increases in HIV risk behavior for White YMSM with increasing gay-related stigma than for YMSM of color, which could be attributed to the latter's prolonged exposure to discrimination necessitating building coping skills to manage the influx of adversity. Conclusions: Emphases on: (a) identity-based interventions for YMSM of color; and (b) skills-based interventions for White YMSM should supplement existing successful HIV risk-reduction programs.

The proposers' identity was manipulated using occupational role nouns stereotypically marked with gender (e.g., Teacher; Engineer), paired with either feminine or masculine proper names (e.g., Anna; David). Greater FRN amplitudes reflected the early processing of the conflict between the strategic rule (i.e., earning as much money as possible) and ready-to-go responses (i.e., refusing unequal offers and discriminating proposers according to their stereotype). Responders were found to rely on a dual-process system (i.e., automatic and heuristic-based system 1 vs. cognitively costly and deliberative system 2), the P300 amplitude reflecting the switch from a decision making system to another. Greater P300 amplitudes were found in response to both fair and unfair offers and male-stereotyped proposers' offers reflecting an automatic decision making based on heuristics, while lower P300 amplitudes were found in response to 3€ offers and the female-stereotyped proposers' offers reflecting a more deliberative reasoning.

We expect anti-immigrant attitudes to be more strongly predicted by feelings of insecurity or representations of men and women as strong and fragile when individuals are exposed to sexual threat cues than when they are not. Results from two online experiments conducted in Switzerland and Germany largely confirmed these assumptions. Comparing two anti-immigrant posters (general and non-sexual threat vs. sexual threat), Experiment 1 (n = 142) showed that feelings of insecurity were related to an increased support for expelling immigrants from the host country in both cases. However, only in the sexual threat cues condition and among female participants, were perceptions of women as fragile—as measured with benevolent sexism items—related to support for expelling immigrants. Further distinguishing between different forms of violence threat cues, Experiment 2 (n = 181) showed that collective feelings of insecurity were most strongly related to support for expelling immigrants when a male immigrant was presented as a violent criminal. In contrast, benevolent sexist beliefs were related to anti-immigrant stances only when participants were exposed to a depiction of a male immigrant as a rapist. In both cases attitudes were polarized: on the one hand, representations of immigrants as criminals provoked reactance reactions—that is, more positive attitudes—among participants scoring low in insecurity feelings or benevolent sexism. On the other hand, those scoring high in these dimensions expressed slightly more negative attitudes.

Results generally supported theoretical predictions regarding the moderating impact of bystander gender on the relationship between ambient sexism and bystander well-being. As hypothesized, ambient hostile sexism more negatively impacted female bystanders than male bystanders with regard to performance-based state self-esteem. Performance-based self-esteem in turn predicted career aspirations such that lower performance-based state self-esteem predicted lower career aspirations: gender moderated this mediated relationship such that the indirect effect was more negative for female bystanders than male bystanders. Gender also moderated the relationship between ambient benevolent sexism and appearance-based state self-esteem. Women observing benevolent sexism tended to report enhanced appearance-based esteem relative to women in the hostile sexism and control conditions, whereas men observing benevolent sexism reported significantly lower appearance esteem than men in the hostile sexism and control conditions.

1113,"© 2015 Ahmad et al.Background: Marine fishing communities are among the most marginalised and hard-to-reach groups and have been largely neglected in health research. We examined the quality of cataract surgery and its determinants, with an emphasis on gender, in marine fishing communities in Karachi, Pakistan, using multiple indicators of performance. Methods and Findings: The Karachi Marine Fishing Communities Eye and General Health Survey was a door-todoor, cross-sectional study conducted between March 2009 and April 2010 in fishing communities living on 7 islands and in coastal areas in Keamari, Karachi, located on the Arabian Sea. A population-based sample of 638 adults, aged ≥ 50 years, was studied. A total of 145 eyes (of 97 persons) had undergone cataract surgery in this sample. Cataract surgical outcomes assessed included vision (presenting and best-corrected with a reduced logMAR chart), satisfaction with surgery, astigmatism, and pupil shape. Overall, 65.5% of the operated eyes had some form of visual loss (presenting visual acuity [PVA] < 6/12). 55.2%, 29.0%, and 15.9% of these had good, borderline, and poor visual outcomes based on presenting vision; with best correction, these values were: 68.3%, 18.6%, and 13.1%, respectively. Of 7 covariates evaluated in the multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEE) analyses, gender was the only significant independent predictor of visual outcome. Women's eyes were nearly 4.38 times more likely to have suboptimal visual outcome (PVA<6/18) compared with men's eyes (adjusted odds ratio 4.38, 95% CI 1.96-9.79; P<0.001) after adjusting for the effect of household financial status. A higher proportion ofwomen's than men's eyes had an irregular pupil (26.5% vs. 14.8%) or severe/very severe astigmatism (27.5% vs. 18.2%). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Overall, more than one fourth (44/144) of cataract surgeries resulted in dissatisfaction. The only significant predictor of satisfaction was visual outcome (P <0.001). Conclusions: The quality of cataract surgery in this marginalised population, especially among women, falls well below the WHO recommended standards. Gender disparities, in particular, deserve proactive attention in policy, service delivery, research and evaluation.

1115,"BACKGROUND: Management of malignant bone and soft tissue tumors remains an overwhelming confront to orthopedic surgeons. The challenge is discriminating in developing countries due to inadequate diagnostic and therapeutic amenities and unawareness. A lot has been discussed about the neglected orthopedic trauma, but the published literature on the causes and management of neglected bone and soft tissue tumors is sparse. Hence, current study was undertaken to highlight the causes of neglect and therapeutic challenges for managing these neglected tumors in developing countries. AIMS and Objectives: To determine the causes of neglect of malignant bone and soft tissue tumors, their epidemiology (including their relative frequencies, age, gender discrimination, anatomical sites of occurrence and histological characteristics) and difficult aspect of management due to neglect or delayed presentation. MATERIALS and METHODS: This was an appraisal of the neglected malignant bone and soft tissue tumors presented to J. N. Medical College and Hospital from June 2008 to May 2013. Criteria for labeling the tumor as neglected malignant bone and soft tissue tumor was delayed presentation (>3 months), locally advanced disease, ulceration, sepsis, fungating mass or metastasis at the time of presentation. All the cases were reviewed and analyzed for age, gender, histological types, educational status and socioeconomic status of the family, any prior treatment by traditional bone setters or registered medical practitioner, cause of delay for seeking medical advice. We have also analyzed the treatment given at our institute and the outcome of the tumor. OBSERVATIONS and Results: Eighteen patients fulfilled the criteria for neglected malignant bone and soft tissue tumors, hence were included in study. Eight cases were of osteosarcoma, five cases were of Ewing's sarcoma, three cases were of chondrosarcoma and 1 case each was of pleomorphic liposarcoma and primary lymphoma of bone. According to Enneking staging system 11 cases were of stage III (distant metastasis) and 7 were stage II-B. Seven were females, and 11 were males. Age range was 5-68 years. 15 patients (83.3%) belonged to low socioeconomic status with 17 patients (94.4%) belonged to uneducated background. Cause of delay in seeking medical advice was neglect by the patient and family due to financial constraints, cultural and religious believes, lack of access to health care facilities, consultation with traditional bone setters and even misdiagnosis by qualified orthopedic surgeons. The tumors included were all unresectable and of huge sizes, hence were managed with amputation/dis-articulation, chemotherapy or radiation.

1117,"© 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.The aim of the present study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the gender distribution of first and senior authorships in important oral and maxillofacial journals over the 30-year period from 1980 to 2010. Articles published in three representative oral and maxillofacial surgery journals were selected. The years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 were chosen as representative points in time for article selection. Original research, case reports, technical notes, and reviews were included in the analysis. Case reports and technical notes were pooled in one group. For each article, the gender of the first author as well as that of the senior author was determined, based on the inspection of their first name. The type of article was determined and the country of origin of the article was documented. A total 1412 articles were subjected to the data analysis.

We examine several possible reasons for the gap using the Chinese SAGE data. We first rule out differential reporting by gender as a possible explanation, exploiting information on anchoring vignettes in eight domains of health functioning. Decomposing the gap in general self-assessed health, we find that about 31% can be explained by socio-demographic factors, most of all by discrimination against women in education in the 20th century. A more complete specification including chronic conditions and health functioning fully explains the remainder of the gap (about 69%). Adding chronic conditions and health functioning also explains at least two thirds of the education contribution, suggesting how education may affect health.

Although, currently evidence suggests impaired second order configural processing, more studies are necessary to determine whether or not holistic processing is impaired in schizophrenia patients. Neural and neurophysiological evidence suggests impaired earlier levels of visual processing, which might involve the deficits in interaction of the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways impacting on further processing.

All rights reserved.Neurons that respond more to images of faces over nonface objects were identified in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of primates three decades ago. Although it is hypothesized that perceptual discrimination between faces depends on the neural activity of IT subregions enriched with ""face neurons,"" such a causal link has not been directly established. Here, using optogenetic and pharmacological methods, we reversibly suppressed the neural activity in small subregions of IT cortex of macaque monkeys performing a facial gender-discrimination task. Each type of intervention independently demonstrated that suppression of IT subregions enriched in face neurons induced a contralateral deficit in face gender-discrimination behavior.

1128,"© 2015 Hu et al.; licensee BioMed Central.Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by significant impairment in reciprocal social interactions and communication coupled with stereotyped, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Although genomic and functional studies are beginning to reveal some of the genetic complexity and underlying pathobiology of ASD, the consistently reported male bias of ASD remains an enigma. We have recently proposed that retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA), which is reduced in the brain and lymphoblastoid cell lines of multiple cohorts of individuals with ASD and oppositely regulated by male and female hormones, might contribute to the sex bias in autism by differentially regulating target genes, including CYP19A1 (aromatase), in a sex-dependent manner that can also lead to elevated testosterone levels, a proposed risk factor for autism. Methods: In this study, we examine sex differences in RORA and aromatase protein levels in cortical tissues of unaffected and affected males and females by re-analyzing pre-existing confocal immunofluorescence data from our laboratory. We further investigated the expression of RORA and its correlation with several of its validated transcriptional targets in the orbital frontal cortex and cerebellum as a function of development using RNAseq data from the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain. In a pilot study, we also analyzed the expression of Rora and the same transcriptional targets in the cortex and cerebellum of adult wild-type male and female C57BL/6 mice. Results: Our findings suggest that Rora/RORA and several of its transcriptional targets may exhibit sexually dimorphic expression in certain regions of the brain of both mice and humans. Interestingly, the correlation coefficients between Rora expression and that of its targets are much higher in the cortex of male mice relative to that of female mice. A strong positive correlation between the levels of RORA and aromatase proteins is also seen in the cortex of control human males and females as well as ASD males, but not ASD females. Conclusions: Based on these studies, we suggest that disruption of Rora/RORA expression may have a greater impact on males, since sex differences in the correlation of RORA and target gene expression indicate that RORA-deficient males may experience greater dysregulation of genes relevant to ASD in certain brain regions during development.",2015-05-13,Journal,Article,Molecular Autism,19700177555,48,6,Investigation of sex differences in the expression of RORA and its transcriptional targets in the brain as a potential contributor to the sex bias in autism,1,true,10.1186/2040-2392-6-7,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,1128,,2016.0,74.0,5.0,,5666180,M.

Across 4 studies, results provided support for this new measure's reliability and validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided support for a hierarchical model with a superordinate factor (masculinity contingency) and 2 factors that correspond to 2 subscales: MCS-Threat (self-worth is threatened by a lack of masculinity) and MCS-Boost (self-worth is boosted by confirmation of masculinity). Evidence for good reliability was demonstrated by high alpha coefficients and test-retest reliability. Evidence for convergent, discriminant, criterion-related, and incremental validity was demonstrated by testing the associations between the MCS and existing masculinity measures, sexism measures, homophobia, and trait self-esteem.

1130,"© 2014 Taylor & Francis.High rates of cigarette smoking have been observed among HIV-positive individuals. Smoking has been linked to HIV-related medical complications and non-AIDS defining cancers and negatively impacts on immune function and virologic control. Although internalized heterosexism has been related to smoking behaviors, little is known about associations between partners' reports of smoking, internalized heterosexism, and HIV medication management in male couples with HIV. A sample of 266 male couples completed baseline assessments for a cohort study examining relationship factors and HIV treatment. A computer-based survey assessed self-reported smoking behaviors, alcohol use, internalized heterosexism, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. HIV-positive men also provided blood samples to assess viral load. Approximately 30% of the sample reported that they are currently smoking cigarettes. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, men in a primary relationship with a partner who reported currently smoking had more than five-fold greater odds of reporting smoking. Higher levels of internalized heterosexism and financial hardship were each independently associated with greater odds of reporting smoking. Among HIV-positive men on ART (n = 371), having a partner who reported smoking was associated with almost three-fold greater odds of having a detectable viral load.

Participants reported experiences of weight discrimination in everyday life and completed measures of quality of life (CASP-19 scale), life satisfaction (Satisfaction With Life Scale), and depressive symptoms (eight-item CES-D scale). Height and weight were objectively measured, with obesity defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2.

Results Obesity, weight discrimination, and psychological well-being were all significantly inter-related. Mediation models revealed significant indirect effects of obesity through perceived weight discrimination on quality of life (β=-0.072, SE=0.008), life satisfaction (β=-0.038, SE=0.008), and depressive symptoms (β=0.057, SE=0.008), with perceived weight discrimination explaining approximately 40% (range: 39.5-44.1%) of the total association between obesity and psychological well-being.

1132,"© , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Understanding factors related to condom use is critical in reducing the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially for women, who are disproportionately affected by many STIs. Extant work has shown that perceived sexism is one such factor associated with lower levels of condom use among women, but has yet to explore whether benevolent sexism in particular—a subtle form of sexism that often goes unnoticed and increases cognitions and behaviors consistent with traditional female gender roles (e.g., sexual submissiveness)—relates negatively to this safer-sex practice. The present research tested this possibility and, in addition, examined whether relational sex motives, which reflect a desire to engage in sex as a means to foster partners’ sexual satisfaction, mediated the relation between benevolent sexism and condom use. During the spring of 2011, female college students (N = 158) reported how often they experienced benevolent sexism in their daily lives and, 2 weeks later, their relational sex motives and condom use. Supporting hypotheses results indicated that greater exposure to benevolent sexism was associated significantly with lower condom use, and that relational sex motives mediated this relationship.

Patients and Methods: Six hundred two patients with type 2 diabetes from two adult primary care clinics in the southeastern United States completed validated questionnaires. Questions included perceived discrimination because of race/ethnicity, level of education, sex/gender, or language. A multiple linear regression model assessed the differential effect of each type of perceived discrimination on glycemic control while adjusting for relevant covariates, including race, site, gender, marital status, duration of diabetes, number of years in school, number of hours worked per week, income, and health status. Results: The mean age was 61.5 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 12.3 years. Of the sample, 61.6% were men, and 64.9% were non-Hispanic black.

This so called stereotype threat effect can contribute to systematic group differences in performance that can obscure the true abilities of certain social groups and thereby sustain social inequalities. In the present study, we examined processes underlying stereotype threat effects on women's math performance, specifically focusing on the role of suppression of mind wandering (i.e., task-irrelevant thinking) in stereotype threat (ST) and no threat (NT) situations. Based on a process model of stereotype threat effects on performance, we hypothesized that women under stereotype threat spontaneously suppress mind wandering, and that this suppression impairs performance. An alternative regulation strategy that prevents suppression (i.e., reappraising task-irrelevant thoughts as normal) was predicted to prevent stereotype threat effects on performance. We manipulated stereotype threat (ST vs. NT) and cognitive regulation strategy (suppression, reappraisal, or no strategy) and measured women's performance on a math and a concentration task (N = 113).We expected three groups to perform relatively more poorly: Those in ST with either no strategy or suppression and those in NT with a suppression strategy. We tested the performance of these groups against the remaining three groups hypothesized to perform relatively better: those in NT with no strategy or reappraisal and those in ST with reappraisal. The results showed the expected pattern for participants' math performance, but not for concentration achievement.

Results indicated that males exposed to models and cues of traditional masculinity showed significantly increased levels of dysfunctional sexual beliefs and traditional sexual attitudes relative to males exposed to models of modern masculinity.

Our study tested endorsement of marriage myths and benevolent sexism as predictors of engaged heterosexual college women’s premarital relationship outcomes and psychological well-being. Women in heterosexual relationships (N = 99) completed an online questionnaire 6–12 months before their wedding. Results indicated endorsement of marriage myths predicted positive experiences, whereas benevolent sexism predicted negative experiences. However, several interactions indicated that women who rejected marriage myths but endorsed benevolent sexism showed more negative patterns including lower relationship satisfaction and confidence, lower educational expectations, and higher depression. Results are interpreted using self-discrepancy theory such that when actual and ideal experiences are congruent, higher relationship satisfaction and more positive well-being results, whereas discrepant actual–ideal experiences predict dissatisfaction and more negative well-being. These results have implications for counseling couples on holding realistic expectations for their romantic partners.

1144,"© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.This research investigates whether ambivalent sexism impacts individuals’ perceptions of what is appropriate and valued dating behavior, as these perceptions may contribute to the perpetuation of traditional dating scripts. Two hundred seventeen undergraduate students from the Midwestern United States read a gender-stereotypic, gender-counter stereotypic, or egalitarian heterosexual dating vignette. Participants made judgments of appropriateness, warmth, and competence separately for the man and woman on the date. Overall, gender stereotypic dates were evaluated most positively, consistent with previous work suggesting that dating behaviors remain gendered. Evidence of the restrictive nature of the masculine gender role was obtained. Men in egalitarian and counter-stereotypic dating scenarios were evaluated negatively in terms of warmth, competence, and appropriateness, thus potentially experiencing backlash effects. Indeed, the man in the gender counter-stereotypic condition was rated as less competent, warm, and appropriate than the women, but the man in the gender stereotypic condition was rated as more competent, warm, and appropriate than the woman. Consistent with predictions, those high in ambivalent sexism had more negative reactions to gender counter-stereotypic dating scenarios than those low in ambivalent sexism. However, ambivalent sexism did not predict different reactions towards gender stereotypic and egalitarian dating scenarios, and egalitarian dates were rated as most typical regardless of participants’ ambivalent sexism. Thus, greater acceptance of gender counter-stereotypic dates was observed among those low in ambivalent sexism, and even those high in ambivalent sexism were accepting of egalitarian dating practices.",2015-03-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,12,72,Perceptions of Dating Behavior: The Role of Ambivalent Sexism,0,false,10.1007/s11199-015-0460-6,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,1144,Sex Roles,2015.0,0.0,0.0,,6760964,J.

1145,"© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.This study examined the nonverbal and verbal expressions of hostile and benevolent sexism. Hostile sexism is sexist antipathy and benevolent sexism is a chivalrous belief that women are warm yet incompetent. We predicted that hostile sexist men would display less affiliative expressions but benevolent sexist men would display more affiliative expressions during mixed-gender interactions. Twenty-seven pairs of U.S. male and female undergraduates from a private university in New England participated in this study. These mixed-gender dyads participated in two social interactions: a structured trivia game followed by an unstructured conversation period. During the trivia game, men with more benevolent sexism were perceived to be more patient overall when waiting for the woman to answer the trivia questions. Furthermore, we examined the men’s nonverbal and verbal expressions during the unstructured interaction—naïve raters made impression ratings of the men’s nonverbal and verbal behavior, and trained coders counted the frequency of specific nonverbal cues (e.g., smiles). A word count software was used for verbal content analysis. As predicted, more hostile sexism was associated with less affiliative nonverbal and verbal expressions (e.g., less approachable, less friendly, and less smiling), but more benevolent sexism was associated with more affiliative nonverbal and verbal expressions (e.g., more approachable, more likely to smile, and more positive word usage).

1147,"PURPOSE: Despite sincere commitment to egalitarian, meritocratic principles, subtle gender bias persists, constraining women's opportunities for academic advancement. The authors implemented a pair-matched, single-blind, cluster randomized, controlled study of a gender-bias-habit-changing intervention at a large public university. METHOD: Participants were faculty in 92 departments or divisions at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Between September 2010 and March 2012, experimental departments were offered a gender-bias-habit-changing intervention as a 2.5-hour workshop. Surveys measured gender bias awareness; motivation, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations to reduce bias; and gender equity action. A timed word categorization task measured implicit gender/leadership bias. Faculty completed a work-life survey before and after all experimental departments received the intervention. Control departments were offered workshops after data were collected. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models showed significantly greater changes post intervention for faculty in experimental versus control departments on several outcome measures, including self-efficacy to engage in gender-equity-promoting behaviors (P = .013). When ≥ 25% of a department's faculty attended the workshop (26 of 46 departments), significant increases in self-reported action to promote gender equity occurred at three months (P = .007). Post intervention, faculty in experimental departments expressed greater perceptions of fit (P = .024), valuing of their research (P = .019), and comfort in raising personal and professional conflicts (P = .025).

1149,"© 2014 Elsevier Inc.This article is part of a Special Issue ""Chemosignals and Reproduction"".Many lizards have diverse glands that produce chemosignals used in intraspecific communication and that can have reproductive consequences. For example, information in chemosignals of male lizards can be used in intrasexual competition to identify and assess the fighting potential or dominance status of rival males either indirectly through territorial scent-marks or during agonistic encounters. Moreover, females of several lizard species ""prefer"" to establish or spend more time on areas scent-marked by males with compounds signaling a better health or body condition or a higher genetic compatibility, which can have consequences for their mating success and inter-sexual selection processes. We review here recent studies that suggest that the information content of chemosignals of lizards may be reliable because several physiological and endocrine processes would regulate the proportions of chemical compounds available for gland secretions. Because chemosignals are produced by the organism or come from the diet, they should reflect physiological changes, such as different hormonal levels (e.g. testosterone or corticosterone) or different health states (e.g. parasitic infections, immune response), and reflect the quality of the diet of an individual. More importantly, some compounds that may function as chemosignals also have other important functions in the organism (e.g. as antioxidants or regulating the immune system), so there could be trade-offs between allocating these compounds to attending physiological needs or to produce costly sexual ""chemical ornaments"". All these factors may contribute to maintain chemosignals as condition-dependent sexual signals, which can inform conspecifics on the characteristics and state of the sender and allow making behavioral decisions with reproductive consequences. To understand the evolution of chemical secretions of lizards as sexual signals and their relevance in reproduction, future studies should examine what information the signals are carrying, the physiological processes that can maintain the reliability of the message and how diverse behavioral responses to chemosignals may influence reproductive success.",2015-02-01,Journal,Review,Hormones and Behavior,26133,58,68,Condition-dependent chemosignals in reproductive behavior of lizards,2,,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2014.06.009,Academic Press Inc.apjcs@harcourt.com,1149,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,2015.0,81.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'To effectively address substance use among trans*female youth, efforts must address coping related to gender-based discrimination and trauma, and structural level interventions aiming to reduce stigma and gender-identity discrimination might also be effective.'}",2112104859,Chris Rowe,48968430,G.

1150,"© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Background: Substance use is highly prevalent among transgender (trans*) females and has been associated with negative health outcomes, including HIV infection. Little is known about psychosocial risk factors that may influence the onset of substance use among trans*female youth, which can contribute to health disparities during adulthood. Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of a study on HIV risk and resilience among trans*female youth (N= 292). Prevalence of substance use was assessed and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, gender-related discrimination, parental drug or alcohol problems (PDAP) and multiple substance use outcomes. Results: Most (69%) of the trans*female youth reported recent drug use. In multivariable analyses, those with PTSD had increased odds of drug use [AOR = 1.94 (95% CI = 1.09-3.44)]. Those who experienced gender-related discrimination had increased odds of drug use [AOR = 2.28 (95% CI = 1.17-4.44)], drug use concurrent with sex [AOR = 2.35 (95% CI = 1.11-4.98)] and use of multiple drugs [AOR = 3.24 (95% CI = 1.52-6.88)]. Those with psychological distress had increased odds of using multiple heavy drugs [AOR = 2.27 (95% CI = 1.01-5.12)].

1151,"© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.The present research examined how differences in attachment style might impact women's awareness of sexism. Identity threat models of stigma emphasize the role of individual differences in responding to social identity threats, however little is known about what factors lead to avoidance versus vigilance for such threats. Furthermore, research shows that insecure attachment is related to avoidant responses to blatantly threatening cues, but vigilance when such cues are ambiguous. Thus, insecurely attached women should acknowledge less sexism toward women when faced with instances of blatant sexism, whereas their awareness should be heightened by instances of ambiguous sexism. Conversely, securely attached women should acknowledge sexism when encountering blatant rather than ambiguous instances of sexism. In a test of these hypotheses, 155 women were exposed to either a male verbally rejecting a women's opinion for blatantly sexist or ambiguously sexist reasons. The data confirm predictions.

1152,"© 2014 The Authors.Pattern recognition applied to whole-brain neuroimaging data, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has proved successful at discriminating psychiatric patients from healthy participants. However, predictive patterns obtained from whole-brain voxel-based features are difficult to interpret in terms of the underlying neurobiology. Many psychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, are thought to be brain connectivity disorders. Therefore, pattern recognition based on network models might provide deeper insights and potentially more powerful predictions than whole-brain voxel-based approaches. Here, we build a novel sparse network-based discriminative modeling framework, based on Gaussian graphical models and L1-norm regularized linear Support Vector Machines (SVM). In addition, the proposed framework is optimized in terms of both predictive power and reproducibility/stability of the patterns. Our approach aims to provide better pattern interpretation than voxel-based whole-brain approaches by yielding stable brain connectivity patterns that underlie discriminative changes in brain function between the groups. We illustrate our technique by classifying patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy participants, in two (event- and block-related) fMRI datasets acquired while participants performed a gender discrimination and emotional task, respectively, during the visualization of emotional valent faces.",2015-01-05,Journal,Article,NeuroImage,17495,125,105,Sparse network-based models for patient classification using fMRI,1,true,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.11.021,Academic Press Inc.apjcs@harcourt.com,1152,,2015.0,76.0,3.0,,34883936,R.

1158,"© 2014 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.Psychological violence against women in intimate relations is one of the most widespread and hidden ways of limiting their human rights. Nowadays different ideologies, including sexism and feminism, can contribute to (dis)regard this phenomenon. This study focuses on the relationship between ambivalent sexism (in its hostile and benevolent dimensions) and feminism (in the egalitarian ideology dimension) with the identification of psychological violence and the perception of invulnerability to the intimate partner violence in women. The mediator role of the myths about genderbased violence in these relationships is analysed. Participants were 91 women, with heterogeneous socio-demographic characteristics. Results showed benevolent sexism as a risk factor and egalitarian feminism ideology as a protector factor in the process of the perception of psychological violence.

1159,"© 2015 Stein and Illes.The global burden of disorders has shifted from infectious disease to non-communicable diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Whereas infectious disease can sometimes be combated by targeting single causal mechanisms, such as prevention of contact-spread illness by handwashing, in the case of mental disorders multiple causal mechanisms are typically relevant. The emergent field of global mental health has emphasized the magnitude of the treatment gap, particularly in the low- and middle-income world and has paid particular attention to upstream causal factors, for example, poverty, inequality, and gender discrimination in the pathogenesis of mental disorders. However, this field has also been criticized for relying erroneously on Western paradigms of mental illness, which may not be relevant or appropriate to the low- and middle-income context. Here, it is important to steer a path between scientism and skepticism. Scientism regards mental disorders as essential categories, and takes a covering law approach to causality; skepticism regards mental disorders as merely social constructions and emphasizes the role of political power in causal relations. We propose an integrative model that emphasizes the contribution of a broad range of causal mechanisms operating at biological and societal levels to mental disorders and the consequent importance of broad spectrum and multipronged approaches to intervention.",2015-01-01,Journal,Short Survey,Frontiers in Psychiatry,21100216569,8,6,Beyond scientism and skepticism: An integrative approach to global mental health,1,true,10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00166,Frontiers Research Foundationinfo@frontiersin.org,1159,,2014.0,0.0,0.0,,117087974,B.

1162,"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.One way in which sexism is distinct from many other types of prejudice is its ubiquitous and ambivalent nature. Women are either revered or reviled, depending on whether they fulfill or violate expectations concerning their gender roles. Ambivalent sexism theory describes the underlying ideologies and the varied consequences of such ambivalent attitudes. Although the distinction into hostile and benevolent attitudes seems to be universal, the content of the dimensions, developed mainly with white middle-class US student samples, might be inadequate when applied to other groups and cultures. The aim of this chapter is to show aspects of sexism not included in AST but relevant in groups with different economic, cultural, and historical backgrounds. We focus on Poland, where gender attitudes have been influenced by a unique blend of romantic models and patriotic sentiments, Catholic Church teachings, the sociocultural legacy of communism, and, most recently, the rapid system transformation. We distinguish three additional springboards for sexism: (1) the conviction that the fundamental role of a woman is that of the mother (together with the assumption that women’s goals should be subsumed under others’ goals and needs); (2) the responsibility for aesthetics that is placed upon women; and (3) a belief in women’s resourcefulness. These basic tenets form a richer structure of prejudice not encapsulated by the sub-dimensions of AST and, as we will argue, are of substantial importance for the everyday lives of women and the maintenance of the gender hierarchy in society at large.",2015-01-01,Book,Book Chapter,Psychology of Gender Through the Lens of Culture: Theories and Applications,21100416231,12,,A broader conceptualization of sexism: The case of Poland,0,false,10.1007/978-3-319-14005-6_9,Springer International Publishing,1162,Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease,2015.0,18.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Sex bias in the classification of borderline and narcissistic personality disorders is present and is influenced by base-rate variation, emphasizing the need for caution in classifying personality disorders, especially borderline or narcissistic traits.'}",4883072,Wouter Braamhorst,3487749,J.

Social dominance orientation assesses beliefs about the desirability of group hierarchies and predicts social attitudes such as ethnocentrism. The stereotype content model maps societal groups' stereotypes, based on perceived social structure, predicting emotional prejudices and discriminatory tendencies. Recent racism measures tap modern policy-related attitude configurations, relatively automatic associations between groups and evaluations, and indirect indicators of intergroup attitudes.

1165,"© 2015 INFORMS.This paper investigates how professional workers' willingness to act with interpersonal sensitivity is influenced by the gender and power of their interaction partners. We call into question the idea that mixed-gender interactions involve more interpersonal sensitivity than all-male interactions primarily because women demonstrate more interpersonal sensitivity than do men. Rather, we argue that the social category ""women"" can evoke more sensitive behavior from others such that men as well as women contribute to an increase in sensitivity in mixed-gender interactions. We further argue that the presence of women may trigger increased sensitivity such that men can also be the recipients of more sensitivity when one or more women are present on a team. In a study of 202 management consultants, we found that the willingness to act with interpersonal sensitivity increased in interactions with women. Moreover, this effect was greater in interactions with women who had low reward power-i.e., females who better fit the expectations associated with the social category ""women."" We also found team-level effects. Professionals working with mixed-gender versus all-male client teams reported a greater willingness to act with interpersonally sensitive behavior toward male client team members.

DS is associated with violence (OR=2.34; IC95% 1.06-5.15), having ≥4 children, having a female baby, older age of the last child, low birth weight, food insecurity, and sexual debut <15 years old (p<0.01). Accumulated probability of DS, taking into consideration all risk factors measured, is 69.76%.

1167,"© 2014 American Psychological Association.Gender bias continues to be a concern in many work settings, leading researchers to identify factors that influence workplace decisions. In this study we examine several of these factors, using an organizing framework of sex distribution within jobs (including male- and female-dominated jobs as well as sex-balanced, or integrated, jobs). We conducted random effects meta-analyses including 136 independent effect sizes from experimental studies (N = 22,348) and examined the effects of decision-maker gender, amount and content of information available to the decision maker, type of evaluation, and motivation to make careful decisions on gender bias in organizational decisions. We also examined study characteristics such as type of participant, publication year, and study design. Our findings revealed that men were preferred for male-dominated jobs (i.e., gender-role congruity bias), whereas no strong preference for either gender was found for female-dominated or integrated jobs. Second, male raters exhibited greater gender-role congruity bias than did female raters for male-dominated jobs. Third, gender-role congruity bias did not consistently decrease when decision makers were provided with additional information about those they were rating, but gender-role congruity bias was reduced when information clearly indicated high competence of those being evaluated. Fourth, gender-role congruity bias did not differ between decisions that required comparisons among ratees and decisions made about individual ratees.

We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the originally reported effect is the result of a methodological artifact due to gender-symmetry and stimuli setup-symmetry confounds in the original stimulus set. We tested this theoretically more parsimonious account in a methodologically stricter and extended conceptual replication of the putative SO-effect. Results from two studies showed that the original stimulus set indeed suffered from symmetry confounds and that these are necessary boundary-conditions in order for the hypothetical SO-effect to occur.

Although the role of ethnicity is non-negligible in the areas where minorities are concentrated, our findings confirm the greater importance of gender over ethnicity as a source of segregation.

Polyculturalism is defined as the belief that cultures change constantly through different racial and ethnic groups’ interactions, influences, and exchanges with each other and, therefore, are dynamic and socially constructed rather than static. Thus, polyculturalism may involve openness to cultural change and, thereby, would be expected to be associated with lower sexist attitudes. Four studies (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) with undergraduate and community samples in the Northeastern United States tested whether endorsement of polyculturalism is inversely associated with sexism, above and beyond potentially confounding belief systems. Across studies, for both women and men, endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with lower sexist attitudes for two classes of sexism measures: (a) attitudes toward the rights and roles of women and (b) ambivalent sexist attitudes toward women. Associations remained significant while controlling for potentially confounding variables (colorblindness, conservatism, egalitarianism, gender and ethnic identity, gender and race essentialism, multiculturalism, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation).

Logistic regression models were constructed using SAS-Callable SUDAAN.Results Both chronic racial discrimination (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.85) and chronic non-racial discrimination (RR=1.69, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.08) predicted a higher risk of smoking, but neither type of acute discrimination did. Total (sum of racial and nonracial) chronic discrimination (RR=1.46, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.78) and total acute discrimination (RR=1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60) predicted a higher risk of current smoking.Conclusions Racial and non-racial discrimination may be related to South African adults’ smoking behaviour, but this relationship likely varies by the timing and frequency of these experiences.

1175,"© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Previous research has shown that violent video games can increase aggression in players immediately after they play. The present research examines the effects of one subtle cue within violent video games that might moderate these effects-whether the avatar is male or female. One common stereotype is that males are more aggressive than females. Thus, playing a violent video game as a male avatar, compared to a female avatar, should be more likely to prime aggressive thoughts and inclinations in players and lead to more aggressive behavior afterwards. Male and female university students (N=242) were randomly assigned to play a violent video game as a male or female avatar. After gameplay, participants gave an ostensible partner who hated spicy food hot sauce to eat. The amount of hot sauce given was used to measure aggression. Consistent with priming theory, results showed that both male and female participants who played a violent game as a male avatar behaved more aggressively afterwards than those who played as female avatar. The priming effects of the male avatar were somewhat stronger for male participants than for female participants, suggesting that male participants identified more with the male avatar than did the female participants. These results are particularly noteworthy because they are consistent with another recent experiment showing that playing a violent game as an avatar with a different stereotypically aggressive attribute (black skin color) stimulates more aggression than playing as an avatar without the stereotypically aggressive attribute (Yang et al., 2014, Social Psychological and Personality Science).",2014-11-01,Journal,Article,Aggressive Behavior,29452,17,40,Effects of playing a violent video game as male versus female avatar on subsequent aggression in male and female players,2,,10.1002/ab.21551,Wiley-Liss Inc.,1175,Genetics,2014.0,71.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This work develops a model that mechanistically examines sex-specific admixture histories and demonstrates that surprisingly, although the mean autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population does not reveal a sex bias in the admixture history, the variance of autosome admixture is informative about sex bias.'}",2061487409,Amy Goldberg,41217702,P.

1176,"© 2014 by the Genetics Society of America.Sex-biased admixture has been observed in a wide variety of admixed populations. Genetic variation in sex chromosomes and functions of quantities computed from sex chromosomes and autosomes have often been examined to infer patterns of sex-biased admixture, typically using statistical approaches that do not mechanistically model the complexity of a sex-specific history of admixture. Here, expanding on a model of Verdu and Rosenberg (2011) that did not include sex specificity, we develop a model that mechanistically examines sex-specific admixture histories. Under the model, multiple source populations contribute to an admixed population, potentially with their male and female contributions varying over time. In an admixed population descended from two source groups, we derive the moments of the distribution of the autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population as a function of sexspecific introgression parameters and time. Considering admixture processes that are constant in time, we demonstrate that surprisingly, although the mean autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population does not reveal a sex bias in the admixture history, the variance of autosomal admixture is informative about sex bias. Specifically, the long-term variance decreases as the sex bias from a contributing source population increases. This result can be viewed as analogous to the reduction in effective population size for populations with an unequal number of breeding males and females. Our approach suggests that it may be possible to use the effect of sex-biased admixture on autosomal DNA to assist with methods for inference of the history of complex sex-biased admixture processes.",2014-11-01,Journal,Article,Genetics,22173,16,198,Autosomal admixture levels are informative about sex bias in admixed populations,2,,10.1534/genetics.114.166793,Genetics Society of Americaruth.isaacson@thegsajournals.org,1176,European Journal of Pain,2014.0,40.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study aims to address challenges of under‐perception of pain can be attenuated or exacerbated with gender primes and how target gender affects nonverbal pain perception, in particular.'}",50025880,I.

Results Participants perceived lower target distress when this task was preceded by a masculine gender prime, as compared to a neutral or feminine gender prime. Pain was underestimated for all targets; however, this underestimation was significantly more pronounced for female targets.Conclusions These results suggest that gender cues may influence the perception of observed pain and, as a result, clinical decision making. They also support the conjecture that nonverbal pain cues may be under-perceived in women.Background There is ample research to support the existence of bias in the perception of others' pain. Both studies involving health-care professionals and student surrogate samples have found that, firstly, pain is under-perceived when using nonverbal cues to gauge another's suffering and, secondly, that personal characteristics of both the viewer and the target (such as gender) can bias pain perception, affecting the allocation of help.

1178,"The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has often been suggested as a key modulator of emotional stimulus appraisal and regulation. Therefore, in clinical trials, it is one of the most frequently targeted regions for non-invasive brain stimulation such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). In spite of various encouraging reports that demonstrate beneficial effects of rTMS in anxiety disorders, psychophysiological studies exploring the underlying neural mechanisms are sparse. Here we investigated how inhibitory rTMS influences early affective processing when applied over the right dlPFC. Before and after rTMS or sham stimulation, subjects viewed faces with fearful or neutral expressions while whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. Due to the disrupted functioning of the right dlPFC, visual processing in bilateral parietal, temporal, and occipital areas was amplified starting at around 90. ms after stimulus onset. Moreover, increased fear-specific activation was found in the right TPJ area in a time-interval between 110 and 170. ms. These neurophysiological effects were reflected in slowed reaction times for fearful, but not for neutral faces in a facial expression identification task while there was no such effect on a gender discrimination control task.

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that, as expected, endorsement of the toughness male role norm was positively associated with favorable attitudes toward casual sex, and endorsement of benevolent sexism was negatively associated with favorable attitudes toward casual sex. Favorable attitudes toward casual sex, in turn, were positively associated with men’s reported number of casual sex partners, as partially mediated by intoxicated sexual contact. Further, toughness endorsement was positively associated with number of casual sex partners via its positive association with intoxicated sexual contact; whereas power and status demonstrated the opposite, negative pattern.

1180,"Background: Natural variability in speech is a significant challenge to robust successful spoken word recognition. In everyday listening environments, listeners must quickly adapt and adjust to multiple sources of variability in both the signal and listening environments. High-variability speech may be particularly difficult to understand for non-native listeners, who have less experience with the second language (L2) phonological system and less detailed knowledge of sociolinguistic variation of the L2. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of high-variability sentences on nonnative speech recognition and to explore the underlying sources of individual differences in speech recognition abilities of non-native listeners. Research Design: Participants completed two sentence recognition tasks involving high-variability and low-variability sentences. They also completed a battery of behavioral tasks and self-report questionnaires designed to assess their indexical processing skills, vocabulary knowledge, and several core neurocognitive abilities. Study Sample: Native speakers of Mandarin (n = 25) living in the United States recruited from the Indiana University community participated in the current study. A native comparison group consisted of scores obtained from native speakers of English (n = 21) in the Indiana University community taken from an earlier study. Data Collection and Analysis: Speech recognition in high-variability listening conditions was assessed with a sentence recognition task using sentences from PRESTO (Perceptually Robust English Sentence Test Open-Set) mixed in 6-talker multitalker babble. Speech recognition in low-variability listening conditions was assessed using sentences fromHINT (Hearing In Noise Test) mixed in 6-talker multitalker babble. Indexical processing skills were measured using a talker discrimination task, a gender discrimination task, and a forced-choice regional dialect categorization task. Vocabulary knowledge was assessed with the WordFam word familiarity test, and executive functioning was assessed with the BRIEF-A (Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version) self-report questionnaire. Scores from the non-native listeners on behavioral tasks and self-report questionnaires were compared with scores obtained from native listeners tested in a previous study and were examined for individual differences. Results: Non-native keyword recognition scores were significantly lower on PRESTO sentences than on HINT sentences. Non-native listeners' keyword recognition scores were also lower than native listeners' scores on both sentence recognition tasks. Differences in performance on the sentence recognition tasks between non-native and native listeners were larger on PRESTO than on HINT, although group differences varied by signal-to-noise ratio. The non-native and native groups also differed in the ability to categorize talkers by region of origin and in vocabulary knowledge. Individual non-native word recognition accuracy on PRESTO sentences in multitalker babble at more favorable signal-to-noise ratios was found to be related to several BRIEF-A subscales and composite scores. However, non-native performance on PRESTO was not related to regional dialect categorization, talker and gender discrimination, or vocabulary knowledge. Conclusions: High-variability sentences in multitalker babble were particularly challenging for nonnative listeners. Difficulty under high-variability testing conditions was related to lack of experience with the L2, especially L2 sociolinguistic information, compared with native listeners. Individual differences among the non-native listeners were related to weaknesses in core neurocognitive abilities affecting behavioral control in everyday life.",2014-10-01,Journal,Article,Journal of the American Academy of Audiology,13601,17,25,Non-native listeners' recognition of high-variability speech using PRESTO,2,,10.3766/jaaa.25.9.9,American Academy of Audiology,1180,International Journal of Child Abuse & Neglect,2014.0,61.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Strategies to reduce rates of infanticide and illegal infant abandonment in Malaysia will require strengthening of the surveillance system and attention to the gender-based inequalities that underpin human development.'}",107629632,S.

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and characteristics of infanticide and illegal infant abandonment in Malaysia and to estimate annual rates for the most recent decade. Summaries of data about infanticide and illegal infant abandonment were gathered from police records; the annual number of live births was ascertained from the national registry. The estimated inferred infanticide rates for Malaysia were compared with the infanticide rates among countries of very high, high, medium, and low rankings on the Human Development, Gender Inequality, and Gini indices.

The estimated inferred infanticide rate fluctuated between 4.82 and 9.11 per 100,000 live births, a moderate rate relative to the infanticide rates of other countries. There are substantial missing data, with details undocumented for about 78-87% of cases and suspected perpetrators. Of the documented cases, it appeared that more boys than girls were victims and that suspected perpetrators were predominantly Malays who were women, usually mothers of the victim; the possibility of arrest bias must be acknowledged.

In addition, although females on average represent 60% of the students in these courses, their voices make up less than 40% of those heard responding to instructor-posed questions to the class, one of the most common ways of engaging students in large lectures. Based on these data, we propose that, despite numerical dominance of females, gender disparities remain an issue in introductory biology classrooms.

Method: Because of data deficiency, the real-time water film depth, the car-following distance, and the vertical curve grade were estimated with available data sources and a GIS analysis to capture rainy weather conditions at the crash location and time. Using a negative binomial regression for crash frequency estimation, the average annual daily traffic per lane, the interaction between the posted speed limit change and the existence of an off-ramp, and the interaction between the travel lane number change and the pavement surface material change were found to increase the likelihood of vehicle to vehicle crashes under rainfall. Results: However, more average daily rainfall per month and a wider left shoulder were identified as factors that decrease the likelihood of vehicle to vehicle crashes. In the crash severity estimation using the multinomial logit model that outperformed the ordered logit model, the travel lane number, the interaction between the travel lane number and the slow grade, the deep water film, and the rear-end collision type were more likely to increase the likelihood of injury crashes under rainfall compared with crashes involving only property damage.

1185,"Introduction: In May 2012, Argentina passed its ""Gender Identity"" Law, which aimed to address the legal invisibility, discrimination and marginalization that transgender individuals have historically faced. The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with engagement with the Gender Identity Law among transwomen living in Argentina. Methods: Data were derived from a 2013 nationwide, cross-sectional study involving transwomen in Argentina. Using multivariate logistic regression, we assessed the prevalence and factors associated with acquiring a gender-congruent identity card within the first 18 months of enactment of the Gender Identity Law. Results: Among 452 transwomen, 260 (57.5%) reported that they had obtained a new gender-congruent identity card. In multivariate analysis, factors positively associated with acquiring a new ID were: previously experiencing discrimination by healthcare workers (adjusted odd ratio [aOR] = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.27-3.20); having engaged in transition procedures (aOR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.58-5.93); and having a job other than sex work (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.06-3.10). Foreign born transwomen were less likely to have obtained a new ID (aOR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06-0.33). Conclusions: More than half of transwomen in our sample acquired a new gender-congruent ID within the first 18 months of enactment of the Gender Identity Law. However, access to and uptake of this right has been heterogeneous. In particular, our findings suggest that the most empowered transwomen may have been among the first to take advantage of this right. Although educational level, housing conditions, HIV status and sex work were not associated with the outcome, foreign-born status was a strong negative correlate of new ID acquisition. Therefore, additional efforts should be made in order to ensure that benefits of this founding policy reach all transwomen in Argentina. © 2014 Socías et al.",2014-08-18,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,9,9,Towards full citizenship: Correlates of engagement with the Gender Identity Law among transwomen in Argentina,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0105402,,1185,PLoS ONE,2014.0,87.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings emphasize the need to integrate gender issues in the ongoing immunization programme in India, with particular attention to urban areas, developed states, and to the Muslim community.'}",2844792,R.

1186,"Background: Recent evidence indicated that gender disparity in child health is minimal and narrowed over time in India. However, considering the geographical and socio-cultural diversity in India, the gender gap may persist across disaggregated socioeconomic context which may be masked by average level. This study examines the dynamics of gender disparity in childhood immunization across regions, residence, wealth, caste and religion in India during 1992-2006. Method: We used multi-waves of the cross-sectional data of National Family Health Survey conducted in India between 1992-93 and 2005-06. Gender disparity ratio was used to measure the gender gap in childhood immunization across the selected socioeconomic characteristics. Multinomial regression analysis was used to examine the gender gap after accounting for other covariates. Result: Results indicate that, at aggregate level, gender disparity in full immunization is minimal and has stagnated during the study period. However, gender disparity - disfavouring female children - becomes apparent across the regions, poor households, and religion - particularly among Muslims. Adjusted gender disparity ratio indicates that, full immunization is lower among female than male children of the western region, poor household and among Muslims. Between 1992-93 and 2005-06, the disparity in full immunization had narrowed in the northern region whereas it had, astonishingly, increased in some of the western and southern states of the country.

Discrimination was documented during the previous two years on the grounds of HIV infection, gender, country of birth, skin colour, sexual orientation, place of residence, and substance abuse in a variety of contexts. For each context, we performed logistic regressions on discrimination, controlling for socio-epidemiological group, age, education level and employment status. Discrimination is frequently experienced by PLHIV in France (26%), particularly when applying for a job (24%), interacting with family (11%) or seeking health services (8%). Women from sub-Saharan Africa reported the highest levels of discrimination, whereas heterosexual non-African men reported the lowest. Men who have sex with men experienced levels of discrimination that fell between those of these two groups. The major perceived reason for discrimination was HIV status (13%). Nationality, skin colour and sexual orientation were cited by 5% each, whereas gender was cited by 1% of respondents. Our analyses show that discrimination is a frequent and cross-cutting experience with differences across the various contexts and among the diverse subpopulations. The intertwining of HIV-related stigma with sexism, racism and homophobia needs to be addressed to understand why discrimination against PLHIV persists when the disease itself has greatly evolved. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.",2014-07-04,Journal,Article,AIDS Care - Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV,21321,38,26,Multiple discriminations experienced by people living with HIV in France: Results from the ANRS-Vespa2 study,0,false,10.1080/09540121.2014.907385,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,1187,International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology,2014.0,0.0,0.0,,6773652,J.

1191,"© The Author(s) 2014.Sexism is often expressed in subtle and ambiguous ways, causing targets to doubt their own capabilities or to show stereotypeconfirming behavior. This research examines whether the self-confidence and stereotype (dis-)confirming behavior of targets of sexism can be bolstered when other male versus female sources suggest that sexism may have played a role. Both Study 1 (N = 78) and Study 2 (N = 90) show that a suggestion of sexism has more beneficial effects when it is made by male sources than when it is made by female sources. When males suggested that sexism had taken place, targets reported more self-confidence (less self-handicapping and higher personal performance state self-esteem) and showed less stereotype confirmation (less self-stereotyping and better task performance) than when sexism was suggested by a female source.

1192,"Male Xenopus laevis frogs have been observed to clasp other males in a sustained, amplectant position, the purpose of which is unknown. We examined three possible hypotheses for this counter-intuitive behavior: 1) clasping males fail to discriminate the sex of the frogs they clasp; 2) male-male clasping is an aggressive or dominant behavior; or 3) that males clasp other males to gain proximity to breeding events and possibly engage in sperm competition. Our data, gathered through a series of behavioral experiments in the laboratory, refute the first two hypotheses. We found that males did not clasp indiscriminately, but showed a sex preference, with most males preferentially clasping a female, but a proportion preferentially clasping another male. Males that clasped another male when there was no female present were less likely to ""win"" reproductive access in a male-male-female triad, indicating that they did not establish dominance through clasping. However, those males did gain proximity to oviposition by continued male-male clasping in the presence of the female. Thus, our findings are consistent with, but cannot confirm, the third hypothesis of male-male clasping as an alternative reproductive tactic. © 2014 Rhodes et al.",2014-05-21,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,6,9,Male-male clasping may be part of an alternative reproductive tactic in Xenopus laevis,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0097761,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,1192,,2014.0,40.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is proposed that the mode of processing is critical for both types of visual memory, and verbalisation influenced implicit memory consistent with the explanation of the processing shift account.'}",4369342,Yaelan Jung,1920282,S.

1193,"Verbally describing a previously seen face can impair subsequent recognition of the described face. Although this phenomenon, known as the verbal overshadowing effect, has been found in the context of recognition memory, Lloyd-Jones, Brown, and Clarke found that it does not reduce the amount of priming (one type of implicit memory) but influences the reaction times (RTs) for a perceptual task. Here, we re-examined the effect of verbalisation on implicit memory by manipulating the processing mode for both description and perceptual tasks. With this experimental design, we found that verbalisation influenced implicit memory consistent with the explanation of the processing shift account. Verbalisation can leave the priming effect intact but lengthens the RTs when the processing mode involved in verbalisation is inappropriate for the perceptual task. Also, we found that the face inversion effect was modulated by the processing mode involved in verbalisation. We suggest, therefore, that implicit memory is not different from explicit memory in the way that it is affected by verbalisation.

1197,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. It is a leading cause of cervical cancer in women but the virus is increasingly being linked to several other cancers in men and women alike. Since the introduction of safe and effective but also expensive vaccines, many developed countries have implemented selective vaccination programs for girls. Some however argue that these programs should be expanded to include boys, since (1) HPV constitutes non-negligible health risks for boys as well and (2) protected boys will indirectly also protect girls. In this paper we approach this discussion from an ethical perspective. First, on which moral grounds can one justify not reimbursing vaccination for the male sex? We develop an ethical framework to evaluate selective vaccination programs and conclude that, in the case of HPV, efficiency needs to be balanced against non-stigmatization, non-discrimination and justice. Second, if vaccination programs were to be expanded to boys as well, do the latter then also have a moral duty to become immunized? Two arguments in favor of such a moral duty are well known in vaccination ethics: the duty not to harm others and to contribute to the public good of public health. However, we argue that these are not particularly convincing in the context of HPV. In contrast, we believe a third, more powerful but also more controversial argument is possible. In our view, the sexual mode of transmission of HPV constitutes an additional reason to believe that boys in fact may have a moral obligation to accept vaccination. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2014-03-01,Journal,Article,HEC Forum,13371,11,26,The sexual ethics of HPV vaccination for boys,2,,10.1007/s10730-013-9219-z,,1197,Brain Imaging and Behavior,2013.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results of this fMRI study raise questions about whether there are meaningful relationships between bipolar dysfunction of specific ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions believed to automatically regulate emotional reactions and the prolonged responses in more lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex.'}",2199030436,Ethan S.

1198,"This fMRI study examined whether hemodynamic responses to affectively-salient stimuli were abnormally prolonged in remitted bipolar disorder, possibly representing a novel illness biomarker. A group of 18 DSM-IV bipolar I-diagnosed adults in remission and a demographically-matched control group performed an event-related fMRI gender-discrimination task in which face stimuli had task-irrelevant neutral, happy or angry expressions designed to elicit incidental emotional processing. Participants' brain activation was modeled using a ""fully informed"" SPM5 basis set. Mixed-model ANOVA tested for diagnostic group differences in BOLD response amplitude and shape within brain regions-of-interest selected from ALE meta-analysis of previous comparable fMRI studies. Bipolar-diagnosed patients had a generally longer duration and/or later-peaking hemodynamic response in amygdala and numerous prefrontal cortex brain regions. Data are consistent with existing models of bipolar limbic hyperactivity, but the prolonged frontolimbic response more precisely details abnormalities recognized in previous studies. Prolonged hemodynamic responses were unrelated to stimulus type, task performance, or degree of residual mood symptoms, suggesting an important novel trait vulnerability brain dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Bipolar patients also failed to engage pregenual cingulate and left orbitofrontal cortex-regions important to models of automatic emotion regulation-while engaging a delayed dorsolateral prefrontal cortex response not seen in controls.

1199,"Perceived sexism has been linked to poorer sexual health among women. However, research has yet to examine whether protective factors, specifically liberal feminist beliefs (i.e., support for women's empowerment and equity), moderate the relation between perceived sexism and precursors to risky sexual behavior. The present studies tested this possibility. In Study 1, 161 female undergraduates reported their liberal feminist beliefs, perceived sexism, and sexual self-efficacy. For women with weaker feminist beliefs, perceived sexism was related to lower sexual self-efficacy. For women with stronger feminist beliefs, perceived sexism was uncorrelated with sexual self-efficacy. In Study 2, 85 women with weaker or stronger liberal feminist beliefs were exposed to either hostile or benevolent sexism and subsequently reported their expectations to initiate condom use during sex. Participants with strong feminist beliefs reported greater anticipated condom use than those with weak feminist beliefs, but only in the hostile sexism condition; in the benevolent sexism condition, women with strong feminist beliefs reported condom use intentions that were similar to those reported by women with weak feminist beliefs. Results suggest women's attitudes and social environment work together to shape sexual well-being and that liberal feminist beliefs may be a powerful tool women can employ to combat hostile, but not benevolent, sexism. © The Author(s) 2013.",2014-03-01,Journal,Article,Psychology of Women Quarterly,14035,13,38,Feminist With Benefits: College Women's Feminist Beliefs Buffer Sexual Well-Being Amid Hostile (Not Benevolent) Sexism,0,false,10.1177/0361684313504736,,1199,,2014.0,94.0,3.0,,51020993,Emily A.

1200,"The current study broadens our understanding of workplace gender harassment (a subdomain of sex-based harassment) by developing an expanded taxonomy and measurement instrument. We move beyond sexual insults to include hostility targeting one's gender, gender role (non)conformity, and motherhood status. In Study 1, we convened a panel of seven subject matter experts to brainstorm behaviors covering the full content domain of gender harassment, which they later grouped into categories in an open card-sorting task. To tap these categories, we combined survey items from the existing literature with a pool of new items. In Study 2, we administered these items to 425 working women. Exploratory principal axis factoring and confirmatory factor analyses revealed an underlying five-factor structure in these data, reflecting both new and extant themes from the literature.

None of the other societies with known suicide data has had female suicide rates higher than those for the males. While we investigate the factors that contribute to the relatively high suicide rates for Chinese women, we also need to ask what makes the relatively low suicide rates for Chinese men. In this study we try to examine some social and cultural variables in rural Chinese youths in order to identify the factors that account for the relatively low rate for men and relatively high rate for women. In rural China, 392 suicides (both men and women) aged 14-35 years consecutively sampled from 16 counties of three provinces were studied with 416 community living controls of the same age range and from the same locations. Case-control psychological autopsy method was used for the data collection. It is found that believing in Confucianism and being married are both protecting the rural young men from suicide, while the two same variables are either risk or non-protecting factors for the Chinese rural young women's suicide. In rural China, social structure and culture may play an even more important role determining a society's suicide rates as well as the gender ratios. Thus, suicide prevention may need to include culture specific measures. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2014-02-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,14,70,The Gender Ratio of Chinese Suicide Rates: An Explanation in Confucianism,0,false,10.1007/s11199-013-0333-9,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",1202,Medical Journal of Australia,2014.0,23.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A change in the gender ratio observed among enrolled medical students after removal of the interview from the selection process is reported.'}",144105992,D.

1203,"Objective: To report, and determine reasons for, a change in the gender ratio observed among enrolled medical students after removal of the interview from the selection process. Design, setting and participants: Cross-sectional study of 4051 students admitted to the medical program at the University of Queensland between 2004 and 2012. Students are enrolled either directly as graduates or via a school-leaver pathway. Main outcome measures: Change in proportions of male and female students over time, and gender-specific scores in the three sections of the GAMSAT (Graduate Medical School Admissions Test). Results: Between 2004 and 2008 (when an interview was part of the selection process), 891 enrolled students (51.4%) were male, whereas between 2009 and 2012 (no interview), 1134 (57.7%; P< 0.001) were male. This change in gender ratio was limited to domestic direct graduate-entry students, and the male proportion in this group rose from 50.9% (705 students) before the interview was removed to 64.0% (514 students; P < 0.001) after removal of the interview (reaching 73.8% in 2012). Between 2004 and 2012, male students consistently performed better than female students on GAMSAT section III (mean score, 71.5 v 68.5; P < 0.001).

1204,"Objective: A screening survey for osteoporotic fractures in men and women in Hong Kong represents the first large-scale prospective population-based study on bone health in elderly (≥65 years) Chinese men and women. This study aims to identify the prevalence and potential risk factors of lumbar spondylolisthesis in these subjects. Methods: The lateral lumbar radiographs of 1,994 male and 1,996 female patients were analysed using the Meyerding classification. Results: Amongst the men, 380 (19.1 %) had at least one spondylolisthesis and 43 (11.3 %) had slips at two or more levels; 283 had anterolisthesis, 85 had retrolisthesis, whereas 12 subjects had both anterolisthesis and retrolisthesis. Amongst the women, 499 (25.0 %) had at least one spondylolisthesis and 69 (13.8 %) had slips at two or more levels; 459 had anterolisthesis, 34 had retrolisthesis, whereas 6 subjects had both anterolisthesis and retrolisthesis. Advanced age, short height, higher body mass index (BMI), higher bone mineral density (BMD) and degenerative arthritis are associated with spondylolisthesis. Lower Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score was associated with spondylolisthesis in men; higher body weight, angina and lower grip strength were associated with spondylolisthesis in women. Conclusion: The male/female ratio of lumbar spondylolisthesis prevalence was 1:1.3 in elderly Chinese. Men are more likely to have retrolisthesis. Key Points: • The prevalence of spondylolisthesis is 19.1 % in elderly Chinese men. • The prevalence of spondylolisthesis is 25.0 % in elderly Chinese women. • Men are more likely to have retrolisthesis. • Anterolisthesis is most commonly seen at the L4/L5 level. • Retrolisthesis is most commonly seen at the L3/L4 level. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.",2014-02-01,Journal,Article,European Radiology,16687,50,24,Prevalence and risk factors of lumbar spondylolisthesis in elderly Chinese men and women,2,,10.1007/s00330-013-3041-5,,1204,,2015.0,59.0,1.0,,121358355,G.

Methods: We assembled a panel of experts appointed by the Secretariat of the National AIDS Plan and GeSIDA that included internal medicine physicians with expertise in the field of HIV infection, gynecologists, pediatricians and psychologists, and two panel members acting as coordinators. Scientific information was reviewed in publications and conference reports up to October 2012. In keeping with the criteria of the Infectious Disease Society of America, two levels of evidence were applied to support the proposed recommendations: the strength of the recommendation according to expert opinion (A, B, C), and the level of empirical evidence (i, ii, iii), already used in previous documents from SPNS/GeSIDA Results: We provide multiple recommendations for the clinical management of women with HIV infection, considering both the diagnostic and possible therapeutic strategies. The consensus recommends gender mainstreaming in health care, and promoting training for healthcare professionals in order to avoid gender bias. With currently available data it seems that the effectiveness of the treatment is the same in both men and women, there being no limitation as to the use of any antiretroviral for this reason. Women have more treatments suspended for reasons other than virological failure, thus they require better monitoring.

Self-perceived health is an indicator that is related to the possibility of chronic disease, the use of health services, and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess inequalities in self-perceived health in relation to age, gender, socioeconomic factors, and functional dependence. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA criteria. An exhaustive search was performed in PubMed, WOK, Science Direct, EMBASE, IME, Cochrane, JSTOR, Ovid, Proquest, the BMJ Group and in Spanish doctoral theses up to April 2013. The quality of the studies was assessed by two independent editors through the Berra Tool. Results: A total of 20 documents were selected. These studies were in agreement in the deterioration of self-perceived health among older people (except the oldest), in those with functional dependence, lower socioeconomic status, and in women. Conclusions: This review shows that, among older people, inequalities in self-perceived health due to socioeconomic status and gender have persisted in time.

As with other forms of prejudice and discrimination, it functions to maintain status and power differences between groups in society. One manifestation of sexism involves prejudice and discrimination against girls and women who seek to achieve in prestigious fields traditionally associated with males. Another manifestation of sexism, however, occurs when pressures are placed on boys and men to conform to traditional conceptions of masculinity. Over the last two decades, an increasing number of developmental and educational psychologists have become concerned about sexism directed toward children and adolescents in school contexts. Our chapter reviews the research on this topic. After providing an overview of different processes related to sexism, we examine how it is manifested in school contexts. Sexism is seen through gender-stereotyped biases against girls and boys in academic and athletic achievement. Also, it occurs through sexual harassment in social interactions.

This qualitative study aimed to establish the perspectives of doctors, from various clinical specialities, on HPAT-Ireland, a new selection tool for undergraduate medical students. Methods: Fifteen doctors participated over three iterative cycles of recruitment, interviewing and analysis. Prior to interview, participants sat a practice HPAT-Ireland test. HPAT-Ireland has three sections: (1) Logical reasoning/problem solving; (2) Interpersonal understanding and (3): Non-verbal reasoning. Summary of results: Three themes emerged: job relatedness; utility of HPAT-Ireland and diversity. Sections 1 and 2 were considered very job related however Section 3 was widely criticised for lacking clinical relevance. Doctors did not think that the test would reliably predict future performance. However, one-third felt it was acceptable as a selection tool in conjunction with academic record. Those who found it unacceptable were influenced by its perceived narrow focus, limited job relatedness, potential for socioeconomic bias, impact on gender and potential for negative influence on student diversity.

Instead of the generally manual methods of analysis employed in many previous studies, corpora and modern software tools are used (frequency counts, collocation, and concordancing analyses via WordSmith tools) in an attempt to investigate whether the Japanese government's attempt to promote a gender-equal society through education in recent years has been put into practice by textbook writers and publishers.

1220,"In a survey study of 458 U.S. women and men, we examined experiences of incivility at an academic conference, a context that represents an important extension of the academic/professional workplace. We hypothesized and found that women reported more incivility, perceived the climate to be more sexist, and reported more conference exclusion than men. Counter to our prediction, men and women did not differ in how negatively they viewed the climate or their conference satisfaction. Since incivility may be a subtle form of bias that targets women more than men, women's experiences of incivility may lead them to view the environment as more sexist. We found support for this, such that the relationship between incivility and sexist climate perceptions were stronger for women than men. Finally, we proposed that incivility would be related to negative conference outcomes through more negative perceptions of the conference climate for both genders, and through sexist climate perceptions only for women. Results of our path analyses indicated that positive, but not sexist, climate perceptions mediated the relationship between incivility and conference satisfaction for both genders. Further, both sexist and positive climate perceptions mediated the relationship between incivility and conference exclusion for both genders. We discuss incivility as a gendered phenomenon related to sexist contexts, as well as reasons for the observed mediated relationships.

1221,"The Afghanistan gender inequality index shows that 70% loss in development is due to the limited participation of women in the workforce, low education and poor women's health outcomes. However, since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2002, gender inequalities in health have improved. This paper will review factors that led to these improvements. The review draws upon information from various sources, including formative and applied research, surveys and existing information systems. The review showed gender differentials in morbidity, mortality and accessing and utilising health services. Health professionals have expressed inadequate medical knowledge and interpersonal skills to address sensitive issues, such as domestic, physical and sexual violence. Discussing sexuality and its impact on health remains taboo both within and outside of the medical profession. Strict cultural norms restrict a woman's autonomy to seek health care, choose a marriage partner and have control over her body, indicating a need to increase awareness about how harmful social practices adversely affect health.

1223,"Studies of X chromosome evolution in various organisms have indicated that sex-biased genes are nonrandomly distributed between the X and autosomes. Here, to extend these studies to nematodes, we annotated and analyzed X chromosome gene content in four Caenorhabditis species and in Pristionchus pacificus. Our gene expression analyses comparing young adult male and female mRNA-seq data indicate that, in general, nematode X chromosomes are enriched for genes with high female-biased expression and depleted of genes with high male-biased expression. Genes with low sex-biased expression do not show the same trend of X chromosome enrichment and depletion. Combined with the observation that highly sex-biased genes are primarily expressed in the gonad, differential distribution of sex-biased genes reflects differences in evolutionary pressures linked to tissue-specific regulation of X chromosome transcription. Our data also indicate that X dosage imbalance between males (XO) and females (XX) is influential in shaping both expression and gene content of the X chromosome. Predicted upregulation of the single male X to match autosomal transcription (Ohno's hypothesis) is supported by our observation that overall transcript levels from the X and autosomes are similar for highly expressed genes. However, comparison of differentially located one-to-one orthologs between C. elegans and P. pacificus indicates lower expression of X-linked orthologs, arguing against X upregulation. These contradicting observations may be reconciled if X upregulation is not a global mechanism but instead acts locally on a subset of tissues and X-linked genes that are dosage sensitive. © 2014 by the Genetics Society of America.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Genetics,22173,65,197,Sex-biased gene expression and evolution of the X chromosome in nematodes,2,,10.1534/genetics.114.163311,Geneticsbabbott@faseb.org,1223,,2014.0,36.0,6.0,,114155794,Isabella Steyer,,,,,,,,,,,19.0,286.0,7.0,15.0,289.0,6.0,3.0,431.0,3.0,21.0,742.0,8.0,237.0,8640.0,47.0,69.0,3333.0,24.0,Psychology
1224,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the significant underrepresentation of females and stereotypical portrayals of both females and males that still exist in different kinds of media children are exposed to, as well as to various negative influences these may have on children's development. In addition, this paper intends to show up the potential positive effects of non-sexist gender representations in these media. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews studies that have been conducted on various kinds of media, in order to gain and provide a representative overview of gender portrayals and of possible influences they might have on children. Findings: Women are underrepresented in children's literature, television programs, as well as computer-related software. Traditional portrayals of females are also still the norm in these media that children are daily faced with. Alarming trends regarding the representations of males have also been found. The negative influence of sexist representations on children has been shown by numerous studies, as has been the potential of positively affecting children's development by exposing them to non-traditional gender representations. Originality/value: Awareness of how highly present sexism still is in media for children and of the ways in which it may inhibit children's development is seen as a crucial step toward change.

1225,"In a set of two studies, we tested whether gender-stereotypical associations are automatically activated by Spanish women in a categorization task, and how this process is conditioned by the context in which the target is presented (kitchen vs. office). We hypothesized that gender stereotypes would be activated implicitly when the target (men vs. women) appeared in an office context (associated with male dominant roles), but not when they appeared in a kitchen context (traditionally associated with female roles). The studies were conducted with two samples (N = 44; N = 47) of female undergraduate students from the University of Granada (Spain). In both studies, a priming effect was found, indicating that a traditional, role-congruent stereotype pattern (men-competence, women-warmth) emerged when primes appeared in an office context, but not in a kitchen context. Further, negative competence traits were evaluated faster when a male prime was presented in the context of a kitchen (role-incongruent). The purpose of Study 2 was to clarify the implicit nature of this contextual contingency effect by manipulating the controllability of the priming effect (i.e., Stimulus Onset Asynchrony duration-SOA, and restricted response time). The results of Study 1 were replicated in only the short SOA condition, which implies faster and presumably less controlled processing of the stimuli.

1226,"By taking advantage of the Italian protest in 2009 in reaction to the behaviour of then Prime Minister Berlusconi, in this research, we investigated the role of sexist beliefs (i.e., hostile sexism, complementary gender differentiation, protective paternalism, and heterosexual intimacy) and group-based emotional reactions (i.e., anger, humiliation, and sadness) to women's and men's action mobilization against public forms of sexism. The findings of this study suggest that women and men engaged in this protest for different reasons. Women mobilized to express their anger at Berlusconi's sexist behaviour, an emotion related to the condemnation of hostile sexist views and benevolent sexist beliefs about heterosexual intimacy. In contrast, the strength of men's participation in the protest was affected by humiliation, an emotion related to the condemnation of hostile sexist beliefs and support for complementary gender differentiation. This emotional path suggests that men likely protested to restore their reputations.

1229,"Purpose To explore relationships between harassment (i.e., race-, weight-, socioeconomic-status (SES)-based, and sexual) and health-related outcomes, including self-esteem, depressive symptoms, body satisfaction, substance use, and self-harm behavior, among diverse adolescents. Method Cross-sectional analysis using data from a population-based study of adolescents participating in Eating and Activity in Teens 2010 (EAT 2010) (n = 2,793; mean age = 14.4 years). Sample was socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse (81% racial/ethnic minority; 54% low or low-middle income). Results Having experienced any type of harassment was significantly associated with poor self-esteem, depressive symptoms, low body satisfaction, substance use, and self-harm behaviors. After mutually adjusting for other types of harassment, weight-based harassment was consistently associated with lower self-esteem and lower body satisfaction in both genders (standardized βs ranged in magnitude from.39 to.48); sexual harassment was significantly associated with self-harm and substance use in both genders (ORs: 1.64 to 2.92); and both weight-based and sexual harassment were significantly associated with depressive symptoms among girls (standardized βs =.34 and.37). Increases in the number of different harassment types reported by adolescents were associated with elevated risk for alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use, and self-harm (ORs: 1.22 to 1.42) as well as emotional well-being (standardized βs:.13 to.26). Conclusions Having had any harassment experience was significantly associated with a variety of negative health and well-being outcomes among adolescents, and risk for these outcomes increases with the number of harassment types an adolescent experiences.

Although recent neuroimaging studies have reported changes in neural activity during facial emotion processing in males with CD or callous-unemotional (CU) traits, there have been no neuroimaging studies specifically assessing females with CD. We addressed this gap by investigating whether female adolescents with CD show atypical neural activation when processing emotional or neutral faces. Method We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 20 female adolescents with CD and 20 female control participants while they viewed angry, sad, and neutral faces. Results An omnibus group (CD, control) by facial emotion (angry, sad, neutral) analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed main effects of facial emotion in superior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and insula, and main effects of group in medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and right anterior insula. Female participants with CD showed reduced medial OFC and increased anterior insula responses relative to healthy controls. There were no significant group × facial emotion interactions.

1233,"Introduction: Compared to men, the decline in smoking during the past few decades has been slower for women, and smoking-related morbidity and mortality has increased substantially. Identifying sex-specific risk factors will inform more targeted intervention/prevention efforts. The purpose of this research is to examine the interactive effect of psychological (trait antagonism) and social (perceived sex discrimination) factors on current cigarette smoking and whether these effects differ by sex. Methods: Participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS; N = 454) and participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; N = 8,155) completed measures of antagonism, perceived sex discrimination, and reported whether they smoked currently. Logistic regressions were used to predict smoking from antagonism, discrimination, and their interaction. Results: Antagonism was associated with an increased risk of smoking. For women, there was an interaction between antagonism and discrimination: among women who perceived sex discrimination, every standard deviation increase in antagonism was associated with a 2.5 increased risk of current smoking in HANDLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.46-4.39) and an almost 1.5 increased risk in HRS (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.18-1.73). This interaction was not significant for men in either sample. Conclusion: In 2 independent samples, perceived sex discrimination amplified the effect of antagonism on cigarette smoking for women but not men. A hostile disposition and a perceived hostile social environment have a synergistic effect on current cigarette smoking for women. © The Author 2014.

Methods: Encounters between physicians (N= 71) and patients (N= 497) in a hospital were videotaped and patients' satisfaction was measured. Patient-centeredness was measured by trained coders. Results: In the outpatient setting, female physicians were somewhat more patient-centered than male physicians; patient satisfaction did not differ. In the inpatient and emergency room settings, female physicians were notably more patient-centered than male physicians; satisfaction paralleled these differences. Nevertheless, there was some, though mixed, evidence that patient-centeredness predicted satisfaction more strongly in male than female physicians, suggesting that patients valued patient-centered behavior more in male than female physicians. Conclusion: Even though satisfaction mirrored the different behavior styles of male and female physicians in the inpatient and emergency room settings, in all settings male physicians got somewhat more credit for being patient-centered than female physicians did.

We aimed to add to the literature by assessing these relationships among adults seeking psychiatric services in India. Methods: Participants were 60 individuals seeking care at a psychiatric clinic in Bangalore, India. The majority of participants were female with a mean age of 36 years (SD= 9.75). Results: Contrary to our prediction, there were no significant differences between men (M= 28.96; SD= 9.85) and women (M= 33.03; SD= 12.08) on depression severity, t(58). = 1.42, p= .16. Yet, women (M= 10.09, SD= 8.23) reported significantly more perceived stigma than men (M= 5.79, SD= 5.86), t(58). = 2.30, p= .02. Conclusion: While men and women seeking psychiatric services at the psychiatric clinic in India report similar levels of depression severity, women reported more perceived mental illness stigma. Having experienced regular forms of discrimination associated with female status in India, it may be the case that women are more attuned to other forms of stigma, such as mental health stigma investigated in the present study. Given the detrimental impact of stigma on treatment adherence and engagement in care, additional research is needed support this work, including research on interventions to reduce stigma and improve engagement in care. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,12300154709,21,9,"Perceived mental health related stigma, gender, and depressive symptom severity in a psychiatric facility in South India",0,false,10.1016/j.ajp.2014.03.005,Elsevier,1235,Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,2014.0,291.0,11.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It appears necessary to assess individual stress reactivity prospectively and separately at each trimester of pregnancy, to discriminate chronic from acute stress, and to take into consideration moderator variables such as past life events, sociocultural factors, predictability, social support and coping strategies.'}",1404686500,R.

1238,"Objective. Studies of the risks of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with Sjögren syndrome (SS) in Asia are scant. We evaluated the effect of SS on the incidences of DVT and PE in a nationwide, population-based cohort in Taiwan. Methods. We identified patients in Taiwan diagnosed with SS between 1998 and 2008 in the Catastrophic Illness Patient Database and the National Health Insurance Research Database. Each patient with SS was matched to 4 control patients based on age, sex, and index year, and all patients were followed up from the index date to December 31, 2010. We calculated the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI of DVT and PE in the SS and comparison cohorts by using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results.We followed 8920 patients with SS and a comparison cohort of 35,680 for about 50,000 and 200,000 person-years, respectively. The mean age of the SS and comparison cohorts was 53.5 and 53.1 years, respectively, and 88.9% of the patients were women. The risks of DVT and PE among the patients with SS were a 1.83-fold and 3.29-fold greater, respectively, than those for the general population after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and frequency of hospitalization. The patients with a secondary SS had a greater risk of PE (adjusted HR: 5.06; 95% CI: 1.22-21.1) than those with a primary SS (adjusted HR: 3.21; 95% CI: 1.96-5.23). Conclusion.

1239,"Research suggests that patient sex, provider sex, and providers' sexist attitudes interact to influence pain care; however, few empirical studies have examined these influences. We investigated sex (patient and provider) differences in pain treatment and the extent to which providers' sexist attitudes were associated with these differences. Ninety-eight health care providers (52% female) completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and made treatment ratings for 16 computer-simulated patients with low back pain. Patient sex was balanced across vignettes. Results indicated that female patients received significantly higher antidepressant (F[1, 96] = 4.51, P <.05, ηp2 =.05) and mental health referral (F[1, 96] = 3.89, P =.05, ηp2 =.04) ratings than male patients, which is consistent with our hypotheses; however, these differences were significant only among female providers. Controlling for providers' sexism scores did not substantially alter these results, which is counter to our hypotheses. These results suggest that female providers are more likely to recommend psychosocial treatments for female than for male pain patients, and providers' sexist attitudes do not account for these differences. Research is needed to elucidate the contributors to sex/gender differences in treatment in order to reduce pain disparities.

1240,"This article examines how media texts that take sexism as their topic can be analysed for the ways in which they present what does (or does not) constitute sexism in the particular event being reported upon. To do so, it treats any such text as a 'recontextualisation'. This concept, drawn from the field of critical discourse analysis, suggests that for an incident of sexism to be reported in any media text is also for that incident to be recontextualised in and through the linguistic, visual and graphological choices of that text's author. To catch this process of recontextualisation in-flight, the article studies video footage of an incident from the world of English Premier League football in which the actions of two television presenters precipitated various complaints of sexism. A discursive analysis of newspaper reports about that incident reveals the textual practices through which the presenters' actions were recontextualised such that their status precisely as 'sexist actions' was readably downgraded, mitigated or even deleted. The article ends with a discussion of how an analysis of the media's practices for recontextualising incidents of sexism contributes to the project of a specifically feminist media studies. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Gender Studies,23704,16,23,"Jokes, pranks, blondes and banter: Recontextualising sexism in the British print press",0,false,10.1080/09589236.2013.774269,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,1240,Psicothema,2014.0,39.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Two concatenated studies based on a relatively well-founded theoretical and empirical approach show that explicit and implicit assessment converge, and there is still no equity in some gender roles in the domestic sphere.'}",50384667,J.

To solve this contradiction, we carried out two concatenated studies based on a relatively well-founded theoretical and empirical approach. Method: The first study was designed to obtain a sample of genderized activities of the domestic sphere by means of an explicit assessment. Forty-two raters (22 women and 20 men, balanced on age, sex, and level of education) took part as raters. In the second study, an implicit assessment of gender roles was carried out, focusing on the response time given to the sample activities obtained from the first study. A total of 164 adults (90 women and 74 men, mean age = 43), with experience in living with a partner and balanced on age, sex, and level of education, participated. Results: Taken together, results show that explicit and implicit assessment converge. The current social reality shows that there is still no equity in some gender roles in the domestic sphere.

1243,"A recent wave of research suggests that teachers overrate the performance of girls relative to boys and hold more positive attitudes toward girls' mathematics abilities. However, these prior estimates of teachers' supposed female bias are potentially misleading because these estimates (and teachers themselves) confound achievement with teachers' perceptions of behavior and effort. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), Study 1 demonstrates that teachers actually rate boys' mathematics proficiency higher than that of girls when conditioning on both teachers' ratings of behavior and approaches to learning as well as past and current test scores. In other words, on average girls are only perceived to be as mathematically competent as similarly achieving boys when the girls are also seen as working harder, behaving better, and being more eager to learn. Study 2 uses mediation analysis with an instrumental-variables approach, as well as a matching strategy, to explore the extent to which this conditional underrating of girls may explain the widening gender gap in mathematics in early elementary school.

Materials and Methods An analysis of the 5% Medicare Public Use Files, from 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010, was performed to assess the use of ureteroscopy (URS), extracorporal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ureterolithotomy (UL) in treating ureteric calculi. Patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases 9th edition (Clinical Modification) and Current Procedure Terminology codes. Statistical analyses using the Fisher and chi-squared tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis (dependent variables: URS, ESWL, UL, treatment, no treatment; independent variables: age, gender, ethnicity, geography and year of treatment) were performed. Results A total of 299 920 patients with ureteric calculi were identified. Of these, 115 200 underwent surgery. Men (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, P < 0.001) were more likely, while patients from ethnic minorities (OR = 0.84, P = 0.004) were less likely to be treated. Patients in the West of the USA were also less likely to be treated (OR = 0.76, P < 0.001) as were patients aged <65 or >84 years old (P = 0.29). The predominant surgical approach was URS (65.2%), followed by ESWL (33.6%) and UL (1.2%). The use of URS increased over time, while the use of ESWL and UL declined. Women (OR = 1.25, P < 0.001) were more likely to undergo URS. Patients in the South of the USA (OR = 1.51, P < 0.001) and patients from ethnic minorities were more likely to undergo ESWL (OR = 1.23, P = 0.03). Conclusions The surgical treatment of ureteric calculi changed significantly between 2001 and 2010. The use of URS expanded at the expense of ESWL and UL.

1248,"Substantial theoretical, empirical, and clinical work examines trauma as it relates to individual victims and perpetrators. As trauma professionals, it is necessary to acknowledge facets of institutions, cultures, and communities that contribute to trauma and subsequent outcomes. Systemic trauma-contextual features of environments and institutions that give rise to trauma, maintain it, and impact posttraumatic responses-provides a framework for considering the full range of traumatic phenomena. The current issue of the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation is composed of articles that incorporate systemic approaches to trauma. This perspective extends conceptualizations of trauma to consider the influence of environments such as schools and universities, churches and other religious institutions, the military, workplace settings, hospitals, jails, and prisons; agencies and systems such as police, foster care, immigration, federal assistance, disaster management, and the media; conflicts involving war, torture, terrorism, and refugees; dynamics of racism, sexism, discrimination, bullying, and homophobia; and issues pertaining to conceptualizations, measurement, methodology, teaching, and intervention. Although it may be challenging to expand psychological and psychiatric paradigms of trauma, a systemic trauma perspective is necessary on both scientific and ethical grounds. Furthermore, a systemic trauma perspective reflects current approaches in the fields of global health, nursing, social work, and human rights.

1249,"Critical consciousness, the awareness of social oppression, is important to investigate as a buffer against HIV disease progression in HIV-infected African American women in the context of experiences with discrimination. Critical consciousness comprises several dimensions, including social group identification, discontent with distribution of social power, rejection of social system legitimacy, and a collective action orientation. The current study investigated self-reported critical consciousness as a moderator of perceived gender and racial discrimination on HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count in 67 African American HIV-infected women. Higher critical consciousness was found to be related to higher likelihood of having CD4+ counts over 350 and lower likelihood of detectable viral load when perceived racial discrimination was high, as revealed by multiple logistic regressions that controlled for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Multiple linear regressions showed that at higher levels of perceived gender and racial discrimination, women endorsing high critical consciousness had a larger positive difference between nadir CD4+ (lowest pre-HAART) and current CD4+ count than women endorsing low critical consciousness. These findings suggest that raising awareness of social oppression to promote joining with others to enact social change may be an important intervention strategy to improve HIV outcomes in African American HIV-infected women who report experiencing high levels of gender and racial discrimination. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,AIDS and Behavior,20153,51,18,"Critical consciousness, racial and gender discrimination, and HIV disease markers in African American women with HIV",2,,10.1007/s10461-013-0621-y,Springer New York LLCjournals@springer-sbm.com,1249,Brain : a journal of neurology,2013.0,66.0,4.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Giordano et al. show that mitochondrial DNA content and mitochondrial mass are both increased in tissues and cells from unaffected mutation carriers relative to affected relatives and control individuals, suggesting upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis may represent a therapeutic target.'}",48930128,C.

1250,"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a maternally inherited blinding disease caused as a result of homoplasmic point mutations in complex I subunit genes of mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by incomplete penetrance, as only some mutation carriers become affected. Thus, the mitochondrial DNA mutation is necessary but not sufficient to cause optic neuropathy. Environmental triggers and genetic modifying factors have been considered to explain its variable penetrance. We measured the mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial mass indicators in blood cells from affected and carrier individuals, screening three large pedigrees and 39 independently collected smaller families with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, as well as muscle biopsies and cells isolated by laser capturing from post-mortem specimens of retina and optic nerves, the latter being the disease targets. We show that unaffected mutation carriers have a significantly higher mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial mass compared with their affected relatives and control individuals. Comparative studies of fibroblasts from affected, carriers and controls, under different paradigms of metabolic demand, show that carriers display the highest capacity for activating mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore we postulate that the increased mitochondrial biogenesis in carriers may overcome some of the pathogenic effect of mitochondrial DNA mutations. Screening of a few selected genetic variants in candidate genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis failed to reveal any significant association. Our study provides a valuable mechanism to explain variability of penetrance in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and clues for high throughput genetic screening to identify the nuclear modifying gene(s), opening an avenue to develop predictive genetic tests on disease risk and therapeutic strategies. © 2013 The Author (2013).",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Brain,14317,203,137,Efficient mitochondrial biogenesis drives incomplete penetrance in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy,1,true,10.1093/brain/awt343,Oxford University Pressjnl.info@oup.co.uk,1250,Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience,2014.0,85.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is concluded that the own-gender bias is mainly related to study phase processes, which is in line with sociocognitive accounts.'}",1946743,N.

1251,"It is well established that memory is more accurate for own-relative to other-race faces (own-race bias), which has been suggested to result from larger perceptual expertise for own-race faces. Previous studies also demonstrated better memory for own-relative to other-gender faces, which is less likely to result from differences in perceptual expertise, and rather may be related to social in-group vs out-group categorization. We examined neural correlates of the own-gender bias using event-related potentials (ERP). In a recognition memory experiment, both female and male participants remembered faces of their respective own gender more accurately compared with other-gender faces. ERPs during learning yielded significant differences between the subsequent memory effects (subsequently remembered - subsequently forgotten) for own-gender compared with other-gender faces in the occipito-temporal P2 and the central N200, whereas neither later subsequent memory effects nor ERP old/new effects at test reflected a neural correlate of the own-gender bias.

1252,"Gender inequalities in health have been widely described, but few studies have examined the upstream sources of these inequalities in health the objectives of this review are 1) to identify empirical papers that assessed the effect of gender equality policies on gender inequalities in health or on women's health by using between-country (or administrative units within a country) comparisons and 2) to provide an example of published evidence on the effects of a specific policy (parental leave) on women's health. We conducted a literature search covering the period from 1970 to 2012, using several bibliographical databases. We assessed 1,238 abstracts and selected 19 papers that considered gender equality policies, compared several countries or different states in 1 country, and analyzed at least 1 health outcome among women or compared between genders. To illustrate specific policy effects, we also selected articles that assessed associations between parental leave and women's health. Our review partially supports the hypothesis that Nordic social democratic welfare regimes and dual-earner family models best promote women's health. Meanwhile, enforcement of reproductive policies, mainly studied across US states, is associated with better mental health outcomes, although less with other outcomes. Longer paid maternity leave was also generally associated with better mental health and longer duration of breastfeeding. © 2013 The Author.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Epidemiologic Reviews,13140,98,36,Influence of macrosocial policies on women's health and gender inequalities in health,0,false,10.1093/epirev/mxt002,Oxford University Press,1252,Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics,2013.0,30.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Underlying Tamburini and Tännsjö’s “proposal of equalization” is the assumption that being a man (at least in sports) is overall better than being a woman.'}",47396817,S.

1254,"The repetition of a given stimulus leads to the attenuation of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal compared with unrepeated stimuli, a phenomenon called fMRI adaptation or repetition suppression (RS). Previous studies have related RS of the fMRI signal behaviorally both to improved performance for the repeated stimulus (priming) and to shifts of perception away from the first stimulus (adaptation-related aftereffects). Here we used identical task (sex discrimination), trial structure [stimulus 1 (S1): 3,000 ms, interstimulus interval: 600 ms, stimulus 2 (S2): 300 ms], and S2 stimuli (androgynous faces) to test how RS of the face-specific areas of the occipito-temporal cortex relates to priming and aftereffects. By varying S1, we could induce priming (significantly faster reaction times when S1 and S2 were identical compared with different images) as well as sex-specific aftereffect [an increased ratio of male responses if S1 was a female face compared with ambiguous faces or to Fourier-randomized noise (FOU) images]. Presenting any face as S1 led to significant RS of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the fusiform and occipital face areas as well as in the lateral occipital cortex of both hemispheres compared with FOU, reflecting stimulus category-specific encoding. Additionally, while sex-specific adaptation effects were only observed in occipital face areas, primed trials led to a signal reduction in both face-selective regions. Altogether, these results suggest the differential neural mechanisms of adaptation and repetition priming. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.",2013-12-15,Journal,Article,Journal of Neurophysiology,23475,15,110,Dissociating the neural bases of repetition-priming and adaptation in the human brain for faces,0,false,10.1152/jn.00277.2013,,1254,Journal of Vision,2013.0,86.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results suggest that there are shared neural mechanisms during perceptual encoding, and at least partially separate Neural mechanisms during recognition and decision making for dynamic and invariant facial-feature processing.'}",46317822,Pamela M.

1255,"Bruce and Young (1986) proposed a model for face processing that begins with structural encoding, followed by a split into two processing streams: one for the dynamic aspects of the face (e.g., facial expressions of emotion) and the other for the invariant aspects of the face (e.g., gender, identity). Yet how this is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we took a psychophysical approach using contrast negation to test the Bruce and Young model. Previous research suggests that contrast negation impairs processing of invariant features (e.g., gender) but not dynamic features (e.g., expression). In our first experiment, participants discriminated differences in gender and facial expressions of emotion in upright, inverted, and contrast-negated faces. Results revealed a profound impairment for contrast-negated gender discrimination, whereas expression discrimination remained relatively robust to contrast negation. To test whether this differential effect occurs during perceptual encoding, we conducted three additional experiments in which we measured aftereffects following upright, inverted, or contrast-negated face adaptation for the same discrimination task as in the first experiment. Results showed a mild impairment with contrast negation during perceptual encoding for both gender and expression, followed by a marked gender-specific deficit during contrast-negated face discrimination. Taken together, our results suggest that there are shared neural mechanisms during perceptual encoding, and at least partially separate neural mechanisms during recognition and decision making for dynamic and invariant facial-feature processing. © 2014 ARVO.",2013-12-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Vision,14509,12,13,Contrast negation differentiates visual pathways underlying dynamic and invariant facial processing,1,true,10.1167/13.14.13,,1255,Psychological Reports,2013.0,9.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The crisis confronting the protagonist significantly affected judgments of the likelihood of completed suicide, but neither the race nor the sex of the protagonist affected this judgment, suggesting that sex and racial stereotypes about who completes suicide may no longer exist.'}",2081330564,C.

1257,"The aftermath of Caster Semenyas resounding victory in the womens 800 m at the 2009 Athletics World Championships in Berlin highlighted the ethical and scientific flaws of gender verification in womens athletics. It has led the governing international body of professional athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), to adopt new rules regarding athletes with differences of sexual developments (DSDs) in womens competitions in 2011 (Regulations on Hyperandrogenism). The International Olympic Committee followed suit and adopted a similar set of rules in 2012. Locating the practice of gender verification in a history of sexist stereotyping of women athletes (in Section 1), I argue (in Section 2), following other critics, that the IAAFs new rules suffer from the same ethical flaws as their predecessors; and specifically that they still invite and rely on qualitative measuring of an athletes femininity and masculinity. In the central section of this paper (Section 3), I relate the practice of gender verification to the vexing question of what constitutes an unfair advantage in sports. I suggest, first, that athletes with a DSD should be at liberty to exploit competitive advantages their conditions might confer on them, just as most athletes in most sports are at liberty to exploit their congenital traits (the only irrelevant difference being that DSDs are construed as gendered advantages). In a second step, I argue that gender segregation in sports and gender verification practices cannot both be defended by an appeal to fairness. If we want to preserve gender segregation, then we ought to give up gender verification; and if we are not prepared to give up regulation of gendered congenital advantages, then we ought to give up gender segregation in favor of a classification system that tracks genetic predisposition rather than gender. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.",2013-12-01,Journal,Article,"Sport, Ethics and Philosophy",12100156093,8,7,"In the Halfway house of Ill Repute: Gender verification under a different name, still no contribution to fair play",0,false,10.1080/17511321.2013.856460,,1257,The Spanish Journal of Psychology,2013.0,70.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Examination of the type of leadership role depending on gender in a sample of 158 Spanish adolescents according to three types of leaders showed that task-oriented traits were more characteristic of the leadership role than relationship- oriented traits.'}",1402837608,Cristina García-Ael,152714615,Isabel Cuadrado,38900010,F.

1259,"Scientific study of genetic contributions to chronic antisocial behavior has stemmed from many lines of research in recent years. Genetic research involving twin, family, and adoption studies has traditionally been used to compare the health and behavior outcomes of individuals who share the same environment or hereditary lineage; several of these studies have concluded that heredity plays some role in the formation of chronic antisocial behavior, including various forms of aggression and chronic norm-defiance. However, the ethical, social, and legal environment surrounding research on the biological contributions to antisocial behavior in the United States is contentious. Although there has been some discussion in the last few decades regarding the ethical, social, and legal concerns around this type of research within academic and policy circles, analysis and discussion of these concerns rarely appear together.

Using three national samples, we found that PD based on race, sex, age, family obligation, and sexual orientation related to physical withdrawal (i.e., lateness, absenteeism, and intent to quit) indirectly through psychological withdrawal (i.e., burnout and engagement) such that PD corresponded in less engagement and more burnout, which related to increased lateness, absenteeism, and intent to quit. Further, these indirect relationships were moderated by employees' coping mechanisms with those who were more apt to change the situation or to avoid the stressor exhibiting weaker relationships between PD and psychological withdrawal.

1264,"Two million women and one million men experience rape, stalking, or physical assault by a current or former romantic partner each year in the U.S. Not only do women report twice the incidents, but intimate partner violence (IPV) that women experience is typically more severe. Explanations for IPV gender asymmetry include male dominance attitudes, hostile sexism, and men's control-seeking. There are gaps in our knowledge of how attitudes and control-seeking co-relate to influence IPV. This study demonstrates a mediation analysis to investigate these relationships. Data were from a cross-sectional online survey of male undergraduate students from a public Southeastern university. The survey measured attitudes of male dominance and hostile sexism, desire for control, and IPV perpetration. After including age and academic level in the model, male dominance remained a significant predictor of likelihood of physical IPV (OR = 1.16, p = .004) but not psychological IPV. The addition of control-seeking (physical OR = 1.65, p < .001) mediated the influence of male dominance on the likelihood of physical IPV perpetration (OR = 1.018, p = .753). Hostile sexism was a significant predictor of psychological and physical IPV (psychological IPV OR = 1.31, p < .001; physical IPV OR = 1.54, p < .001), over and above age and academic level. The addition of control-seeking (psychological IPV OR = 1.27, p < .001; physical OR = 1.53, p < .001) partially mediated the influence of hostile sexism on IPV (psychological IPV OR = 1.21, p = .001; physical OR = 1.34, p < .001).

1265,"Aims: We aimed to compare gender differences with respect to presentation of consecutive ambulatory patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), management of their disease, and outcomes. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of an observational (non-interventional) study performed by 616 office-and hospital-based cardiologists in Germany. Consecutive (mainly ambulatory) patients with Electrocardiography (ECG)-confirmed AF and available data from baseline (BL) and two follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months were assessed. Results: A total of 2,742 patients (62.8 % males, mean age 67.5 years; 37.2 % women, mean age 71.2 years) were analysed. Women had more frequently paroxysmal and less frequently permanent AF. Quality of life scores were slightly worse in women compared to men, for all types of AF. For class III anti-arrhythmic drugs at baseline (more frequent in men), and for digitalis (less frequent in men at BL and 1 year) statistically significant differences were noted. Oral anti-coagulation (OAC) without anti-platelet drugs was given in 67.9 % at BL and in 62.7 % at 1 year (no differences between genders). During follow-up, drug conversions in men/women were reported in 12.3 %/14.9 % (p = 0.054), and electrical conversions in 14.6 %/11.7 % (p = 0.03). Hospitalisations occurred in 25.9 % and strokes in 3.5 %. Patients with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores had increased stroke rates (0, 1 and ≥ 2 points: 0.0, 1.5 and 3.9 %, respectively; with no significant gender differences). Conclusion: In everyday management of patients with AF, there were no differences in treatment and major outcomes, in particular stroke, between women and men.

1266,"OBJECTIVES: Transgender individuals, or those who cross or transcend sex categories, commonly experience stigma and discrimination. Anecdotal evidence indicates that this transphobia manifests in health care settings, but few studies address the forms of mistreatment experienced in this context. This study was designed to explore transgender patients' experiences with health care. This brief report focuses on their negative experiences. METHODS: A total of 152 transgender adults were recruited to complete an online questionnaire about their health care. Participants were asked if and how they had been mistreated, and responses were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants' descriptions of mistreatment coalesced around 6 themes: gender insensitivity, displays of discomfort, denied services, substandard care, verbal abuse, and forced care. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insight into transgender patients' perceptions of and sensitivity to mistreatment in health care contexts. This information might be used to increase providers' cultural competency and inform their interactions with transgender patients.

1268,"Women often face sexism and stereotypes about their academic ability, and this makes it important to examine the effects of confronting sexism in the college classroom. The current research consisted of 2 studies of how witnessing a confrontation of a sexist stereotype in the classroom affects female students' perceptions of the confronters and self-reported sexism. The samples consisted of female students from a public college in the Northeastern U.S. who provided their perceptions of teachers described in vignettes as either confronting or not confronting a student's stereotype of women as unskilled at math. In Study 1 (N = 48) perceptions of the teacher were more positive when confronting the stereotype, and students' self-reported sexism was reduced when the teacher confronted rather than ignored the stereotype. Study 2 (N = 56) compared the effects of a teacher versus a student confrontation of the same stereotype. Participants perceived the teacher and student more positively when they confronted rather than ignored the stereotype. However, the source of the confrontation yielded no differences in sexism.

1269,"Can female science professors benefit women? Women's negative implicit cognitions about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines impact performance in these fields, marking implicit associations as a space for potential change to improve women's participation in STEM. Examining college student science majors (N = 320, 63% women) enrolled in chemistry and engineering courses, our study investigates how meaningful contact with female role models impacts women's implicit cognitions about STEM. We used the Implicit Association Test to measure attitudes toward science, identification with science, and gendered stereotypes about science, and we compared students with female versus male professors. Our study first demonstrates both direct and indirect paths between implicit cognitions and women's career aspirations in STEM. Next, when female professors were seen as positive role models, women automatically identified with science and stereotyped science as more feminine than masculine. Moreover, viewing professors as positive role models was associated with pro-science career aspirations and attitudes (both implicit and explicit), for men and women alike. The findings suggest that female science professors benefit women provided students identify with them as role models. We conclude that female STEM professors not only provide positive role models for women, but they also help to reduce the implicit stereotype that science is masculine in the culture-at-large. We further discuss how shifting implicit gendered stereotypes about science can impact women's investment in a science career. © The Author(s) 2013.",2013-09-01,Journal,Article,Psychology of Women Quarterly,14035,113,37,The Influence of Female Role Models on Women's Implicit Science Cognitions,0,false,10.1177/0361684313482109,,1269,Journal of Neuroscience,2013.0,39.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results indicate that firing rate code on the temporal order of seconds is sufficient for accurate classification of pheromonal patterns at different concentrations and may be used by AOS neural circuitry to discriminate among naturally occurring urine stimuli.'}",5347269,I.

1271,"Background: Bias of clinical examiners against some types of candidate, based on characteristics such as sex or ethnicity, would represent a threat to the validity of an examination, since sex or ethnicity are 'construct- irrelevant' characteristics. In this paper we report a novel method for assessing sex and ethnic bias in over 2000 examiners who had taken part in the PACES and nPACES (new PACES) examinations of the MRCP(UK). Method. PACES and nPACES are clinical skills examinations that have two examiners at each station who mark candidates independently. Differences between examiners cannot be due to differences in performance of a candidate because that is the same for the two examiners, and hence may result from bias or unreliability on the part of the examiners. By comparing each examiner against a 'basket' of all of their co-examiners, it is possible to identify examiners whose behaviour is anomalous. The method assessed hawkishness-doveishness, sex bias, ethnic bias and, as a control condition to assess the statistical method, 'even-number bias' (i.e. treating candidates with odd and even exam numbers differently). Significance levels were Bonferroni corrected because of the large number of examiners being considered. Results: The results of 26 diets of PACES and six diets of nPACES were examined statistically to assess the extent of hawkishness, as well as sex bias and ethnicity bias in individual examiners. The control (odd-number) condition suggested that about 5% of examiners were significant at an (uncorrected) 5% level, and that the method therefore worked as expected. As in a previous study (BMC Medical Education, 2006, 6:42), some examiners were hawkish or doveish relative to their peers. No examiners showed significant sex bias, and only a single examiner showed evidence consistent with ethnic bias. A re-analysis of the data considering only one examiner per station, as would be the case for many clinical examinations, showed that analysis with a single examiner runs a serious risk of false positive identifications probably due to differences in case-mix and content-specificity. Conclusions: In examinations where there are two independent examiners at a station, our method can assess the extent of bias against candidates with particular characteristics. The method would be far less sensitive in examinations with only a single examiner per station as examiner variance would be confounded with candidate performance variance. The method however works well when there is more than one examiner at a station and in the case of the current MRCP(UK) clinical examination, nPACES, found possible sex bias in no examiners and possible ethnic bias in only one. © 2013 McManus et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2013-08-07,Journal,Article,BMC Medical Education,28099,31,13,Investigating possible ethnicity and sex bias in clinical examiners: An analysis of data from the MRCP(UK) PACES and nPACES examinations,1,true,10.1186/1472-6920-13-103,,1271,Violence against Women,2013.0,46.0,4.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It was found women with traditional gender role attitudes were least likely to agree that the perpetrator was guilty of rape, and participants were less convinced of the perpetrator’s guilt when the victim resisted verbally than when she resisted verbally and physically.'}",12630129,K.

1277,"Background: Previous studies investigating speech recognition in adverse listening conditions have found extensive variability among individual listeners. However, little is currently known about the core underlying factors that influence speech recognition abilities. Purpose: To investigate sensory, perceptual, and neurocognitive differences between good and poor listeners on the Perceptually Robust English Sentence Test Open-set (PRESTO), a new high-variability sentence recognition test under adverse listening conditions. Research Design: Participants who fell in the upper quartile (HiPRESTO listeners) or lower quartile (LoPRESTO listeners) on key word recognition on sentences from PRESTO in multitalker babble completed a battery of behavioral tasks and self-report questionnaires designed to investigate real-world hearing difficulties, indexical processing skills, and neurocognitive abilities. Study Sample: Young, normal-hearing adults (N 5 40) from the Indiana University community participated in the current study. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants' assessment of their own real-world hearing difficulties was measured with a self-report questionnaire on situational hearing and hearing health history. Indexical processing skills were assessed using a talker discrimination task, a gender discrimination task, and a forced-choice regional dialect categorization task. Neurocognitive abilities were measured with the Auditory Digit Span Forward (verbal short-term memory) and Digit Span Backward (verbal working memory) tests, the Stroop Color and Word Test (attention/inhibition), the WordFam word familiarity test (vocabulary size), the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) self-report questionnaire on executive function, and two performance subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Performance Intelligence Quotient (IQ; nonverbal intelligence). Scores on self-report questionnaires and behavioral tasks were tallied and analyzed by listener group (HiPRESTO and LoPRESTO). Results: The extreme groups did not differ overall on self-reported hearing difficulties in real-world listening environments. However, an item-by-item analysis of questions revealed that LoPRESTO listeners reported significantly greater difficulty understanding speakers in a public place. HiPRESTO listeners were significantly more accurate than LoPRESTO listeners at gender discrimination and regional dialect categorization, but they did not differ on talker discrimination accuracy or response time, or gender discrimination response time. HiPRESTO listeners also had longer forward and backward digit spans, higher word familiarity ratings on the WordFam test, and lower (better) scores for three individual items on the BRIEF-A questionnaire related to cognitive load.

Results indicated that for women, the relationship between gender discrimination (e.g., unequal access to resources) and job satisfaction was mediated by scholarly alienation and a negative workplace climate; gender derogation (e.g., disparaging comments) was related to organizational sexism toward women (OSTW), which was associated with perceptions of scholarly alienation and a negative workplace climate; these perceptions in turn predicted lower job satisfaction. For men, gender derogation was indirectly related to job satisfaction via scholarly alienation, and OSTW was indirectly related to job satisfaction via both climate variables. Analyses indicated that most of these indirect effects were stronger for women than men. We discuss these results for both sexes and suggest reasons why men's climate perceptions may be ""chilled"" by exposure to sexism toward women. We also discuss implications for individuals working with women in male-dominated environments, such as organizational administrators and clinical practitioners. © The Author(s) 2012.",2013-06-01,Journal,Article,Psychology of Women Quarterly,14035,56,37,"Derogation, Discrimination, and (Dis)Satisfaction With Jobs in Science: A Gendered Analysis",0,false,10.1177/0361684312468727,,1280,,2013.0,98.0,2.0,,7899683,Kathryn J.

1281,"The current study examined how feminism relates to women's experiences of sexual harassment-that is, unwanted sexual and sexist conduct in the workplace. We posited that feminism would have both costs (e.g., increasing exposure to harassment) and benefits (e.g., decreasing harassment-related outcomes). We assessed two indicators of feminism: self-identification as ""feminist"" and engagement in feminist activism. We also measured two subtypes of sexual harassment: sexual-advance and gender harassment. According to survey data from 424 working women, feminist identification predicted fewer gender harassment experiences; once harassed, however, feminist-identified women reported the greatest decrease in job satisfaction and increase in turnover intentions. In contrast, feminist activism related to greater experiences of both kinds of harassment, and activism attenuated some negative outcomes. We further found that (regardless of feminist identification or activism) women who had faced sexual-advance harassment were over 7 times more likely to attach the ""sexual harassment"" label to their experiences, compared to women who had experienced gender harassment alone. In light of our findings, we recommend that sexual harassment laws, policies, and trainings be broadened to encompass all varieties of sexual harassment, including non-stereotypical, non-sexual conduct. Organizations would also benefit from interventions that reduce bias against undervalued persons, including feminists. © The Author(s) 2013.",2013-06-01,Journal,Article,Psychology of Women Quarterly,14035,37,37,When Sexism and Feminism Collide: The Sexual Harassment of Feminist Working Women,0,false,10.1177/0361684313482873,,1281,,2013.0,34.0,0.0,,117280179,M.

1282,"In the context of motivated social cognition, the need for cognitive closure emerges like a decisive factor for a better understanding of individual differences on psychosocial variables linked to culture. Besides, they are likely to be taken into account in intervention programmes which objectives would aim to modify attitudes anchored in prejudice and discrimination. The goal of this research is to study this motivational construct and its relationship with sexism and religiosity with a sample of Christians and Muslims teenagers, all of them living in a multicultural context. According to the gathered data, there are not any significant differences between Muslims and Christians in need for cognitive closure and sexism. However, there are significant differences between girls and boys in hostile sexism. The need for cognitive closure was positively related, in a statistically significant way, with sexism (hostile and benevolent), and it is a significant predictor. Muslims got higher scores than Christians on indicators of religiosity in a statistically significant way.

1284,"Objective: Whether weight bias occurs in the graduate school admissions process is explored here. Specifically, we examined whether body mass index (BMI) was related to letter of recommendation quality and the number of admissions offers applicants received after attending in-person interviews. Design and Methods: Participants were 97 applicants to a psychology graduate program at a large university in the United States. They reported height, weight, and information about their applications to psychology graduate programs. Participants' letters of recommendation were coded for positive and negative statements as well as overall quality. Results: Higher BMI significantly predicted fewer post-interview offers of admission into psychology graduate programs. Results also suggest this relationship is stronger for female applicants. BMI was not related to overall quality or the number of stereotypically weight-related adjectives in letters of recommendation. Surprisingly, higher BMI was related to more positive adjectives in letters. Conclusions: The first evidence that individuals interviewing applicants to graduate programs may systematically favor thinner applicants is provided here. A conscious or unconscious bias against applicants with extra body weight is a plausible explanation. Stereotype threat and social identity threat are also discussed as explanations for the relationship between BMI and interview success.

Despite the rise in female candidates running for office, women are not significantly increasing their presence in the House and Senate.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional survey conducted at National Guard Hospitals in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa'a from 27 July to 20 August 2010. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The survey included questions on the prevalence of harassment of different types, inlcuding verbal, academic, physical and sexual harassment, as well as discrimination on the basis of gender, region of origin or physical appearance. RESULTS: Of 380 residents, 213 (56%) returned a completed questionnaire (123 male, 57.8%). At least one of type of harassment and discrimination was reported by 83.6% of respondents. The most frequently reported forms were verbal harassment and gender discrimination (61.5% and 58.3%, respectively). Sexual harassment was commonly reported (19.3%) and was experienced significantly more often by female residents than by male residents (P=.0061).

1291,"Objective: The increased risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS) in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has been documented. No study examined MetS in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), despite the fact that a great proportion of them are treated with antipsychotic addition. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence and the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of MetS in an Italian sample of patients with OCD. Method: Subjects with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, OCD and a Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale score ≥ 16 were included. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, current and lifetime pharmacological treatments, lifestyle information, and comorbidity for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were collected. MetS was diagnosed according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III modified criteria. Results: We enrolled 104 patients with OCD. MetS was present in 21.2% (95% confidence interval: 13.7%-30.3%) of the sample. Abdominal obesity was present in 36.5%, hypertension in 42.3%, high triglycerides in 23.1%, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in 22.1% and fasting hyperglycemia in 4.8% of the sample. MetS was associated with cigarette smoking (duration of cigarette smoking), absence of physical activity, a higher body mass index and a greater proportion of obesity. Among pharmacological treatments, MetS was associated with the duration of the exposure (lifetime) to antipsychotics. Conclusions: This is the first study that examined the prevalence and correlates of MetS in a sample of patients with OCD. Our cross-sectional evaluation found a prevalence of MetS higher than those reported in the Italian general population, although the confidence interval encompasses the general population estimate reported.

1299,"BACKGROUND: Energized and productive faculty are critical to academic medicine, yet studies indicate a lack of advancement and senior roles for women. OBJECTIVE: Using measures of key aspects of the culture of academic medicine, this study sought to identify similarity and dissimilarity between perceptions of the culture by male and female faculty. DESIGN: The C - Change Faculty Survey was used to collect data on perceptions of organizational culture. PARTICIPANTS: A stratified random sample of 4,578 full-time faculty at 26 nationally representative US medical colleges (response rate 52 %). 1,271 (53 %) of respondents were female. MAIN MEASURES: Factor analysis assisted in the creation of scales assessing dimensions of the culture, which served as the key outcomes. Regression analysis identified gender differences while controlling for other demographic characteristics. KEY RESULTS: Compared with men, female faculty reported a lower sense of belonging and relationships within the workplace (T = -3.30, p < 0.01). Self-efficacy for career advancement was lower in women (T = -4.73, p < 0.001). Women perceived lower gender equity (T = -19.82, p < 0.001), and were less likely to believe their institutions were making changes to address diversity goals (T = -9.70, p < 0.001). Women were less likely than men to perceive their institution as family-friendly (T = -4.06, p < 0.001), and women reported less congruence between their own values and those of their institutions (T = -2.06, p < 0.05). Women and men did not differ significantly on levels of engagement, leadership aspirations, feelings of ethical/moral distress, perception of institutional commitment to faculty advancement, or perception of institutional change efforts to improve support for faculty. CONCLUSIONS: Faculty men and women are equally engaged in their work and share similar leadership aspirations. However, medical schools have failed to create and sustain an environment where women feel fully accepted and supported to succeed; how can we ensure that medical schools are fully using the talent pool of a third of its faculty? © 2012 Society of General Internal Medicine.",2013-02-01,Journal,Article,Journal of General Internal Medicine,26643,184,28,"Experiencing the culture of academic medicine: Gender matters, a national study",2,,10.1007/s11606-012-2207-1,,1299,PLoS ONE,2013.0,53.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results from this study support the convergence hypothesis as gender equality at the workplace does not only relate to better mental health for women, but also more similar occurrence of mental ill-health between women and men.'}",6520867,Sofia Elwér,4774442,Lisa Harryson,36432750,Malin Bolin,144675964,A.

1300,"Research in the field of occupational health often uses a risk factor approach which has been criticized by feminist researchers for not considering the combination of many different variables that are at play simultaneously. To overcome this shortcoming this study aims to identify patterns of gender equality at workplaces and to investigate how these patterns are associated with psychological distress. Questionnaire data from the Northern Swedish Cohort (n = 715) have been analysed and supplemented with register data about the participants' workplaces. The register data were used to create gender equality indicators of women/men ratios of number of employees, educational level, salary and parental leave. Cluster analysis was used to identify patterns of gender equality at the workplaces. Differences in psychological distress between the clusters were analysed by chi-square test and logistic regression analyses, adjusting for individual socio-demographics and previous psychological distress. The cluster analysis resulted in six distinctive clusters with different patterns of gender equality at the workplaces that were associated to psychological distress for women but not for men. For women the highest odds of psychological distress was found on traditionally gender unequal workplaces. The lowest overall occurrence of psychological distress as well as same occurrence for women and men was found on the most gender equal workplaces. The results from this study support the convergence hypothesis as gender equality at the workplace does not only relate to better mental health for women, but also more similar occurrence of mental ill-health between women and men. This study highlights the importance of utilizing a multidimensional view of gender equality to understand its association to health outcomes. Health policies need to consider gender equality at the workplace level as a social determinant of health that is of importance for reducing differences in health outcomes for women and men. © 2013 Elwér et al.",2013-01-09,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,25,8,Patterns of Gender Equality at Workplaces and Psychological Distress,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0053246,,1300,Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology (JSEP),2013.0,51.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Investigating the influence of player gender on referees' decision making revealed that biases against women were powerful regardless of the referees' level of expertise and that male referees' stereotype toward female players tends to be negative.""}",6949919,N.

I have also argued that what we know from theory and research on targets' experiences of stigma and discrimination can inform how we pursue the understanding of targets' experiences of dehumanization. To this end, I have emphasized the utility of attention to the intersectionality of minority statuses in shaping discrimination experiences. I have also described theoretical frameworks grounded in different populations' experiences - including theories of discrimination as stressful life events or daily hassles, minority stress frameworks, and objectification theory - and offered examples of integrating these frameworks as a way to attend to intersectionality. As well, I have noted parallels between the areas of convergence across discrimination theories and emerging findings regarding the consequences of dehumanization for targets. Finally, I have described the broad outlines of a pantheoretical framework that reflects areas of convergence and complementary integration across the discrimination and dehumanization literatures. My hope is that this framework will encourage further attention to the potential distinctions between internalization and cognizance of discrimination, exploration of their potentially distinctive intermediary consequences, and consideration of a broader range of outcomes beyond individual health and well-being indicators, and including individual and collective social activism. I also hope that readers will contribute to the critical evaluation and refinement of this pantheoretical framework with continued attention to the intersectionality that characterizes people's identities and experiences of discrimination. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2013-01-01,Book Series,Conference Paper,Nebraska Symposium on Motivation,12733,52,60,"Discrimination, objectification, and dehumanization: Toward a pantheoretical framework",0,false,10.1007/978-1-4614-6959-9_7,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",1304,,2013.0,106.0,0.0,,25174352,E.

1305,"Despite greater awareness that the American population and workforce are increasingly diverse, there is little appreciation for the persistent and discrepant effect of difference on the lived experiences of social outsider groups. Consistent with a history of preference for able-bodied, well off, White, mature, heterosexual, males, for example, most U.S. institutions continue to be hegemonic. Proffering a road map for managing diversity and equalizing life chances across multiple spaces, this paper articulates an innovative conceptual framework called ACRASH. This powerful analogy and acronym (for ableism, classism, racism, ageism, sexism, and heterosexism) denotes the primary dimensions of difference that spawn discrimination, harassment, and prejudice and shape disparate realities for Americans. As well, attention calling, perpetual proportionate affirmative action, and the use of a progressive syntax are posited as effective means for improved relations and the development of more positive socioeconomic and political outcomes in the U.S. and, perhaps, beyond.

1306,"Although women of color have been hypothesized to experience double jeopardy in the form of chronic exposure to both race-based (RBD) and gender-based discrimination (GBD; Beal, 1970), few empirical investigations that examine both RBD and GBD in multiple comparison groups have been conducted. In addition to being one of the only simultaneous examinations of RBD and GBD in multiple comparison groups, the current study includes both self-report and objective behavioral data to examine the independent and interactive effects of both forms of discrimination. This study is also the first of its kind to examine these constructs in these ways and to explore their impact in a unique sample of ethnically diverse male and female Marine recruits (N = 1,516). As anticipated, both RBD and GBD had a strong and consistent negative impact on mental health symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), independent of the contributions of gender and race. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that people of color are able to maintain resiliency (as measured by physical fitness testing) in the face of low levels of RBD, but are less able to overcome the negative effects of discrimination at high levels. It is interesting to note that the interaction between race, gender, and levels of discrimination was only found with objective physical fitness test scores but not with self-report measures.

We examined the effectiveness of experiential learning using the Workshop Activity for Gender Equity Simulation - Academic version (WAGES-Academic) to deliver gender inequity information. To assess whether the way gender inequity information is presented matters, we compared WAGES-Academic to an Information Only condition (knowledge without experiential learning) and a Group Activity control condition. We predicted that only the information presented in an experiential learning format (i. e., WAGES-Academic) would be retained because this information does not provoke reactance and instills self-efficacy. Participants (n=241; U. S. college students from a large mid-Atlantic state university) filled out a gender equity knowledge test at baseline, after the intervention, and then 7-11 days later (to assess knowledge retention). In addition, we measured feelings of reactance and self-efficacy after the intervention. Results revealed that participants in the WAGES condition retained more knowledge than the other conditions. Furthermore, the effect of WAGES vs. Information Only on knowledge was mediated by WAGES producing less reactance and greater feelings of self-efficacy.

But despite its negative consequences, benevolent sexism is a prevalent ideology that some even find attractive. To better understand why women and men alike might be motivated to adopt benevolent sexism, the current study tested system justification theory's prediction that benevolent sexism might have a positive linkage to life satisfaction through increased diffuse system justification, or the sense that the status quo is fair. A structural equation model revealed that benevolent sexism was positively associated with diffuse system justification within a sample of 274 college women and 111 college men. Additionally, benevolent sexism was indirectly associated with life satisfaction for both women and men through diffuse system justification. In contrast, hostile sexism was not related to diffuse system justification or life satisfaction. The results imply that although benevolent sexism perpetuates inequality at the structural level, it might offer some benefits at the personal level.

1317,"We examined the relationships between three forms of sexism (modern, benevolent, and hostile) and two components of attitudes toward gender-neutral language (attitudes toward gender-related language reforms and recognition of sexist language) across different contexts. A questionnaire study (N = 446) was conducted among students in the United Kingdom and in two (French- and German-speaking) regions of Switzerland. While we expected to find that all forms of sexism are generally related to negative attitudes toward gender-neutral language, we expected attitudes to be more positive and less related to sexist beliefs in a context in which genderneutral language is firmly established (the UK) compared to contexts in which the use of gender-neutral language was introduced only recently (the German-speaking part of Switzerland) or is still seldom (the French-speaking part of Switzerland). We found that, across all contexts, modern and hostile sexist beliefs were indeed related to negative attitudes toward gender-related language reforms, while, intriguingly, benevolent sexist beliefs were related to positive attitudes in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Recognition of sexist language was significantly related to modern sexism only. Finally, British students were found to express more positive attitudes toward gender-neutral language (both components) than Swiss students. © 2012 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.",2012-10-18,Journal,Article,Swiss Journal of Psychology,14780,40,71,"Sexism and attitudes toward gender-neutral language the case of English, French, and German",0,false,10.1024/1421-0185/a000078,,1317,Violence against Women,2012.0,78.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results showed that men whose masculinity was threatened responded by blaming the victim and exonerating the perpetrator more, while threatened women respond by blaming male perpetrators more and placing less blame on female victims.'}",13147707,Christin L.

1319,"As a first step in understanding the role that health care providers may play in observed gender disparities in HIV care in the United States, we sought to examine whether HIV providers' perceptions of and attitudes toward female and male patients differ. We used data from the Enhancing Communication to Improve HIV Outcomes (ECHO) study, a multisite, cross-sectional study focused on the role of the patient-provider relationship in disparities in HIV care conducted from October 2006 to June 2007. Using separate scales, we assessed HIV providers' perceptions about their patients (e.g., intelligence, compliance, responsibility) as well as providers' attitudes toward their patients (e.g., like, respect, frustrate). We used multivariable linear regression with generalized estimating equations to compare provider scores for female and male patients. Our sample comprised 37 HIV providers and 317 patients. Compared with male patients, HIV-infected females were less likely to be highly educated or employed, and more likely to report nonadherence to antiretroviral medications and depressive symptoms. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there was a significant difference in providers' perceptions of female and male patients, with providers having more negative perceptions of female patients. However, there was no significant difference in HIV providers' attitudes toward female and male patients in unadjusted or adjusted analyses.

1321,"© Oxford University Press, 2014.In this chapter, we describe theory and research that highlights connections between the social contexts of women's lives and women's intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning. Specifically, in the first section of the chapter, we discuss how women's social contexts are shaped by gender and its intersections with other social categories and by sexism expressed as prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Next, we discuss women's mental health, with attention to the interplay of gender with psychological disorders and the role of sexist discrimination in women's mental health. In the third section, we focus on women's relationships, starting with the socializing relationships of childhood, turning to intimate relationships in adulthood, and then discussing the role of power in women's relationships. Finally, we review research on women's identities, focusing on feminist, lesbian, and womanist identity models.

1322,"Learning science requires higher-level (critical) thinking skills that need to be practiced in science classes. This study tested the effect of exam format on critical-thinking skills. Multiple-choice (MC) testing is common in introductory science courses, and students in these classes tend to associate memorization with MC questions and may not see the need to modify their study strategies for critical thinking, because the MC exam format has not changed. To test the effect of exam format, I used two sections of an introductory biology class. One section was assessed with exams in the traditional MC format, the other section was assessed with both MC and constructed-response (CR) questions. The mixed exam format was correlated with significantly more cognitively active study behaviors and a significantly better performance on the cumulative final exam (after accounting for grade point average and gender). There was also less gender-bias in the CR answers. This suggests that the MC-only exam format indeed hinders critical thinking in introductory science classes. Introducing CR questions encouraged students to learn more and to be better critical thinkers and reduced gender bias. However, student resistance increased as students adjusted their perceptions of their own critical-thinking abilities. © 2012 K. F.

However, previous research has overlooked disgust's multiple evolved functions. Here, we investigated whether the link between disgust sensitivity and obesity stigma is specific to pathogen disgust, or whether sexual disgust and moral disgusttwo separate functional domainsalso relate to negative attitudes toward obese individuals. Additionally, we investigated whether sex differences exist in the manner disgust sensitivity predicts obesity stigma, whether the sexes differ across the subtypes of obesity bias independent of disgust sensitivity, and last, the association between participants' BMI and different subtypes of obesity stigma. In study 1 (N = 92), we established that obesity elicits pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust. In study 2, we investigated the relationship between these types of disgust sensitivity and obesity stigma. Participants (N = 387) reported their level of disgust toward various pathogen, sexual, and moral acts and their attitudes toward obese individuals. For women, but not men, increased pathogen disgust sensitivity predicted more negative attitudes toward obese individuals. Men reported more negative general attitudes toward obese individuals whereas women reported greater fear of becoming obese. The sexes also differed in how their own BMI related to the subtypes of obesity stigma. These findings indicate that pathogen disgust sensitivity plays a role in obesity stigma, specifically for women.

1326,"Past research regarding feminist identity has revealed that a significant number of women endorse feminist attitudes yet reject a feminist identity. In the current study, we sought to examine whether these nonlabeling women fall into two distinct groups: (a) one that falls on the same ideological continuum of their feminist peers and (b) the other that represents an attitudinally unique group of women characterized by their neoliberal beliefs that prioritize individual merit as the sole determinant of success. Two samples of undergraduate women self-reported their feminist identity and political and sexist attitudes. In our first sample (N = 231), we used k-means cluster analysis to identify two types of nonlabelers: quasi-feminists and neoliberals. Results revealed that, despite both groups' shared belief in gender equality, quasi-feminists reported relatively lower levels of meritocratic, just world, and modern sexist beliefs, all of which were similar to those of their feminist-identified peers, whereas neoliberals indicated stronger meritocratic, just world, and modern sexist beliefs. In our second sample (N = 351), we replicated findings from our first sample and subsequently validated these groupings. Specifically, multivariate analysis of variance results demonstrated that, separate from the differences found in relation to the measures used for cluster analysis, quasi-feminists scored lower than neoliberals on measures of ambivalent sexism, social dominance, and equal opportunity beliefs. Women's individual and collective welfare often hinges on their endorsement of neoliberal and feminist beliefs, especially in the face of unfair treatment. We suggest that activists and policy makers tailor strategies for engaging nonlabelers in the movement toward gender equality to the subtype of nonlabeler in question. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012-09-01,Journal,Article,Psychology of Women Quarterly,14035,23,36,Not All Nonlabelers Are Created Equal: Distinguishing Between Quasi-Feminists and Neoliberals,0,false,10.1177/0361684312451098,,1326,Journal of Social Psychology,2012.0,33.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study examined how endorsement of benevolent sexist ideologies predicts perceptions of requesters who use a term of endearment and of the female addressees who comply with their requests.'}",4078222,Alyssa M.

1331,"The connection between holding gender-traditional attitudes and the reluctance to identify as a feminist is well established, yet little is known about factors that might underlie this association. One factor that may serve this function is the tendency to hold negative stereotypes about feminists. Indeed, the constructs of ambivalent sexism (Glick and Fiske 1996) and ambivalence toward men (Glick and Fiske 1999) provide a strong theoretical basis for the prediction that traditional attitudes toward women and men are related to the derogation of women who do not conform to the feminine-stereotyped gender role. Therefore, the present study utilized path analysis to test a mediational model in which traditional attitudes toward women and men predict the tendency to stereotype feminists, which in turn predicts feminist identity. The present study also examined whether the relations between the variables in the model differed for African American, European American, and Latina women. Participants consisted of 544 women from the southern United States who, despite being undergraduates, were in their mid-to-late twenties on average. As expected, participant ethnicity moderated the paths in the model. Among African American and Latina women, hostility toward men and hostile sexism predicted the tendency to stereotype feminists, which then predicted feminist identity. Support for the mediational model was not obtained among European American women; instead, the model for European American women was characterized by direct paths from traditional attitudes toward women and men to feminist identity.

1333,"Sexual and relationship violence are two major public health issues that affect an alarming number of undergraduate students. As a result, many colleges and universities have protocols to serve victims of these forms of violence. Despite federal legislation stating that all students should have equitable experiences, current protocols and programs focus primarily on heterosexual students. College student victims of sexual and relationship violence who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender can face particular challenges, including disclosure of their sexual and gender orientations, and revictimization when seeking services.

1335,"Two experiments examined responses to bystanders who claimed that another person experienced discrimination. Participants read about a woman or man who experienced sexism and whose co-worker (male or female) either expressed sympathy or claimed that the target experienced sexism. Participants then evaluated the co-worker (bystander). Overall, participants evaluated bystanders who claimed that someone else experienced discrimination more negatively than they evaluated bystanders who did not claim discrimination. Furthermore, female bystanders who claimed discrimination on behalf of someone else were derogated more than male bystanders who did the same. Additional analyses indicated that female bystanders who claimed that another person experienced discrimination were derogated more than male bystanders who did so because the former threatened participants' beliefs about the fairness of status differences to a greater extent than the later. © The Author(s) 2011.",2012-07-01,Journal,Article,Group Processes and Intergroup Relations,14946,46,15,It's not your fault: The social costs of claiming discrimination on behalf of someone else,0,false,10.1177/1368430211432894,,1335,Sex Roles,2012.0,0.0,0.0,,4868802,G.

1336,"The purpose of this study was to examine the reactions of women and men who observe misogyny. The authors examined the emotional distress associated with observing misogyny, and the degree to which this varied based on (a) reading about or actually observing the incivility, (b) political orientation, and (c) religiosity. Participants (n = 205 US college students) took part in a between subjects experiment where they either heard or read about one of two scenarios: two men making a disparaging comment about a woman while she was out of the room, or a situation in which no comment was made. Results indicate that women, but not men, overestimated their emotional distress to observing misogyny. For women, but not men, whether or not the misogynistic comment was heard also interacted with religiosity to predict emotional distress. Political orientation did not have an effect on women and men's reactions.

1337,"Across two studies, we tested whether perceived social costs and benefits of confrontation would similarly predict confronting discrimination both when it was experienced and when it was observed as directed at others. Female undergraduate participants were asked to recall past experiences and observations of sexism, as well as their confronting behaviors. Path modeling in Study 1 (N = 148) demonstrated that women were more likely to report confronting if they believed that the confrontation would make a difference (perceived benefits), or they were less concerned about social sanctions (perceived costs), and the prediction patterns were similar for both experienced and observed sexism. Study 2 (N = 166) replicated the results of Study 1, as well as tested the moderating influence of gender identification. In situations of higher perceived social costs, women who were less strongly identified with their gender group were more responsive to the perceived benefits of the confrontation when deciding whether to confront on behalf of the self. The results of the two studies suggest that researchers should investigate methods for enhancing perceived social benefits and reducing perceived social costs when designing intervention programs aimed at increasing confrontation and decreasing the prevalence of discrimination. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012-06-01,Journal,Article,Psychology of Women Quarterly,14035,65,36,When Do We Confront?

1338,"A questionnaire study addressed the intergenerational transmission of benevolent sexist beliefs (BS) from mothers to adolescent daughters and influences of BS on daughters' traditional goals, academic goals (i. e., getting an academic degree), and academic performance. In addition, the role of mothers' educational level and job status as predictors of their BS was explored. One hundred sixty-four pairs of female adolescents and their mothers from Granada (Spain) completed questionnaires independently. Hypotheses were tested in a path model. Results suggest that mothers' BS is negatively predicted by their education but not their job status. Mothers' BS predicted daughters' BS, which in turn negatively predicted daughters'goal to get an academic degree and positively predicted daughters' traditional goals. Daughters' academic performance was positively predicted by their goal to get an academic degree and negatively predicted by mothers' BS.

1339,"Although the number of women entering medical school has been steadily rising in the USA, female medical students continue to report instances of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. The full spectrum of such experiences and their effect on the professional identity formation of female students over time remains largely unknown. To investigate these experiences, we interviewed 12 third year female medical students at a private New England medical school over several points during the 2006-2007 academic year. Using theoretical frameworks of gender performance and the centrality of student-patient and student-supervisor relationships, we were better able to understand how female medical students interpret the role of 'woman doctor' and the effect of negative and positive gendered interactions on the evolution of their professional identity. We found that participants quickly learned how to confront and respond to inappropriate behavior from male patients and found interactions with female patients and supervisors particularly rewarding. However, they did not feel equipped to respond to the unprofessional behavior of male supervisors, resulting in feelings of guilt and resignation over time that such events would be a part of their professional identity. The rapid acculturation to unprofessional behavior and resignation described by participants has implications for not only professional identity formation of female students but specialty choices and issues of future physician workforce. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012-04-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,83,74,"""I'm too used to it"": A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education",1,true,10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.043,,1339,Scandinavian Journal of Psychology,2012.0,39.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study tested predictions regarding ambivalent sexism between groups from different organizational settings and revealed that men scored higher on hostile and benevolent sexism than women, and high school students scored higher than both adult samples on both forms of sexism.'}",7293320,Ingrid Zakrisson,108591658,Maria Anderzén,7430719,Fredrik Lenell,40293453,Håkan Sandelin,,,,,15.0,426.0,8.0,5.0,253.0,3.0,20.0,1798.0,15.0,113.0,2934.0,27.0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Medicine"
1340,"This study tested predictions regarding ambivalent sexism, previously studied cross-culturally, here ""within-culturally"", between groups from different organizational settings. Based on three samples (334 adults in general, 744 industrial employees, and 189 high school students), completing a Swedish version of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), the results revealed that men scored higher on hostile and benevolent sexism than women, and high school students scored higher than both adult samples on both forms of sexism. The results generally confirmed the predictions; the gender gap in benevolent sexism decreased as a function of increasing levels of general sexism and the correlation between hostile and benevolent sexism decreased with higher levels of general sexism. In fact, the groups scoring highest on general sexism displayed significant negative correlations indicating a polarized ideology of women among these groups.

1342,"The current research draws from ambivalent sexism theory to examine potential gender differences in the quantity and quality of developmental work experiences. In a sample of managers in the energy industry, men and women reported participating in a similar number of developmental experiences (with comparable levels of support), but men rated these experiences as more challenging and received more negative feedback than did women. Similarly, a sample of female managers in the health care industry reported comparable amounts, but less challenging types, of developmental experiences than their male counterparts'. The results of three complementary experiments suggest that benevolent sexism is negatively related to men's assignment of challenging experiences to female targets but that men and women were equally likely to express interest in challenging experiences. Taken together, these results suggest that stereotype-based beliefs that women should be protected may limit women's exposure to challenging assignments, which in turn may partially explain the underrepresentation of women at the highest levels of organizations. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Management,20635,118,38,Benevolent Sexism at Work: Gender Differences in the Distribution of Challenging Developmental Experiences,0,false,10.1177/0149206310365902,SAGE Publications Inc.claims@sagepub.com,1342,International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,2012.0,29.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The horizons of maternal and reproductive health should extend to include the life cycle of healthy changes and illness that are embodied in longer life for women.'}",4740674,F.

1343,"Cancer, particularly when it affects women and reproductive health, epitomizes the complexities and inequities of the epidemiological challenge faced by low- and middle-income countries. Women in resource-poor settings face a double cancer burden: the backlog of preventable cancer, and the emerging challenge of cancers that cannot be prevented but whose impact could be dramatically reduced through early detection and treatment. Disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and other health and non-health outcomes are exacerbated by gender inequity and compounded by discrimination and stigma. The combination of these barriers implies a multiplicative challenge for women who face cancer, particularly when the disease is associated with reproduction.

1345,"This study examined the relationship between perceived climate for women and job satisfaction in a male-dominated context, focusing on moderating variables which may augment or decrease this relationship for men. Specifically, it was predicted that job satisfaction will be lower for women and men in a male-dominated context when they perceive a negative climate for women, but that this relationship will be moderated for men based on the levels of support and exclusion they experience. Using a sample of 239 (75. 7% male) professors, staff, graduate assistants, and undergraduate assistants in a male-dominated science department of a large Midwestern university, we found that perceptions of a negative climate for women were significantly related to lower reports of job satisfaction for both women and men.

1346,"Background: We conducted a study among HIV-positive men and women in Honduras to describe demographics, HIV risk behaviors and sexually transmitted infection prevalence, and identify correlates of unsafe sex. Methods: Participants were recruited from HIV clinics and nongovernmental organizations in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, Honduras in a cross-sectional study in 2006. We used audio-assisted computer interviews on demographics; behaviors in the past 12 months, 6 months, and 30 days; and access to care. Assays performed included herpes (HSV-2 Herpes Select), syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR] and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TPPA]) serology, and other sexually transmitted infections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess variables associated with unprotected sex across all partner types in the past 12 months. Results: Of 810 participants, 400 were from Tegucigalpa and 410 from San Pedro Sula; 367 (45%) were men. Mean age was 37 years (interquartile range: 31-43).
