1,"© 2022 by the authors.While the right to food and community self-reliance underpin current knowledge and interpretation of community food security (CFS), the literature on CFS seldom accounts for the ways in which gender-based violence (GBV) disrupts and undermines CFS. In this review, we make the case that GBV in CFS contexts manifests as a continuum, involving different forms of violence that blend into and reinforce each other, fueling social degradation and undermining the capacity of community food system workers to prioritise and pursue CFS. We show that harms to CFS resulting from GBV manifest through (i) GBV-induced social degradation, (ii) erosion of moral and ethical values anchoring CFS, (iii) disruption of crucial food systems sustainability pathways to CFS, (iv) the challenges, behaviours and activities of community food system workers, and (v) the crippling of community-level on-farm and off-farm food value chains, which oftentimes disrupt food access, consumption and utilisation. We further outline that the diversion of CFS funds into GBV prevention services may reduce CFS-related economic outputs and that CFS efforts that are GBV-blind can undermine the agency of community food system workers, pushing them into decisions that undermine CFS. We conclude that there is a dearth of information on how to mainstream GBV-sensitivity into CFS plans, and it is unclear whether GBV-responsive CFS initiatives can enhance the legitimacy of CFS efforts in GBV-exposed settings. We suggest that the spectrum of what is considered “community” in relation to CFS be expanded; and that scholars and practitioners pay attention to the dynamics of GBV, focusing on how GBV occurring at individual and household levels spills over into communities to undermine CFS. Finally, since GBV is not only a human rights violation issue but also a catalyst for social degradation and food insecurity, we encourage refocusing CFS efforts to prioritise early detection and prevention of GBV across specific community-level, on-farm and off-farm food value chains in order to better enhance community ties and foster food security.",2022-12-01,Journal,Review,Land,21100811521,0,11,Harms to Community Food Security Resulting from Gender-Based Violence,1,true,10.3390/land11122335,MDPI,Land,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,1,7366790,U.

2,"© 2022 Camargo Freile et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License,Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes assaults that risk a woman’s bodily integrity. Intimate partners commit IPV, people with whom the victim shares (or shared) a close personal or sexual relationship. This phenomenon has a great global and national impact. Thus, it is necessary to establish trends of the risk of physical violence to women by their current or former partner in each department of Colombia and its relationship with sociodemographic and health characteristics. This study uses an ecological approach at the departmental level, with victims of intimate partner violence treated at the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (INMLyCF). Potential factors were identified through Bayesian factor analysis and were included in the model to estimate risk. The findings show that the Casanare department had the highest risk of producing victims (SMR: 2.545). In departments where the educational level of women is at or below primary school, there is a high-risk β = 0.343 (0.285, 0.397) of them being assaulted. For the departments in which the employment of women is in sales and services or office workers, the associated factor presents a higher risk β = 0.361 (0.201, 0.485), as in the risk related to affiliation with the social security system β = 0.338 (0.246, 0.498), as well as sexual and reproductive life β = 0.143 (0.003, 0.322). The following categories were associated with physical gender violence: no education and low participation in making purchases at home β = 0.106 (0.049, 0.199), low participation in decisions about their health, and visits to family and friends β = 0.240 (0.170, 0.299). Therefore, public health programs should strengthen women’s empowerment in household decisions and increase their educational level to reduce this incidence.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,17,Risk of violence from a current or former partner: Associated factors and classification in a nationwide study in Colombia,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0279444,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2022.0,35.0,0.0,,2,2197842398,Isaac Esteban Camargo Freile,2146297045,K.

3,"© 2022 by the authors.The objective was to investigate the validity and reliability of a new instrument assessing sexual harassment at a public university in Sweden. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions resulted in a 10-item instrument, the ‘Lund University Sexual Harassment Inventory’ (LUSHI). A survey was sent to all staff, including PhD students, and students, with a response rate of 33% (n = 2736) and 32% (n = 9667), respectively. Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha statistics were applied. Having experienced one or more of 10 specific behaviors was defined as sexual harassment exposure and was reported by 17.1% of staff/PhD students and 21.1% of students. Exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors with Eigenvalues above 1, labeled ‘unwanted sexual attention of soliciting type’ and ‘unwanted sexual attention of non-soliciting type’. Rape/attempted rape fell outside of the two factors. The Cronbach’s alpha values of the original 10-item scale and of the two newly formed scales were 0.80, 0.80, and 0.66, respectively. The mentioned statistics were markedly similar among men, women, and non-binary individuals and between staff/PhD students and students.

4,"© 2022 by the authors.There is growing recognition that greenspace provides invaluable benefits to health and wellbeing, and is essential infrastructure for promoting both social and environmental sustainability in urban settings. This paper contributes towards efforts to build ‘just’ and equitable urban sustainability, and more specifically greenspace management, by drawing attention to hostility and exclusion experienced by two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, genderqueer, pansexual, transsexual, intersex and gender-variant (2SLGBTQ+) park occupants. There is evidence that access to greenspace is inequitable—despite ongoing media accounts of targeted violence and discriminatory police patrolling of 2SLGBTQ+ communities in urban parks, this population has not received adequate research attention. This paper examines systemic barriers that impede urban greenspace access among 2SLGBTQ+ communities, including how the threat of violence in greenspace limits opportunities for accessing benefits associated with naturalized settings. These themes are explored within the context of the City of Toronto, Canada. Our mixed-method approach draws upon key informant interviews, key document content analysis, and ground-truthing. Our findings reveal how queer corporeality, kinship and love subvert deeply entrenched heteronormative social values and understandings of sexuality, partnership, gender, and use of public space, challenging institutional understandings of morality and daily life. The paper concludes by reflecting on the state of 2SLGBTQ+ communities’ relationships to greenspace, and potential ways forward in building greater inclusivity into the social fabric of park design and management.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,Strengthening Equity and Inclusion in Urban Greenspace: Interrogating the Moral Management & Policing of 2SLGBTQ+ Communities in Toronto Parks,1,true,10.3390/ijerph192315505,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,66.0,0.0,,4,49449492,C.

5,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Ending preventable maternal deaths remains a challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Society perceived causes and real-life observations can reveal the intangible causes of maternal deaths irrespective of formal maternal death investigations. This study reports complex patterns in which social determinants act towards paving the path to maternal deaths in a rural Sri Lankan setting. Methods: We conducted social autopsies for 15/18 maternal deaths (in two consecutive years during the past decade) in district A (pseudonymized). In-depth interviews of 43 respondents and observations were recorded in the same field sites. During thematic analysis, identified themes were further classified according to the World Health Organization framework for social determinants of health (SDH). The patterns between themes and clustering of social determinants based on the type of maternal deaths were analyzed using mixed methods. Results: Discernable social causes underpinned 12 out of 15 maternal deaths. Extreme poverty, low educational level, gender inequity, and elementary or below-level occupations of the husband were the characteristic structural determinants of most deceased families. Social isolation was the commonest leading cause manifesting as a reason for many other social factors and resulted in poor social support paving the path to most maternal deaths. A core set of poverty, social isolation, and poor social support acted together with alcohol usage, and violence leading to suicides. These core determinants mediating through neglected self-health care led to delay in health-seeking. Deficits in quality of care and neglect were noted at health institutions and the field. Conclusion: Social autopsies of maternal deaths revealed complex social issues and social determinants of health leading to maternal deaths in Sri Lanka, indicating the need for a socially sensitive health system.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Reproductive Health,144680,0,19,Social determinants of health pave the path to maternal deaths in rural Sri Lanka: reflections from social autopsies,1,true,10.1186/s12978-022-01527-2,BioMed Central Ltd,Reproductive Health,2022.0,59.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is of prime importance to identify social causes leading to deaths of women during pregnancy and postpartum, as prevention of these is possible through simple multisectoral interventions.'}",5,2193598686,Lasandha Irangani,2085861414,I.

6,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: There is an increasing focus on readiness of health systems to respond to survivors of violence against women (VAW), a global human rights violation damaging women’s health. Health system readiness focuses on how prepared healthcare systems and institutions, including providers and potential users, are to adopt changes brought about by the integration of VAW care into services. In VAW research, such assessment is often limited to individual provider readiness or facility-level factors that need to be strengthened, with less attention to health system dimensions. The paper presents a framework for health system readiness assessment to improve quality of care for intimate partner violence (IPV), which was tested in Brazil and Palestinian territories (oPT). Methods: Data synthesis of primary data from 43 qualitative interviews with healthcare providers and health managers in Brazil and oPT to explore readiness in health systems. Results: The application of the framework showed that it had significant added value in capturing system capabilities - beyond the availability of material and technical capacity - to encompass stakeholder values, confidence, motivation and connection with clients and communities. Our analysis highlighted two missing elements within the initial framework: client and community engagement and gender equality issues. Subsequently, the framework was finalised and organised around three levels of analysis: macro, meso and micro. The micro level highlighted the need to also consider how the system can sustainably involve and interact with clients (women) and communities to ensure and promote readiness for integrating (and participating in) change. Addressing cultural and gender norms around IPV and enhancing support and commitment from health managers was also shown to be necessary for a health system environment that enables the integration of IPV care. Conclusion: The proposed framework helps identify a) system capabilities and pre-conditions for system readiness; b) system changes required for delivering quality care for IPV; and c) connections between and across system levels and capabilities.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,BMC Health Services Research,28098,0,22,Improving health system readiness to address violence against women and girls: a conceptual framework,1,true,10.1186/s12913-022-08826-1,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Health Services Research,2022.0,76.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Addressing cultural and gender norms around IPV and enhancing support and commitment from health managers was also shown to be necessary for a health system environment that enables the integration of IPV care.'}",6,39092804,M.

7,"© 2022, The Author(s).Purpose of Review: Incels (involuntary celibates) have recently garnered media attention for seemingly random attacks of violence. Much attention has centered around the misogynistic and violent discourse that has taken place in online incel forums as well as manifestos written by incels who have perpetrated deadly attacks. Such work overlooks the experiences and issues faced by incels themselves, the majority of which have not engaged in any violent behavior. Recent Findings: A small number of studies have recruited incels. Results from these studies highlight the nuanced nature of the incel identity. It is also apparent that incels suffer from high levels of romantic rejection and a greater degree of depressive and anxious symptoms, insecure attachment, fear of being single, and loneliness.

Second, we identify barriers to including alcohol use in sexual assault programs and provide recommendations to overcome these barriers. Recent Findings: We identified six sexual assault programs that also include alcohol use content, four of which have yet to be rigorously evaluated. To further refine sexual assault prevention efforts, we identified four barriers that need to be overcome including (1) alcohol and sexual assault prevention efforts which are currently siloed, (2) fear of victim blaming when integrating alcohol into programs for women, (3) a lack of evidence on how alcohol impacts bystanders, and (4) uncertainty about how to include content related to alcohol and sexual consent communicated.

10,"© The Author(s) 2022.Despite widespread community concern about the incidence of lethal violence against women in Australia, the numbers and rates of women murdered each year have been falling for almost 30 years. The risk of homicide victimisation among Australian women is now the lowest it has ever been since federation. Few studies have explored these patterns or sought to explain their development. One plausible explanation, anticipated by feminist theories of violence, is that homicide has declined as the status of women and gender equality have increased. In this paper, I analyse changes in the annual female homicide victimisation rate in Australia from 1962 to 2016. Using unobserved components models, I investigate the extent to which increases in either the status of women or gender equality can account for the decline in female homicide victimisation since the late 1980s. Despite absolute and relative advances in women's educational access and achievement, labour force participation, and earnings, those changes had little discernible impact on the aggregate-level risk of lethal violence against women. Instead, other social and economic conditions, such as falling unemployment, the shrinking of the young male population and ongoing urbanisation, seem better able to explain recent improvements in women's safety.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Criminology,21101052765,0,55,The drop in female homicide victimisation in Australia,1,true,10.1177/26338076221110251,SAGE Publications Ltd,Journal of Criminology,2022.0,109.0,0.0,,10,145329710,W.

11,"© 2022 The AuthorsAmong patients of an urban primary care network in Philadelphia with a universal hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening policy for patients born during 1945–1965, we examined whether being unscreened and HCV positivity were associated with attributes of the census tracts where patients resided, which we considered as proxies for social health determinants. For patients with at least one clinic visit between 2014 and mid-2017, we linked demographic and HCV screening information from electronic health records with metrics that described the census tracts where patients resided. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRs) for being unscreened and HCV positive. Overall, 28% of 6,906 patients were unscreened. Black race, male gender, and residence in census tracts with relatively high levels of violent crime, low levels of educational attainment and household incomes, and evidence of residential segregation by Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower aRRs for being unscreened. Among screened patients, 9% were HCV positive. Factors associated with lower risks of being unscreened were, in general, associated with higher HCV positivity. Attributes of census tracts where patients reside are probably less apparent to clinicians than patients’ gender or race but might reflect unmeasured patient characteristics that affected screening practices, along with preconceptions regarding the likelihood of HCV infection based on prior screening observations or implicit biases. Approaching complete detection of HCV-infected people would be hastened by focusing on residents of census tracts with attributes associated with higher infection levels or, if known, higher infection levels directly.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Preventive Medicine Reports,21100372295,0,30,Patient characteristics and neighborhood attributes associated with hepatitis C screening and positivity in Philadelphia,1,true,10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.102011,Elsevier Inc.,Preventive medicine reports,2022.0,32.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Among patients of an urban primary care network in Philadelphia with a universal hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening policy for patients born during 1945–1965, it is examined whether being unscreened and HCV positivity were associated with attributes of the census tracts where patients resided, which were considered as proxies for social health determinants.'}",11,9768870,D.

12,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Policymakers worldwide took measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19-virus. While these sanitary measures were necessary to fight the spread of the virus, several experts warned for a significant impact on mental health and a potential increase in domestic violence. To study the impact of the COVID-19 measures in Belgium, and the factors influencing the occurrence of domestic violence, we set up the study on relationships, stress, and aggression. In this study, we evaluate the prevalence of domestic violence victimization during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgian children aged zero to seventeen years and the associations of the parents’ financial status, relationships, mental health, and previous victimization to the child’s victimization. Methods: A stepwise forward binary logistic regression was used to analyse the association between multiple risk factors of domestic violence and victimization of the respondent’s child. The respondent being an assailant, the respondent’s age, and the age of the children in the household were added as moderators. Results: In this model an association with domestic child abuse was found for the age of the respondent, the household’s size, the presence of children between zero and five years in the household, the perceived stress level of the respondent, and victimization of the respondent during the first wave of the sanitary measures, as well as victimization before the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the interacting effects were found to be significant. Conclusion: It is advisable to make extra efforts to improve well-being when maintaining sanitary measures by providing appropriate assistance and helping households struggling with increased or acute stress to install positive coping strategies - especially in larger households with children between six and 17 years. Besides, our findings draw attention to the clustering of risk of child and adult violence exposure in lockdown situations as well as to the potential cumulative impact of exposure to violence across the lifespan and across generations. It is key to invest in training healthcare workers and staff at schools to screen for and assess risks of domestic violence development and ongoing or past occurrence in order to detect, refer and follow-up on families at risk.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,BMC Public Health,19621,0,22,Locked up at home: a cross-sectional study into the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on domestic violence in households with children in Belgium,1,true,10.1186/s12889-022-14135-3,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Public Health,2022.0,64.0,0.0,,12,102173719,E.

14,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Purpose of Review: This article reviews the literature on youth violent trauma reinjury regarding relevant demographic and clinical risk factors, reinjury characteristics, and the effectiveness of existing violence intervention (VIP) programs aimed at reducing reinjury. Recent Findings: The literature suggests that black race, being an older teenager, male sex, disadvantaged socioeconomic status, and having mental health conditions are risk factors for violent trauma reinjury. Experiencing an injury from violent trauma increases the likelihood of presenting with another violent injury and also increases the risk of mortality. Additionally, current VIP programs do not consistently demonstrate reinjury reduction and tend to be brief, temporary, and have short follow-up. Summary: There remains limited data on youth violent trauma reinjury and its risk factors. Also, VIP programs have exhibited mixed results regarding reinjury reduction. Continued assessment and research of predisposing features related to pediatric and young adult violent trauma reinjury is critically important.",2022-12-01,Journal,Review,Current Trauma Reports,21100854825,0,8,Violent Trauma Reinjury and Preventive Interventions in Youth: a Literature Review,0,false,10.1007/s40719-022-00242-4,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Current Trauma Reports,2022.0,48.0,0.0,,14,8019648,Christina Georgeades,3961818,A.

15,"© 2022 Elsevier Masson SASAims: Abuse of the elderly is an important public health problem. In this paper, we aimed to study gender differences in the victim profiles of elderly people and report on the medical and medico-legal consequences of these acts of violence. Methods: We conducted a descriptive and analytical retrospective study over a period of 6 months (July–December 2020) including all cases of physical violence against subjects aged 60 and over who consulted the Forensic Medicine Department of the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital of Sfax, Tunisia. Results: We collected 110 cases. The prevalence of physical violence towards elderly people was 8.14 per hundred thousand inhabitants. The gender ratio (M/F) was 0.93 and median age was 67 years. We noted a difference in victim profiles between males and females. Indeed, women were more often not working (44.5%), and victims of family violence (38.2%). Men were in a number of cases day laborers (21.8%) whose attacker did not belong to the family sphere (33.6%). The Total Temporary Disability (TTD) period was associated with the presence of injuries to the trunk (P = 0.004), to the lower limbs (P = 0.009) or to bone fractures (P:0.001) for female victims. For men, the duration of TTD was associated with the type of weapon (P < 0.001), cephalic location of injuries (P = 0.007), the presence of upper limb injuries (P:0.006) or linear wounds (P < 0.001). In addition, Permanent Partial Disability (PPD), predicted in 20.9% of the cases, was related to gender (P:0.021). Among women, the prediction of PPD was associated with contusion injuries (P:0.011) and bone fractures (P < 0.001). For male victims, the prediction of PPD depended on the type of weapon (P:0.024), cephalic location of injuries (P:0.008) and simple wounds (P:0.024). Finally, a period of about 9 days (TTD) constituted a threshold from which the occurrence of a PPD was predictable. Conclusion: Violence against the elderly is a serious phenomenon with severe consequences. For older women, the organic law of 2017 needs to be better known and better applied in our country. However, new legislation to more efficiently protect the elderly against physical violence would be desirable in our country. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SASIntroduction: Les personnes âgées, fragiles et vulnérables, peuvent être victimes de maltraitance. Objectifs: Dans ce travail sur les violences physiques perpétrées à l'encontre des sujets âgés, il a été rapporté les caractéristiques victimologiques selon le genre de la victime et les conséquences médicales et médico-légales de ces violences. Matériel et méthodes: Etude rétrospective, sur une période de 6 mois (juillet–décembre 2020) portant sur tous les cas de violences physiques volontaires envers des sujets âgés de 60 ans et plus ayant consulté au service de Médecine Légale du CHU Habib Bourguiba de Sfax, Tunisie. Résultats: Il a été colligé 110 cas avec un sexe ratio (H/F) de 0,93. Le profil victimologique des victimes était différent selon le genre. En effet, les femmes étaient le plus souvent sans profession (44,5 % des cas), victimes de violence familiale (38,2 % des cas). Quant aux hommes, ils étaient dans la plupart des cas des ouvriers journaliers (21,8 % des cas) dont l'agresseur n'appartenait pas à la sphère familiale (33,6 % des cas). Dans les suites de ces violences, la durée de l'incapacité temporaire totale (ITT) était associée à la présence de lésions au niveau du tronc (p = 0,004), au niveau des membres inférieurs (p = 0,009) ou d'une fracture osseuse (p = 0,001) pour les victimes de sexe féminin. Quant aux hommes, la durée d'ITT était significativement associée au type d'arme utilisé (p < 0,001), à la localisation céphalique de lésions (p = 0,007) ou à la présence de lésions au niveau des membres supérieurs (p = 0,006) ou à la présence de plaie linéaire (p < 0,001). L'incapacité partielle permanente (IPP), prévue dans 20,9 % des cas, dépendait du genre de la victime (p = 0,021), avec une prédominance masculine. Chez les femmes, la prévision d'IPP était associée à la présence de plaies contuses (p = 0,011) ou d'une fracture osseuse (p < 0,001). Pour les victimes de sexe masculin, la prévision d'IPP dépendait du type de l'arme utilisée (p = 0,024), de la localisation céphalique des lésions (p = 0,008) et de la présence de plaies simples (p = 0,024). Enfin, une durée d'ITT avoisinant les 9 jours représentait le seuil à partir duquel la survenue d'une IPP était prévisible au stade lésionnel. Conclusion: La violence à l'encontre du sujet âgé est un phénomène grave avec des conséquences sévères. Pour les femmes âgées, la loi organique de 2017 doit être mieux connue et mieux appliquée dans notre pays.

16,"© 2022, The Author(s).Purpose: The present study examines the association between psychological violence and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, while comparing the specific subtypes of psychological violence and simultaneously focusing on methodological shortcomings. Method: A systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses were applied on the three main outcomes: PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Four electronic databases were searched (PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science), and a total of 194 studies were included (k = 149 for meta-analyses). GRADEpro was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence from the meta-analyses. Results: Psychological violence had strong associations with the three main outcomes, with the strongest association for PTSD in both female and male victims. Coercive control was particularly associated with PTSD for female victims, while emotional/verbal and dominance/isolation had the strongest association with depression. Although the identified studies were characterized by gender bias, psychological violence appear to affect male mental health too. Discussion: Findings from the meta-analyses support the notion that psychological violence is a traumatic experience, which is strongly association with PTSD and other common mental health problems linked to trauma. GRADEpro rated the certainty of evince to be low, and thus, our confidence in the estimated effect is limited. Gender bias, the applied terminology, and other methodological shortcomings are discussed. Despite the substantial amount of research on this topic, more research is needed before we can draw any final conclusions on the effect of psychological violence on mental health.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Systematic Reviews,21100237425,0,11,The psychological subtype of intimate partner violence and its effect on mental health: a systematic review with meta-analyses,1,true,10.1186/s13643-022-02025-z,BioMed Central Ltd,Systematic Reviews,2022.0,109.0,0.0,,16,3833506,S.

17,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdStigma-related stress and inflated perceptions of substance use norms are positioned in the literature as theoretically distinct explanations for disproportionate substance use among sexual minorities. As research has yet to examine how these variables may interact in an intervention context, this study examined the impact of recent experiences with violence and harassment due to sexual minority status (i.e., interpersonal stigma exposure) on the effectiveness of a culturally adapted personalized normative feedback intervention for lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ) women. A sub-sample of 499 moderate-to-heavy drinking LBQ women were randomized to receive personalized normative feedback (PNF) on alcohol use or control topics within a broader digital competition designed to challenge negative LBQ stereotypes. At baseline, recent interpersonal stigma exposure strengthened the relationship between perceived LBQ alcohol-related norms and participants’ own alcohol-related behaviors (i.e., consumption and consequences). At follow-up, 3 months later, recent interpersonal stigma exposure moderated the effectiveness of alcohol PNF with substantially less drinking and consequences among participants in the treatment condition reporting recent violence or harassment due to sexual minority status, relative to those reporting no such experiences. Underscoring the utility of PNF for LBQ women and potentially other heavy drinking stigmatized populations, findings suggest that a greater tendency to conform to over-estimated ingroup drinking norms may be another way in which minority status-based violence and harassment contributes to alcohol consumption in stigmatized populations.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Addictive Behaviors,24763,0,135,Exposure to interpersonal stigma enhances the effectiveness of a culturally adapted personalized normative feedback alcohol intervention for sexual minority women,0,false,10.1016/j.addbeh.2022.107453,Elsevier Ltd,Addictive Behaviours,2022.0,43.0,0.0,,17,37408535,Sarah C.

18,"© 2022, The New York Academy of Medicine.Sleep disparities in sexual minority male (SMM) populations have received relatively little attention but they may be critical to explaining other health disparities seen among SMM, via neural or hormonal pathways. Recent research suggests that crime may be a psychosocial stressor that contributes to sleep disparities but that finding has been based on subjective measures of crime. We conducted the P18 Neighborhood Study of 250 SMM in New York City, including 211 with adequate GPS tracking data. We used the GPS tracking data to define daily path area activity spaces and tested the associations of violent crime in those activity spaces and in the subject’s residential neighborhood, perceived neighborhood safety, and witnessing crime with a subjective measure of sleep. Using quasi-Poisson regression, adjusted for individual and neighborhood socio-demographics, we found that SMM who witnessed more types of crime experienced significantly more nights of poor sleep over the course of a month (RR: 1.16, 95%CI: 1.05–1.27, p-value: < 0.01). We did not find any associations between violent crime rates in either the activity area or residential area and sleep. Our findings support the conclusion that personal exposure to crime is associated with sleep problems and provide further evidence for the pathway between stress and sleep. The lack of association between neighborhood crime levels and sleep suggests that there must be personal experience with crime and ambient presence is insufficient to produce an effect.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Urban Health,16448,0,99,Objective and Subjective Neighborhood Crime Associated with Poor Sleep among Young Sexual Minority Men: a GPS Study,0,false,10.1007/s11524-022-00674-y,Springer,Journal of urban health,2022.0,68.0,0.0,,18,2180570336,Benjamin D.

19,"© 2022Background: Researchers in studies from multiple countries suggest that sexual and gender minority people experience high rates of violence, stigma, and discrimination, as well as mistrust of health care providers and systems. Despite growing evidence related to sexual and gender minority health in North America and Europe, we know little about the health of this population in the Middle East and North Africa. Objectives: We aimed to comprehensively examine the literature related to the health of sexual and gender minority people in the Middle East and North Africa and to identify research gaps and priorities. Design: We conducted a scoping review informed by the framework recommended by Arksey and O'Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) tool. Data sources: We searched the following databases: PubMed (using Medline All on the Ovid platform), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), and Embase (Ovid). The search strategy combined terms for the geographic region of interest (Middle East and North Africa) and the population of interest (sexual and gender minority). Each was operationalized using multiple search terms and, where available, controlled vocabulary terms. Review Methods: Research articles were identified and assessed for inclusion using an explicit strategy. Relevant information was extracted and synthesized to present a descriptive summary of existing evidence. Results: Research designs of the 98 articles we reviewed included quantitative (n = 73), qualitative (n = 20), and mixed methods (n = 5). Most studies were conducted in Lebanon (n = 33), Pakistan (n = 32), and Iran (n = 23) and focused mainly on gender minority individuals (n = 46) and men who have sex with men (n = 32). Five themes emerged from the review: sexual health (52; 53%); mental health (20; 20%); gender identity (17; 17%); violence and discrimination (7; 7%); and experiences with the healthcare system (2; 2%). Although researchers focused on multiple health outcomes in some studies, we included them under the theme most closely aligned with the main objective of the study. Conclusion: Although our study is limited to few countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, we found that sexual and gender minority individuals face multiple adverse sexual and mental health outcomes and experience high rates of stigma, discrimination, and violence. More research is needed from countries outside of Lebanon, Pakistan, and Iran, including community-based participatory approaches and multi-level intervention development.

20,"© The Author(s) 2022.Korean refugee women are at risk of multiple violent victimizations throughout the migration phases. However, migration's association with mental health outcomes has received little scholarly attention. This study examined North Korean refugee women's exposure to polyvictimization—exposure to both gender-based violence (GBV) and intimate partner violence (IPV)—and explored whether polyvictimization is associated with an increased risk of psychological symptoms. Data from a snowball sample of 212 North Korean refugee women were analyzed. Polyvictimization was operationalized as No victimization (0), Only GBV (1), Only IPV (2), and Both GBV and IPV (3). The associations between polyvictimization and depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and alcohol use disorder were analyzed with multivariate analyses. Results demonstrated that 46.2% experienced GBV in either North Korea or intermediary countries, and 30.9% were victims of IPV from their current intimate partner in South Korea. Approximately 25% were victims of both GBV and IPV. Multivariate analyses revealed that GBV was the most critical factor for mental health outcomes. North Korean refugee women with only GBV or GBV and IPV had significantly higher depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation severity than those without violence victimization. Risk of suicide attempt was also significantly higher among those with only GBV (OR = 16.52, p =.015) or both GBV and IPV (OR = 9.96, p =.048) than those without any violence victimization.

22,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Dating abuse (DA) is prevalent and consequential, but no brief DA screening tools are available for use in pediatric or other settings. This study was designed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the MARSHA-C, which is a three-item DA victimization screening tool. Methods: The participants were 224 U.S. youth ages 11–21 years old (20% male, 77% female, 3% non-binary gender). Youth completed an online questionnaire about adolescent relationship abuse. The survey included the Measure of Adolescent Relationship Harassment and Abuse (MARSHA), which is a comprehensive DA measurement instrument normed on a nationally representative sample. Of 34 DA victimization items from the MARSHA, the three most prevalent items were hypothesized to have good predictive validity of the full scale score as a brief, screening version (MARSHA-C). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the MARSHA-C to identify victims of DA was calculated. Results: Using the MARSHA as the reference standard, the cutpoint of 1 on the MARSHA-C screening tool was identified as optimal. The MARSHA-C had a sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 91%, and positive predictive value of 91%. Thus, for youth who endorse ≥ 1 MARSHA-C items, there is a 91% probability that they have experienced DA in the past year. Exploratory analyses by demographic subgroups suggest that the predictive validity of the MARSHA-C is approximately equivalent for females and males, younger and older adolescents, Asian, Black, Latinx, Multiracial and White youth, and heterosexual and lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth. Conclusions: The MARSHA-C can be used to detect DA among 11–21-year-old youth via online surveys for research purposes, or in clinical care settings to facilitate proactive patient counseling or parent-oriented anticipatory guidance.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,BMC Pediatrics,14521,0,22,Validity of a three-item dating abuse victimization screening tool in a 11–21 year old sample,1,true,10.1186/s12887-022-03397-w,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Pediatrics,2022.0,29.0,0.0,,22,2943343,E.

23,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Postnatal Care (PNC) is one of the healthcare-packages in the continuum of care for mothers and children that needs to be in place to reduce global maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. We sought to identify the essential components of PNC and develop signal functions to reflect these which can be used for the monitoring and evaluation of availability and quality of PNC. Methods: Systematic review of the literature using MESH headings for databases (Cinahl, Cochrane, Global Health, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science). Papers and reports on content of PNC published from 2000–2020 were included. Narrative synthesis of data and development of signal function through 7 consensus-building workshops with 184 stakeholders. Results: Forty-Eight papers and reports are included in the systematic review from which 22 essential components of PNC were extracted and used to develop 14 signal functions. Signal functions are used in obstetrics to denote a list of interventions that address major causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity or mortality. For each signal function we identified the equipment, medication and consumables required for implementation. The prevention and management of infectious diseases (malaria, HIV, tuberculosis) are considered essential components of routine PNC depending on population disease burden or whether the population is considered at risk. Screening and management of pre-eclampsia, maternal anaemia and mental health are recommended universally. Promotion of and support of exclusive breastfeeding and uptake of a modern contraceptive method are also considered essential components of PNC. For the new-born baby, cord care, monitoring of growth and development, screening for congenital disease and commencing vaccinations are considered essential signal functions. Screening for gender-based violence (GBV) including intimate partner- violence (IPV) is recommended when counselling can be provided and/or a referral pathway is in place. Debriefing following birth (complicated or un-complicated) was agreed through consensus-building as an important component of PNC. Conclusions: Signal functions were developed which can be used for monitoring and evaluation of content and quality of PNC. Country adaptation and validation is recommended and further work is needed to examine if the proposed signal functions can serve as a useful monitoring and evaluation tool.

24,"© 2022, The Author(s).In December 2019, a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was identified in China. This virus spread quickly and in March, 2020, it was declared a pandemic. Scientists predicted the worst scenario to occur in Africa since it was the least developed of the continents in terms of human development index, lagged behind others in achievement of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs), has inadequate resources for provision of social services, and has many fragile states. In addition, there were relatively few research reporting findings on COVID-19 in Africa. On the contrary, the more developed countries reported higher disease incidences and mortality rates. However, for Africa, the earlier predictions and modelling into COVID-19 incidence and mortality did not fit into the reality.

25,"© The Author(s) 2022.The costs and consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) are well-documented; however, little is known about how experiences of violence are connected to specific economic insecurities including food, healthcare, and housing insecurity among both men and women. This study investigates (1) the prevalence of food, healthcare, and housing insecurity across gender and racial groups exposed to IPV and SV and (2) associations between exposure to past-year IPV and SV and past-year food, healthcare, and housing insecurity controlling for confounding factors. A cross-sectional survey design was used in this study. Data from 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) were analyzed in a nationally representative sample of men (N = 8079) and women (N = 9970). Logistic regressions were used to model associations between past-year intimate partner and sexual violence and dependent variables of food, healthcare, and housing insecurity. Analyses were stratified by gender and included control variables of age, income, education, and race/ethnicity. Higher rates of food, housing, and healthcare insecurity were found among men and women of color exposed to violence, particularly among respondents who identified as Black/African American, Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native, and other racial/ethnic minority groups. For men, IPV and SV was associated with higher odds for experiencing food (AOR = 2.40, p <.001), housing (AOR = 2.06, p <.001), and healthcare insecurity (AOR = 2.39, p <.001). For women, IPV and SV was also associated with higher odds for experiencing food (AOR = 2.16, p <.001), housing (AOR = 1.94, p <.001), and healthcare insecurity (AOR = 2.38, p <.001). Findings identify specific economic needs among survivors and suggest that the burdens of IPV and SV are not equitably shared across racial/ethnic populations.

26,"© 2022 The Authors. Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Nordic College of Caring Science.Background: Identifying young people exposed to sexual risk-taking or violence is fundamental, when seeking to strengthen their health. However, young people seldom share sexual health concerns or experiences of violence with healthcare professionals (HCPs). Studies evaluating how use of a risk assessment tool influences the dialogue about sexual health and violence are sparse. Aims: The aim of this study was to explore HCPs' experiences of using the SEXual health Identification Tool (SEXIT) in encounters with young people at Swedish youth clinics. Method: Three focus group interviews were conducted with 21 HCPs from nine youth clinics, where SEXIT had been introduced. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: Three themes were identified. The theme, Facilitates dialogue about sexuality and vulnerability, describes how the questionnaire pertaining to SEXIT helped to normalise and help both HCPs and young people to take part in the dialogue about sensitive issues. Need for a trustful encounter presents HCPs' ethical concerns regarding how the questionnaire affects the integrity of young people and trust-making. Sensitive topics entail challenges describes HCPs' challenges when dealing with sensitive issues. Additionally, it describes needs for knowledge and collaboration when targeting vulnerable young people. Conclusions: The HCPs stated that using SEXIT developed their ability to address sensitive issues and helped both them and young people to take part in the dialogue about sexuality and exposure to violence. SEXIT involves experiences of ethical concerns regarding integrity and trust-making. It also entails challenges in having dialogues about sensitive issues, how to deal with risk assessment outcomes and in improvements regarding inter-professional collaborations.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences,18828,1,36,Identifying sexual risk-taking and ill health in the meeting with young people-experiences of using an assessment tool,1,true,10.1111/scs.13081,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences,2022.0,30.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Using SEXIT developed HCPs' ability to address sensitive issues and helped both them and young people to take part in the dialogue about sexuality and exposure to violence.""}",26,38393701,H.

27,"© The Author(s) 2022.A growing body of research illustrates that sexual minority men (SMM) experience elevated rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) compared to heterosexual individuals. Researchers have examined the relationship between minority stress and IPV victimization among sexual minority men. A majority of the IPV research identifying risk factors associated with IPV victimization among SMM have sampled predominately non-Hispanic White SMM, while Latino SMM are consistently under-represented in IPV research. This study examines the associations between (1) co-occurring psychosocial factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, childhood sexual abuse, drug use, and problematic drinking) and (2) Latino-specific minority stress factors (e.g., U.S.-born, language, race/ethnic identities, and discrimination) on IPV victimization in a nationwide sample of Latino SMM. Data were collected from Latino SMM aged 18 or older, identified as cis-male, and in a romantic relationship with a cis-male partner (N = 530). The participants were recruited through social media and geo-location-based dating mobile applications. A majority (72%) of the sample reported IPV victimization in their lifetime. Specific to forms of IPV, more than half (51.9%) of the sample reported monitoring behaviors, while 49.6% reported emotional IPV, 45.1% reported physical IPV, 31.5% reported controlling behaviors, and 22.3% reported HIV-related IPV. In multivariable models, psychosocial and Latino-specific factors were associated with the increased likelihood of IPV victimization. Regarding Latino-specific factors, being born in the U.S. and race-based discrimination predicted IPV victimization. These findings highlight the extent to which minority stress elevates the risk of IPV for Latino SMM and point to the need to address social factors in IPV prevention services. Further, work on SMM IPV victimization tends to focus on the potential role of sexual orientation-related discrimination, whereas the current study points to the importance of race-based discrimination.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,0,37,Psychosocial and Culturally-Specific Factors Related to Intimate Partner Violence Victimization among a Sample of Latino Sexual Minority Cis Men in the U.S.,0,false,10.1177/08862605211072167,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2022.0,100.0,0.0,,27,13298776,Gabriel Robles,144545033,Stephen C.

28,"© The Author(s) 2022.Theories on the cause of mental and emotional distress contribute to illness course and treatment. The theorizing of women's experience “as problem” has been widely critiqued by feminist psychologists yet continues in clinical practice. This qualitative study reports on data collected in a psychiatric outpatient clinic in south/central Mexico on the culturally embedded causal theories of mental illness among Mexican patients, a family member or caregiver, and their psychiatrists. The author reports on the influence of gender expectations and the view of “women as problem” in Mexico. Specifically, stakeholders considered that the idea of “mujeres abnegadas” (self-sacrificing women) was the cause of illness in female patients diagnosed with depressive or anxiety-related disorders. In the face of gendered violence and abuse, Mexican women were expected to be silent and submissive, to suppress their thoughts and feelings, and to endure (“aguantar”) their experiences to conform to gender-based expectations, and psychiatrists expressed little hope of alleviating women's suffering.

29,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Research on traditional gender beliefs has highlighted their psychological impact and social implications for women. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to adapt and validate the Spanish version of the Multicultural O’Kelly Women’s Beliefs Scale. Next, we explored its sources of validity evidence in relation to intimate partner violence, stress, and depression. Based on the Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy framework, traditional gender beliefs were expected to be associated with higher levels of intimate partner violence, stress and depression. We also expected to obtain a psychometrically-sound factor structure of the Multicultural O’Kelly Women’s Beliefs Scale. Methods: A sample of Spanish women (N = 322) completed the Multicultural O’Kelly Women’s Beliefs Scale, the Beck’s Depression Inventory II, the Modified Conflict Tactics Scale, and the Stress Perceived Scale. To test the psychometric properties of the Multicultural O’Kelly Women’s Beliefs Scale we implemented exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and an analysis of the area under the curve. Results: Regarding the psychometric properties of the scale, statistical analysis revealed a one-factor dimensionality (Global traditionalism) and supported a reduction of items in the original instrument. The abbreviated version (eight items) obtained the best fit indices. Considering the association between traditional gender beliefs and psychological outcomes, we found that traditional gender beliefs were associated with increased severity of stress, depressive symptoms and reciprocal verbal aggression. Conclusion: The Spanish adaptation of the Multicultural O’Kelly Women’s Beliefs Scale provided a very short, psychometrically robust and clinically relevant measure of traditional gender beliefs. In addition to the association between traditional gender beliefs and mental health outcomes, an important finding was the relationship between traditional gender beliefs and intimate partner violence. Our scale might be used in clinical settings by helping women to identify their traditional gender beliefs and replace them by healthy and goal-oriented beliefs, which would also contribute in achieving a more egalitarian society.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,BMC Women's Health,19499,1,22,"The role of women's traditional gender beliefs in depression, intimate partner violence and stress: insights from a Spanish abbreviated multicultural measure",1,true,10.1186/s12905-021-01572-2,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Women's Health,2021.0,128.0,0.0,,29,38568638,Montse Rovira,104672708,L.

30,"© 2022 Society for Public Health Education.Intimate partner violence (IPV) is as prevalent or more so as reported by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals compared with non-LGBTQ individuals. Yet largely due to prior harmful and nonaffirming experiences with service providers, they are reluctant to seek services from domestic violence service providers (DVSP). These factors, combined with the reality that those who do seek services may not be provided with safe, affirming, and effective responses, exacerbate the impact of IPV on LGBTQ health and recovery. The North Carolina (NC) LGBTQ Domestic Violence Response Initiative (NC Initiative) was developed to increase DVSP capacity to serve LGBTQ survivors. This article describes the first four phases of the Initiative’s development: (1) formative focus group research with DVSPs statewide, identifying agencies’ interest in improving their responses to LGBTQ survivors; (2) Initiative launch, including funding and identification of partners; (3) development of capacity assessment tools; and (4) review of baseline capacity assessment findings. The development of tools, specifically designed to assess capacity of DVSPs to serve LGBTQ survivors, is a unique contribution as no tools existed to do so. The common capacity-building needs and data-informed recommendations identified provide a starting point for agencies expanding into LGBTQ-focused work, who may not have the benefit of grant funding, tools, or evaluators to assist. Our findings, lessons learned, and tools may be used by agencies to evaluate and inform their own practices, thereby creating safer, more affirming agencies that are capable provide effective care to meet unique needs of LGBTQ survivors.",2022-12-01,Journal,Article,Health Education and Behavior,20877,0,49,"North Carolina LGBTQ Domestic Violence Response Initiative: Building Capacity to Provide Safe, Affirming Services",0,false,10.1177/10901981211067167,SAGE Publications Inc.,Health Education & Behavior,2022.0,12.0,0.0,,30,118383727,Stacy M.

31,"© The Author(s) 2021.Although many studies have concluded that men and women engage in domestic violence at equal levels, existing studies have hardly focused on gender specific risk factors for domestic violence perpetration. Therefore, this study aimed to examine gender differences in criminogenic risk factors between Dutch male and female forensic outpatients who were referred to forensic treatment for domestic violence. Clinical structured assessments of criminogenic risk factors were retrieved for 366 male and 87 female outpatients. Gender differences were not only found in the prevalence and interrelatedness of criminogenic risk factors, but also in associations between criminogenic risk factors and treatment dropout. In men, risk factors related to the criminal history, substance abuse, and criminal attitudes were more prevalent than in women, whereas risk factors related to education/work, finances, and the living environment were more prevalent in women. Further, having criminal friends, having a criminal history, and drug abuse were associated with treatment dropout in men, whereas a problematic relationship with family members, housing instability, a lack of personal support, and unemployment were associated with treatment dropout in women. Finally, network analyses revealed gender differences in risk factor interrelatedness.

While this strategy has become increasingly popular, there is no standardized approach for assessing and constructing these norm proxies, and no review of these approaches has been undertaken to date. This study presents the results of a systematic review of methods used to construct quantitative proxy measures for social norms related to IPV.

Inclusion criteria comprised studies published since 2000 in English that either (i) examined a norm proxy related to gender or IPV or (ii) analyzed the relationship between a norm proxy and perpetration of, experiences of, or attitudes toward IPV. Studies that employed qualitative methods or that elicited direct measures of descriptive or injunctive norms were not included. Twenty-six studies were eligible for review.

This review was conducted by searching peer-reviewed articles published between 01 June 2000 and 31 May 2022 using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database, and Web of Science. A comprehensive search was conducted using the terms: “Autism” OR “ASD” AND “Sexuality” OR “Romantic relation” OR “sexual behavior” AND/OR “sexual awareness”. After an accurate revision of 214 full manuscripts, 11 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review found that, although individuals with ASD may have sexual functioning, their sexuality is characterized by higher prevalence rates of gender dysphoria and inappropriate sexual behavior. Furthermore, sexual awareness is reduced in this patient population, and the prevalence of other variants of sexual orientation (i.e., homosexuality, asexuality, bisexuality, etc.) is higher in adolescents with ASD than in non-autistic peers. Sexual health and education should be included in the care path of patients with ASD in order to improve their quality of life and avoid/reduce inappropriate and risky behaviors.",2022-11-01,Journal,Review,Brain Sciences,21100367158,0,12,Sex and Sexuality in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Scoping Review on a Neglected but Fundamental Issue,1,true,10.3390/brainsci12111427,MDPI,Brain Science,2022.0,109.0,0.0,,38,30417415,M.

In Fall 2019, we sent a mail-in survey assessing relationship healthcare needs to N = 299 Veterans randomly sampled from 20 northeastern VA primary care clinics (oversampling female and younger Veterans). We compared those reporting past year use or experience of physical/sexual aggression, threats/coercion, or injury (Severe IPV; 21%), to those only reporting yelling and screaming (Verbal Conflict; 51%), and denying any IPV (No IPV; 28%). Participants across groups desired 2–6 sessions of face-to-face support for couples’ health and communication. No IPV participants were older and had preferred treatment in primary care. The Verbal Conflict and Severe IPV groups were both flagged by IPV screens and had similar interest in couple treatment and relationship evaluation. The Severe IPV group had higher rates of harms (e.g., depression, alcohol use disorder, relationship dissatisfaction, fear of partner) and higher interest in addressing safety outside of VA.

The questionnaires used were that of Spain’s Ombudsman (Defensor del Pueblo) to detect the risk of becoming a victim of bullying and an adaptation of Spain’s CECAD to assess the risk of emotional problems. The participants were 1077 gender-matched subjects enrolled in the 6th year of Primary Education (n = 467) and the 1st year of Lower Secondary Education (n = 610) from 19 schools in the Region of Extremadura. High reliability was obtained in both questionnaires, as well as a significant relationship between bullying and emotional problems (0.36). The scales place the pupils at either a certain risk level (mild, moderate, or severe) or no risk. The study concludes with the description of four situations deriving from the cross relationship between victimization and the pupil’s emotional problems: (1) no risk of bullying and no risk of emotional problems (73.2%), (2) risk of bullying but no risk of emotional problems (11.1%), (3) no risk of bullying but risk of emotional problems (9.4%), and (4) risk of bullying and risk of emotional problems (6.3%).",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,Bullying and Emotional Problems in Pupils from 11 to 13 Years Old: Joint Detection through Self-Report,1,true,10.3390/ijerph192114306,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,67.0,0.0,,40,2121584794,A.

Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study (n = 561) was conducted with reported data on sexual violence against adolescents in the state of Espírito Santo registered in SINAN between 2011 and 2018 to understand the prevalence and predictors of sexual violence against adolescent victims, as well as to describe the perpetrators and the nature of the aggression. Variables to characterize the victim, aggression, and perpetrator were used. Bivariate analyses were performed using chi-square (χ2) and Fisher’s exact tests, and multivariate analyses were conducted using log-binomial models; the results were presented with prevalence ratios. All analyses were stratified by sex. Results: The prevalence of sexual violence was 32.6%, and 93% of the victims were female. In both males and females, the reported sexual violence was associated with a younger age (10–12 years old), living at home, being related to the perpetrator, and a history of sexual violence. In females, the reported sexual violence was also associated with the number of perpetrators, and in males, with the perpetrator’s age. Conclusions: Our findings show the high frequency of reporting of sexual violence and the characteristics of the victim, the aggression, and the aggressor as factors associated with its occurrence in both sexes.

Journal of the International AIDS Society published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the International AIDS Society.Introduction: In 2021, the number of people affected by displacement worldwide reached the highest on record, with an estimated 30.5 million refugees and 4.6 million asylum seekers seeking safety across international borders and further 53.2 million people displaced within their countries of origin. Most forcibly displaced persons come from or relocate to lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and many of those countries have large HIV epidemics. In this commentary, we describe some of the challenges at the intersection of HIV and displacement vulnerabilities that cannot be easily addressed in resource-limited environments. Discussion: HIV transmission and prevention and treatment efforts in the context of displacement are affected by myriad behavioural, social and structural factors across different stages of the displacement journey. For example, structural barriers faced by people experiencing displacement in relation to HIV prevention and care include funding constraints and legal framework deficiencies. Such barriers prevent all forced migrants, and particularly those whose sexual identities or practices are stigmatized against, access to prevention and care equal to local residents. Xenophobia, racism and other social factors, as well as individual risky behaviours facilitated by experiences of forced migration, also affect the progress towards 90-90-90 targets in displaced populations. Current evidence suggests increased HIV vulnerability in the period before displacement due to the effect of displacement drivers on medical supplies and infrastructure. During and after displacement, substantial barriers to HIV testing exist, though following resettlement in stable displacement context, HIV incidence and viral suppression are reported to be similar to those of local populations. Conclusions: Experiences of often-marginalized displaced populations are diverse and depend on the context of displacement, countries of origin and resettlement, and the nature of the crises that forced these populations to move. To address current gaps in responses to HIV in displacement contexts, research in LMIC, particularly in less stable resettlement settings, needs to be scaled up. Furthermore, displaced populations need to be specifically addressed in national AIDS strategies and HIV surveillance systems. Finally, innovative technologies, such as point-of-care viral load and CD4 testing, need to be developed and introduced in settings facing displacement.",2022-11-01,Journal,Note,Journal of the International AIDS Society,19700175037,0,25,Left behind on the path to 90-90-90: understanding and responding to HIV among displaced people,1,true,10.1002/jia2.26031,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Journal of the International AIDS Society,2022.0,88.0,0.0,,42,11490165,T.

43,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis paper studies whether the toughening of the laws to regulate violence against women can adversely generate a retaliation effect that temporary increases female homicides. Using a panel of 2167 solved female homicides in Ecuador from 2010 to 2020, I first analyze the characteristics and trends of female gender-violence victims and I compare them with the evolution of other-violence victims. Second, I analyze the effects of a reform of the penal code introduced in 2014 that modified the consideration of gender violence and increased the penalty for femicides. I exploit the fact that women empowerment and the enforcement of the law was not homogeneous across municipalities to test whether these policies were associated with a backlash effect that temporarily increased female homicide rates. My analysis finds an increment in the gender-violence rates in municipalities that enforced the introduction of the new femicide penalty type, and in municipalities exhibiting an increased level of women empowerment. Specifically, I obtain that in municipalities that introduced the new femicide type and with an increased level of women empowerment, there was an increase of gender-violence rates of 1.49 points, relative to those that experienced gender-violence but not enforced the new femicide type. These results suggest evidence for an early formation of the retaliation effect hypothesis that consider that gender equality policies and legislation reforms to toughening the penalties for femicides can generate (at least temporarily) an increase of gender violence.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Women's Studies International Forum,24359,0,95,"Female homicides, laws, and women's empowerment: An early warning of retaliation effect",0,false,10.1016/j.wsif.2022.102650,Elsevier Ltd,Women's Studies: International Forum,2022.0,41.0,0.0,,43,2089514751,B.

44,"© 2022 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.Attributes and behavioral patterns of female homicide offenders have been less explored than those of males, particularly in crimes that involve aggravating factors such as dismemberment and mutilation. This study explored the patterns of female murderers who engage in postmortem dismemberment and/or mutilation of victims, contrasting these with the patterns of males who display these same behaviors. Cases were obtained from Radford-Florida Gulf Coast University Database and public sources, and then analyzed for specific characteristics of the crimes. An informational form was used to derive quantitative parameters. Statistical significance between sex and variables such as motive, dismemberment/mutilation style, and level of organization during the crime were examined. The majority of the cases were consistent with a defensive style. However, 23% of the cases involving females followed an offensive style compared to 33% among males. The nature of prior relationships between offenders and their victims was noteworthy, with the victims of males being largely strangers and the victims of females being primarily known to them. In comparison to males, females were markedly organized. These differences may emphasize aspects of psychological drives and pleasure-seeking that was more commonly seen among men, who often targeted strangers and were motivated by sadism in 25% of the cases. Dismemberment perpetrated by women primarily followed a defensive style that aimed to dispose of evidence, which would be congruent with the assumption that the murder occurred within a prior background of interpersonal partner violence toward the female perpetrator or other family members.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Forensic Sciences,27769,0,67,Female murderers who mutilate or dismember their victims: An exploration of patterns and sex differences,0,false,10.1111/1556-4029.15136,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Journal of Forensic Sciences,2022.0,49.0,0.0,,44,1490738542,Victor G.

45,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Introduction: Disparities in gun violence across race are well documented. Studying these disparities is essential to reduce preventable gun deaths. This study evaluates the relationship between sociodemographic factors and firearms used in gun deaths. Materials and methods: This retrospective cohort study of firearm mortalities from 2009 to 2018 used the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death Public Use Record from the National Center for Health Statistics. The primary outcome was the type of firearm used and the secondary outcome was autopsy status. Factors of interest include race, ethnicity, gender, marital status, age, education, and place of death. Factors significantly associated with outcomes in univariate analyses were included in separate multivariate logistic regression models for assaults, intentional self-harm, and accidents. Results: A total of 276,127 firearm deaths from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed. Compared to White victims, Black victims were less likely to die from handguns (accident: odds ratio [OR] = 0.70, P < 0.05; self-harm: OR = 0.84, P < 0.001; assault: OR = 0.58, P < 0.001) and rifles, shotguns, or large firearms (accident: OR = 0.30, P < 0.001; self-harm: OR = 0.37, P < 0.001; assault: OR = 0.28, P < 0.001). Black decedents were more likely to undergo autopsy than White decedents (accident: OR = 2.14, P < 0.001; intentional self-harm: OR = 2.02, P < 0.001; assault: OR = 2.02, P < 0.001). Ethnicity, gender, marital status, age, education, and other racial identities were also associated with firearms used and autopsy rates (P < 0.05).

This article reports on a qualitative study that explored women's experiences of compulsory mental health treatment in Australia. In-depth interviews revealed substantial gendered harms experienced by women within involuntary mental health treatment settings. Themes identified were: involuntary treatment replicates the dynamics and tactics of gendered violence; treatment involves profound deprivation and losses, with potential implications across the lifecourse; mental health services disrupt and undermine mothering; and recovery is found outside of coercive mental health systems. The study reveals the heightened harms experienced by women within involuntary mental health contexts, as well as women's strategic resistances to psychiatric oppression. It demonstrates the relevance of a conceptual lens that is attuned to gender, in order to develop a deeper understanding of women's experiences of intersecting oppressions within involuntary mental health settings.

49,"© The Author(s) 2021.Urbanization in low and middle-income nations is characterized by economic and demographic shifts largely understood to be beneficial to women’s empowerment. These changes include increased education and wage-labor opportunities, a disruption of traditional patrilocal residence systems, and reductions in spousal age gap and fertility. However, such changes may drive a “violence backlash,” with men increasing intimate partner violence (IPV) in efforts to challenge women’s shifting status. To date, tests of this idea primarily relate to women’s changing economic status, with less known about the demographic correlates of IPV in urbanizing settings. Addressing this, we conducted a cross-sectional study of IPV behavior and attitudes in an urbanizing community in Mwanza, northern Tanzania (n = 317). Consistent with a violence backlash, IPV was reported more often among women educated at higher levels than their husband, and women earning similar, rather than lower, wages to their husband were more likely to report that he condones IPV. These findings were independent of women’s absolute education and income. Furthermore, less frequent paternal kin contact, and relatively small spousal age gaps, generally understood to boost women’s empowerment, were associated with an increased risk of experiencing IPV. Less frequent paternal kin contact was also associated with an increased likelihood that a husband condones IPV. Contrary to our predictions, relatively lower fertility, generally linked to higher women’s empowerment, did not predict IPV behavior and women with high, rather than low, fertility were more likely to report that their husband condones IPV. Overall, our results support the notion of a violence backlash corresponding to economic changes for women that accompany urbanization. In contrast, demographic changes associated with urbanization have more variable relationships. Drawing on these results, we suggest future research avenues for better understanding the vulnerability of women to IPV in urbanizing settings.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,1,37,"Positive Correlation Between Women’s Status and Intimate Partner Violence Suggests Violence Backlash in Mwanza, Tanzania",0,false,10.1177/08862605211050095,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2021.0,83.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results support the notion of a violence backlash corresponding to economic changes for women that accompany urbanization, and suggest future research avenues for better understanding the vulnerability of women to IPV in urbanizing settings.'}",49,2072426216,Joseph A Kilgallen,8320244,S.

50,"© The Author(s) 2021.Hate speech is often discussed and investigated as an online phenomenon, while hate speech among adolescents in the real world (e.g., in schools) has rarely been researched. Consequently, not much is known about potential interpersonal correlates and theoretical frameworks that might help us better understand why adolescents engage in hate speech in offline environments. To add to the literature, this study investigates hate speech perpetration among young people by utilizing the Social Cognitive Theory; more specifically, the association between witnessing and perpetrating hate speech in schools, and whether this relation is weakened or strengthened by anti-hate speech injunctive norms and deviant peer pressure. The sample consists of 1719 young people (45.1% boys, 53.6% girls, 1.3% gender diverse) between 11 and 18 years old (Mage = 13.96; SD =.98) from 22 schools in Switzerland. Self-report questionnaires were administered to measure hate speech involvement and adolescents’ perception of social norms (i.e., anti-hate speech injunctive norms and deviant peer pressure). Multilevel regression analyses revealed that witnessing and perpetrating hate speech were positively associated. Moreover, injunctive anti-hate speech norms were negatively related and deviant peer pressure positively related to hate speech perpetration. Finally, increasing levels of injunctive anti-hate speech norms weakened the relation between witnessing and perpetrating hate speech, whereas higher levels of deviant peer pressure strengthened this association. The findings demonstrate that the Social Cognitive Theory is a useful framework for understanding hate speech perpetration in schools. The results also highlight the importance of taking into account social norms and interpersonal relationships (e.g., within the class) when designing anti-hate speech prevention programs and not focusing solely on intrapersonal factors.",2022-11-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,2,37,Playing by the Rules?

51,"© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the relationship between gender and violent offending is mediated, in part, by an interest in participating in physically dangerous activities. Design/methodology/approach: This study makes use of self-report data from a sample of college students and other adults that they recruited to participate in this study to test the hypothesis that having an interest in physically dangerous activities mediates, at least in part, the gender–violence association. Two measures of violent offending are examined: total violent offending and the number of different types of violence committed. Relevant control variables are included in multivariate models, and bootstrapping mediation analysis is also conducted. Findings: Net of the effects of controls, an index for interest in physically dangerous activities, significantly predicts both total violence and the number of types of violence committed. Bootstrapping-based mediation analysis produces support for the hypothesis that males have higher rates of interpersonal violence than females, in part, because of a greater desire to engage in physically dangerous activities. Originality/value: This study is an important step in understanding why males are more likely to engage in interpersonal violence than females.",2022-10-18,Journal,Article,Journal of Criminal Psychology,21100370349,0,12,Interest in physical danger: does it mediate the relationship between gender and violent offending?,0,false,10.1108/JCP-01-2022-0003,Emerald Publishing,Journal of Criminal Psychology,2022.0,51.0,0.0,,51,4505440,A.

52,"Copyright © 2022 Hing, O’Mullan, Mainey, Greer and Breen.This paper presents an integrative review of research on domestic and family violence (DFV), including intimate partner violence (IPV), experienced by victims and perpetrators with a gambling problem. It aims to review, critique, and synthesize research on this topic to generate fresh and alternative perspectives to guide future research. Based on a systematic search of the academic literature and a targeted search of gray literature, the paper summarizes findings from empirical studies pertaining to the prevalence of perpetration and victimization, characteristics of perpetrators and victims, and explanations for this violence. Based on this review, the paper suggests several potential improvements that can be considered in future studies. These include a shift from focusing on situational violence to also include coercive control; greater sensitivity in research design and interpretation to gender differences in experiences of violence; and the need to include economic abuse as a form of DFV/IPV. Adopting a public health lens is also recommended to broaden the research focus from victims and perpetrators to also consider contextual factors. In particular, gambling research should examine the contribution of gambling products, practices, environments, and marketing to DFV/IPV and how this might be ameliorated. While research to date has drawn much needed attention to the risks that gambling presents for DFV/IPV, this review provides some suggestions for future research so that it can provide more nuanced findings to inform policy and practice.",2022-10-13,Journal,Review,Frontiers in Psychology,21100216571,0,13,An integrative review of research on gambling and domestic and family violence: Fresh perspectives to guide future research,1,true,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.987379,Frontiers Media S.A.,Frontiers in Psychology,2022.0,145.0,0.0,,52,145385270,N.

Thus, this study aims to probe first whether women owners of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in export markets experience IPVAW. Secondly, it aims to explore the effect of IPVAW on their relationship quality with business partners, mediated by the performance of export capabilities. Using a structured questionnaire applied through personal interviews, we surveyed 57 female owners of exporting MSEs in Peru. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data and test the model. The preliminary findings indicate that women exporters who experience IPVAW are more likely to face problems performing export capabilities. In turn, these performance problems seem to affect the quality of their relationships with importers and suppliers. Moreover, there is a direct relationship between IPVAW and problems in performing export capabilities and between issues performing capabilities and the relationship quality. Our theoretical contribution is a conceptual model that proposes the variable “Problems Performing Capabilities” as a mediator to measure the effects of IPVAW on exporting MSEs owned by women. Our findings urge policymakers and trade organizations boosting women-owned export enterprises to include initiatives that address and prevent IPVAW in their export promotion programs.",2022-10-04,Journal,Article,Frontiers in Psychology,21100216571,0,13,Effects of intimate partner violence against women in international micro and small enterprises relationships: The mediator role of capabilities,1,true,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.950807,Frontiers Media S.A.,Frontiers in Psychology,2022.0,92.0,0.0,,53,2186838798,Jazmín E.

54,"© The Author(s) 2022.The study aimed to examine variables that could contribute to the awareness of online gendered violence (OGV). For this, an online survey was used. First, we assessed whether sexism and violence justification affect awareness of gender-based cyberviolence. Second, this effect was evaluated considering the smartphone usage. Third, we studied differences in awareness of OGV according to gender, digital generation, and academic field of study. Fourth, we tested for multiple associations of attitudinal variables, smartphone usage, and sociodemographic variables with OGV. The study involved 453 young adults from the Andalucia region, Spain (Mage = 21.9, SD = 2.15; 64% women). The results showed that, with more sexist attitudes and normalization of violence, the limits regarding what constitute gender-based violence in digital media are more permissive (less awareness). Regarding smartphone use, when it became problematic, desensitization to cyberviolence against women and sexual and gender minorities increased. Multiple correspondence analysis revealed an observer profile, that is, a woman studying for a humanistic or healthcare career who does not believe in psychosocial sex differences, or that violence as a reaction is justified, and also does not support biological fatalism of sexism and violence. This observer also has high awareness of the cyber-behaviors that constitute OGV.

Among the different types of emergency situations, our study focuses on violence against women (VAW). In keeping with current efforts in the scientific literature on bystander intervention and the evidence currently available, the main focus of this study is to analyze some personal factors that reflect the characteristics or experiences of bystanders and that could have a bearing on their predisposition to help victims of VAW (i.e., empathy, a just world belief system, and expectations of self-efficacy) and later analyze the possible relationship between these personal characteristics and gender or previous experience as a VAW bystander. An opportunity sample of 546 Spanish participants (73.4% women and 26.6% men) between 18 and 56 years of age took part in this study and fill out a sociodemographic data sheet, a questionnaire to evaluate the experience as violence witness designed ad hoc, and the Characteristics of People who Help Questionnaire scale (CPHQ). The results obtained indicate that CPHQ could constitute an adequate measure for the three dimensions analyzed. Female participants are significantly more empathetic than males, but in the case of a just world belief and expectations of self-efficacy the results showed no gender-related differences. Additionally, only a just world belief was clearly influenced by having been a bystander to some form of VAW. In conclusion, this study contributes a proposal for an evaluating instrument featuring three relevant personal characteristics in the development of helping behaviors, presenting some results of interest regarding empathy, a just world belief, and expectations of self-efficacy and their relationship with gender or previous experiences as VAW bystanders.

We examined these factors using a cross-cultural comparison between young adults in Uganda and the United States. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to young adults aged 18 to 25 in Uganda (n = 300) and the U.S. (n = 300). Survey questions assessed demographics, attitudes toward IPV, IPV victimization and perpetration, gender discrepancy, discrepancy stress, and alcohol use. We conducted chi-square tests, as well as bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, separately for participants in each country. Results: The prevalence of IPV perpetration differed significantly by country for men (58.06% in the U.S. vs. 42.73% in Uganda; p = 0.03) and women (40.00% in the U.S. vs. 14.00% in Uganda; p < 0.01). IPV victimization differed by country for men (67.74% in the U.S. vs. 51.82% in Uganda; p = 0.02) but not for women. Gender discrepancy and discrepancy stress also varied by country and by sex and were higher in the U.S. for both men and women. IPV victimization was a common risk factor for adults in both Uganda (Adj. OR = 23.47; 95% CI: 7.79, 70.22) and the U.S. (Adj. OR = 27.40; 95% CI: 9.97, 75.32). In Uganda, male sex was significantly associated with IPV perpetration in multivariable analyses (Adj. OR = 6.23; 95% CI: 2.45, 15.86), and so were IPV attitudes (Adj. OR = 2.22; 1.20, 4.10). In the U.S., a likely alcohol use disorder (AUD) was also significantly associated with IPV perpetration (Adj. OR = 7.11; 95% CI: 2.25, 22.54). Conclusions: Permissive IPV attitudes were associated with IPV perpetration among Ugandan participants, while likely AUD was associated with perpetration in U.S. participants. Overall, IPV perpetration was significantly higher for U.S. males compared with Ugandan males.

However, the role of new masculinities in overcoming violence from an intercultural perspective has not been dealt with in depth. This article presents the current state of the art on studies of new masculinities, aiming to clarify which models of masculinity offer interethnic possibilities for overcoming violence. Thus, a review of the scientific literature in international reference databases has been carried out. First, the dichotomy between the hegemonic model of masculinities that perpetuates violence and inequality, but is socially attractive, versus models of masculinity that have achieved great changes in terms of overcoming inequality, but without attractiveness, is presented. In the second section, we describe how the new model of alternative masculinity combines ethics and desire, thus overcoming the double standard between the two. This represents possibilities for men who want to contribute to overcoming gender violence by participating in more egalitarian relationships that unite ethics and passion. Interethnic studies are presented that are based on this new model of alternative masculinity and that also breaks with white hegemony, thus breaking down racist prejudices and offering even more possibilities from this cultural diversity.",2022-10-01,Journal,Article,Masculinities and Social Change,21100444326,0,11,The New Intercultural Alternative Masculinities for the Overcoming of Violence Las Nuevas Masculinidades Alternativas Interculturales en la Superación de la Violencia,,,10.17583/mcs.10268,Hipatia Editorial,,,,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It discovers and contrasts the frequently co-occurring reasons due to which husbands’ behaviour of beating their wives is believed to be legitimate by both partners in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Though the discovered frequently co-occurring reasons, such as “arguing with the husband and neglecting the children” altogether, are similar in both genders but the fraction of wives believing in such reasons are significantly greater than that of husbands. This psychological disparity across genders could help in identifying the social and cultural factors to whom this disparity is attributed.

The study objectives are to provide an exploratory overview of the occurrence of SV in AIPs in Belgium and their help-seeking behavior (HSB). This overview is crucial to develop prevention strategies and care paths focusing on providing adequate care to AIP SV victims in Belgium. Methods: Quantitative data from structured interviews with AIPs (n = 62) triangulated with qualitative data from in-depth interviews with AIP SV victims (n = 11) served to explore the nature and impact of SV in AIPs in Belgium and their HSB. Results: A total of 83.9% of respondents have experienced SV. A total of 61.3% were victimized within the past year. Victimization seems more gender-balanced than in the general population. AIPs link SV to their legal status and their associated vulnerable situation. HSB upon SV was very limited in this sample. Help-seeking barriers interfering with the decision-making process to consult (in)formal resources were identified. Conclusions: AIPs in Belgium are at high risk of SV.

High levels of gender inequality and interpersonal violence may contribute to higher levels of physical abuse. Using an ecological perspective, this study examines the association of country-level gender inequality and household-level parental physical abuse, and the moderating role of child gender in this association in low- and middle-income countries. We used data on over 420,000 households from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and country-level indicators from the United Nations Development Program Human Development data. We employed multilevel logistic regression to examine the association between gender inequality with the log-odds of physical abuse after accounting for country- and individual-level covariates. In order to more fully explore our results, we calculated predicted probabilities of abuse for several scenarios. The results indicated that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher probabilities of physical abuse. This association was stronger for female children than for male children. The probabilities of abuse by child gender were indistinguishable, although rates of physical abuse converged as gender inequality increased, at a statistically marginal level.

In the context of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), a leading risk factor is gender disparity. Addressing gender disparity, by involving fathers, mothers in law and other family members can significantly improve perinatal and maternal healthcare, including risk factors for poor perinatal mental health such as domestic violence and poor social support. This highlights the need to develop and implement gender-transformative (GT) interventions that seek to engage with men and reduce or overcome gender-based constraints. This scoping review aimed to highlight existing gender transformative interventions from LMIC that specifically aimed to address perinatal mental health (partner violence, anxiety or depression and partner support) and identify components of the intervention that were found to be useful and acceptable.

Six papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review (four from Africa and two from Asia).

63,"© 2022 World Health Organization; licensed by IAS.Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) is guided by its global programme of work and the goal that a billion more people have universal health coverage (UHC). To achieve UHC, access for those most vulnerable must be guaranteed and prioritized. WHO is committed to developing evidence-based guidance to work towards UHC for trans and gender diverse (TGD) people. This commentary describes WHO's work related to TGD people over the last decade. Discussion: In 2011, WHO developed guidelines for the prevention and treatment of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men who have sex with men and TGD people. In 2013, the “HIV civil society reference group” called on WHO to provide specific guidance for TGD people. Values and preferences of TGD people were considered by WHO for the first time, which informed the development of the 2014 WHO Consolidated Guidelines on HIV Prevention, Diagnosis, Treatment and Care for Key Populations. The 2014 Guidelines included a comprehensive package of HIV-related health and enabling interventions with specific considerations for TGD people, as well as a specific policy brief in 2015. Regional WHO offices developed and/or supported the development of blueprints on transgender health and HIV in 2014 and 2016. A 2015 WHO report on sexual health, human rights and the law elucidated the harmful impacts of discriminatory laws on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, the 11th edition of the international classification of diseases saw the removal of “transsexualism” as a mental and behavioural disorder. WHO's first guideline on self-care interventions, updated in 2021, included key considerations concerning TGD people. In 2022, WHO's updated key populations guidelines include a prioritized package of not just HIV, but also viral hepatitis and STI health interventions for TGD people. Still, a broader and more specific health approach and a greater focus on social issues are needed to better serve the health needs of TGD people. Conclusions: WHO's understanding and commitment to TGD people's health has evolved and improved over the past decade. Together with professional and community trans health organizations, WHO should now start developing evidence-informed global guidance on TGD health as part of its remit to support UHC to all.",2022-10-01,Journal,Note,Journal of the International AIDS Society,19700175037,1,25,The World Health Organization's work and recommendations for improving the health of trans and gender diverse people,1,true,10.1002/jia2.26004,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Journal of the International AIDS Society,2022.0,16.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""WHO's work related to TGD people over the last decade is described and evidence‐based guidance to work towards UHC for trans and gender diverse (TGD) people is developed.""}",63,139081336,Virginia Macdonald,34431748,A.

65,"© 2021 SAGE Publications.The link between individual experiences in early childhood or adolescence years and future dating violence (DV) perpetration has been well established and explored across various populations. However, little is known on a worldwide scale, about the association between national conditions during childhood, like overall well-being or status of women in that nation, and perpetration of DV in emerging adulthood. Applying life-course theory and a socioecological framework to data from the International Dating Violence Study and country index scores, this study examines whether the overall well-being of a country during childhood affects the perpetration of DV in emerging adulthood. We also examine if the national status of women during childhood moderates the association between overall well-being of a country during childhood and DV perpetration in emerging adulthood, all while controlling for the individual effects of gender, violence approval, criminal history, neglect history, and anger management. The study’s sample size included 4,280 people from 19 countries. Men reported less likelihood of perpetrating DV compared to women. Cross national comparative analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between country well-being and women status on DV perpetration (β = 0.69, p <.05) at the national level. When women’s status was low or moderate, the well-being status showed an inverse effect on the probability of DV perpetration, but this direction switched in the face of high women’s status. Contrary to previous research, higher women status may contribute to increased intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration. Our findings underscore the existence of context-specific social conditions in relationship to IPV. Broad implications of the findings, potential explanations and directions for future research are discussed.",2022-10-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,1,37,Examining the Role of National Context: Do Country Conditions During Childhood Impact Perpetration of Dating Violence in Emerging Adulthood?,0,false,10.1177/08862605211043575,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2021.0,96.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Cross national comparative analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between country well-being and women status on DV perpetration at the national level, and contrary to previous research, higher women status may contribute to increased intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration.'}",65,65957225,Maxine Davis,24354636,Bernadette Ombayo,35335708,O.

66,"© 2022 International Society for Sexual MedicineIntroduction: Sexual violence (SV) has been a prevalent issue on college campuses for decades. Researchers, universities, and legislators have tried to understand and prevent it. Despite these efforts, 25% of female and 6% of male undergraduate students will experience a nonconsensual sexual experience (NSE) as a student. An immense amount of research has been conducted on the prevalence, effects, resources for, and outcomes of SV over the last few decades. Objectives: The current paper aims to compile and summarize the extant literature on undergraduate student disclosures of sexual violence. The objective is to provide a comprehensive review of the research. Methods: A literature search was performed using the terms sexual violence, NSE, undergraduate students, informal and formal reporting, and disclosure. Results: Disclosure patterns and outcomes for survivors vary widely based on individual factors including type of disclosure source (ie, informal or formal reporting), disclosure recipient response, previous history of NSEs, and personal identity (ie, gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity). Though there are many formal resources (ie, police, Title IX), the majority of survivors report to informal sources (ie, family or friends). In addition to researching survivors’ experiences and rates of disclosures, research also evaluates how disclosure recipients perceive their response to a survivor's disclosure, their likelihood of receiving a disclosure based on their own individual identities, and how the disclosure impacts the recipient and their relationship with the survivor. Conclusion: The individualized response and decision to report SV has made prevention and the creation of effective resources difficult. As there are so many individual factors to consider when evaluating how or whether a NSE will be disclosed, future research should consider these individual differences and use them to create more effective reporting sources and resources.

67,"© 2022 by The Author(s).This article problematizes claims of women’s empowerment in “masculine” sports through an exploration of women’s participation in mixed martial arts (MMA)—a combat sport colloquially referred to as “cage fighting.” MMA, perhaps more than any other sport, allows women athletes to challenge patriarchal beliefs about gender by demonstrating women’s capacity for physical violence and domination. But whereas investigations into MMA have produced important findings for studies of men and masculinities, there has been surprisingly little attention paid to women’s participation in this hypermasculine world. This article begins to fill this gap through an ethnographic account of this growing sport. Drawing from more than four years of ethnographic fieldwork and 40 semi-structured interviews with professional women’s MMA athletes, I show how the neoliberal–postfeminist culture of MMA undermines its empowerment potential by shaping gendered subjecthood in ways that are conducive to the maintenance of gender inequality. I conclude by discussing the implications of my findings for women’s empowerment in sport.",2022-10-01,Journal,Article,Gender and Society,14925,0,36,Breaking Barriers?

69,"© 2022 The Authors. British Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Psychological Society.This study augmented the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM) to assess reactive and deliberative decision-making underpinning bystander intervention in gender-based violence contexts. There were 2079 participants (50% male, 49% female, and 1% unreported), aged 11–15 years old (M = 12.32, SD = 0.91), attending 19 secondary schools across Scotland. Participants self-reported the augmented PWM variables, then their intervention behaviour approximately 1 month later. Path analyses mostly supported the predicted relationships between positive and negative bidimensional attitudes, subjective norms, prototype perceptions, perceived behavioural control, and self-efficacy on intentions and willingness. Willingness predicted positive (speaking with a teacher) and negative (doing nothing) intervention in less serious violence. Self-efficacy predicted negative intervention in more serious violence. Subjective norms positively moderated the attitudes–intentions relationship. Overall, the results suggested that reactive (willingness) more so than deliberative (intention) decision-making account for intervention when young people witness gender-based violence. Additionally, the findings highlight the complexity of bystander intervention decision-making, where adding control perceptions, bidimensional attitudes, and moderators have independent contributions. Furthermore, self-comparison to the typical bystander who positively intervenes (prototype perceptions) was the strongest predictor of intentions and willingness, highlighting in a novel way the importance of image and group membership on decision-making.",2022-10-01,Journal,Article,British Journal of Social Psychology,12776,1,61,Bystander intervention among secondary school pupils: Testing an augmented Prototype Willingness Model,1,true,10.1111/bjso.12534,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,British Journal of Social Psychology,2022.0,131.0,0.0,,69,51129712,Stefania Pagani,38766721,S.

70,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: The Healing after Gender-based Violence Scale (GBV-Heal) was developed to measure the holistic recovery processes of woman-identifying survivors of gender-based violence (GBV). The GBV-Heal asks survivors to evaluate a series of statements based on perceptions of one’s lowest point and how they currently feel. These scale response options create lowest point, current feelings, and difference scores to evaluate the healing outcome cross-sectionally. This manuscript aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the GBV-Heal to understand its usefulness for research and practice. Method: Instrument evaluation consisted of two phases analyzing online survey data from two GBV survivor samples recruited from online health research portals in the United States. In Phase One (N = 236), we conducted factor analyses and evaluated convergent/discriminant validity using depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and wellbeing measures. In Phase Two (N = 47), we evaluated GBV-Heal response consistency via test–retest within two weeks. Results: Results showed that the scale’s final model included 4 components with 18 items, explaining 61.2% and 65% of the overall scale variances for “at my lowest point” and “my current feelings,” respectively. The GBV-Heal difference score showed a weak positive correlation with wellbeing and posttraumatic growth scores and a weak negative correlation with depression, anxiety, and PTSD scores. Test–retest revealed Pearson r correlations of 0.82, 0.82, and 0.69 for the lowest point, current feelings, and difference scores respectively.

This study explores the disciplinary practices of parents in Kosovo using data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 5) collected in 2013 and 2014 through the household survey program supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Overall, 4127 household interviews were completed successfully, accounting for 5416 children aged 1–14. Respondents were asked about child discipline practices, including their attitudes toward violent and nonviolent discipline measures, and the association with sociodemographic correlates was analyzed. The results show that children in Kosovo are highly exposed to violent (61.4%) and nonviolent (31%) disciplinary practices, regardless of gender. In terms of sociodemographic correlates, children from urban areas and from the lowest wealth percentile seem to experience higher rates of violent discipline strategies. Mixed results were obtained regarding educational level of parents. Tolerant attitudes toward the use of physical violence were associated with increased odds ratios in the use of violent discipline practices, ranging from the lowest level of psychological aggression (OR = 2.75; 95% CI = 2.23–2.27) to the highest level of severe physical punishment (OR = 4.82; 95% CI = 3.68- 6.32).

Intervening post exposure is critical to help children and their protective parent heal and avoid long-term negative consequences.

Although there has been much research done on violence against women, there are few studies that provide the current scientific production. Methods: In this study, bibliometric analysis has been used to evaluate the 1984 documents from 1986 to 2020 based on the Scopus database. These documents were analyzed quantitatively by the Bibliometric R Package and the VOS viewer software. In addition, the 20 top-cited papers were analyzed qualitatively. Results: The research findings show that the United States is a leader in this field with the most highly cited articles and also the greatest number of publications followed by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and South Africa. A total of 1984 documents were collected from the Scopus database and were analyzed in the Bibliometric R Research Package and the VOSviewer software. The results demonstrated that the average citations per year for each document were 23.39% and the annual scientific production growth rate was 16.86%. The keywords analysis indicates that most articles focus on “sexual violence”, “sexual assault”, “intimate partner violence”, “violence against women”, “sexual abuse”, “domestic violence”, “child sexual abuse”, “prevention”, and “rape.” Sources such as the “Journal of Interpersonal Violence”, “Journal of Violence Against Woman”, “Journal of Violence and Victims”, “Psychology of Women Quarterly”, “Journal of Adolescent Health”, “Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology”, “American Journal of Public Health”, “Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology”, and “American Journal of Public Health”, and “The Lancet” are the top most productive in this field.

78,"© 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.Bystanders can play an important role in sexual aggression (SA) prevention, particularly those often present at bars and clubs where SA commonly occurs. Yet, more frequent patrons of bars and clubs may experience more barriers to intervening due to social norms that encourage aggression in these environments. Having greater confidence to intervene in SA may mitigate this relationship. This study examined these associations among 290 undergraduate students (Mage = 20.03; SDage = 20.03; 50% women) who completed measures of past semester bar and club attendance, bystander efficacy (i.e., confidence), and barriers to intervention. Moderation analyses using PROCESS indicated (1) a conditional main effect of bystander efficacy being associated with less failure to take intervention responsibility; (2) bar and club attendance was associated with less audience inhibition (i.e., failure to intervene due to concerns of looking foolish) among those higher (b =-0.30, p = 0.005), but not lower (b = 0.16, p = 0.183), in bystander efficacy.

Models were built separately for child welfare (CW) and non-CW adolescents in order to compare the variables selected as important features/risk factors. Method Data were from a Time 4 (Mage = 18.22) of longitudinal study of the effects of maltreatment on adolescent development (n = 350; CW = 222; non-CW = 128; 56%male). Marijuana use in the past 12 months (none versus any) was obtained from a single item self-report. Risk factors entered into the model included mental health, parent/family social support, peer risk behavior, self-reported risk behavior, self-esteem, and self-reported adversities (e.g., abuse, neglect, witnessing family violence or community violence). Results The ML approaches indicated 80% accuracy in predicting marijuana use in the CW group and 85% accuracy in the non-CW group. In addition, the top features differed for the CW and non-CW groups with peer marijuana use emerging as the most important risk factor for CW youth, whereas externalizing behavior was the most important for the non-CW group. The most important common risk factor between group was gender, with males having higher risk. Conclusions This is the first study to examine the shared and unique risk factors for marijuana use for CW and non-CW youth using a machine learning approach. The results support our assertion that there may be similar risk factors for both groups, but there are also risks unique to each population. Therefore, risk factors derived from normative populations may not have the same importance when used for CW youth. These differences should be considered in clinical practice when assessing risk for substance use among adolescents.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,17,Using machine learning to determine the shared and unique risk factors for marijuana use among child-welfare versus community adolescents,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0274998,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2022.0,89.0,0.0,,79,3739553,S.

80,"© 2022 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.Background Depression is one of the most serious yet understudied issues among Bangladeshi nurses, bringing health dangers to this workforce. This study aimed to investigate how workplace violence (WPV), bullying, burnout, and job satisfaction are correlated with depression and identify the factors associated with depression among Bangladeshi nurses. Methods For this cross-sectional study, data were collected between February 26, 2021, and July 10, 2021 from the Bangladeshi registered nurses. The Workplace Violence Scale (WPVS), the Short Negative Acts Questionnaire [S-NAQ], the Burnout Measure-Short version (BMS), the Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS-5), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure WPV, bullying, burnout, job satisfaction, and depression, respectively. Inferential statistics include Pearson's correlation test, t-test, one-way ANOVA test, multiple linear regression, and multiple hierarchal regression analyses were performed. Results The study investigated 1,264 nurses (70.02% female) with an average age of 28.41 years (SD = 5.54). Depression was positively correlated with WPV, bullying, and burnout and negatively correlated with job satisfaction (p <0.001). According to the multiple linear regression model, depression was significantly lower among nurses with diploma degrees (β = -1.323, 95% CI = -2.149 to -0.497) and bachelor's degrees (β = -1.327, 95% CI = -2.131 to- 0.523) compared to the nurses with master's degree. The nurses who worked extended hours (>48 hours) had a significantly higher depression score (β = 1.490, 95% CI = 0.511 to 2.470) than those who worked ≤ 36 hours. Depression was found to be significantly higher among those who did not receive a timely salary (β = 2.136, 95% CI = 1.138 to 3.134), rewards for good works (β = 1.862, 95% CI = 1.117 to 2.607), and who had no training on WPV (β = 0.895, 95% CI = 0.092 to 1.698). Conclusions Controlling burnout, bullying, and workplace violence, as well as improving the work environment for nurses and increasing job satisfaction, are the essential indicators of reducing depression. This can be accomplished with integrative support from hospital executives, policymakers, and government officials.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,1,17,"Workplace violence, bullying, burnout, job satisfaction and their correlation with depression among Bangladeshi nurses: A cross-sectional survey during the COVID-19 pandemic",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0274965,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2022.0,78.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Controlling burnout, bullying, and workplace violence, as well as improving the work environment for nurses and increasing job satisfaction, are the essential indicators of reducing depression.'}",80,1517242880,S.

81,"© 2022 by the authors.Defining the typologies of adolescent girls in relation to different types of victimization against women could be very useful for prevention. Almost all the typologies previously elaborated on this topic define the typologies from situations of dating victimization. This study used cluster analysis to establish for the first time a typology of adolescent girl victimization against women that included dating violence offline, dating violence online, and sexual harassment online outside a relationship by means of a comparative analysis of behavior between those who had suffered this violence and the population at large. The participants were 3.532 Spanish teenage girls aged 14–18 with experience of relationships with boys. Three discrete, identifiable types were obtained: the first group (63.8%), non-victim girls; the second group (29.4%), victims of sexual harassment online outside a relationship but with a low incidence of dating victimization; the third group (6.8%), victims in the three contexts. The logistic regression analysis showed that risky sexual behavior online was the main risk condition for inclusion in the second and third groups (compared to the non-victim group), followed by low self-esteem (for the second group) and age (for both groups). Other variables that also contributed to predicting membership victim groups were health complaints, feminine gender role stress, justification of male dominance and violence, visiting risky websites, and problematic internet use. These results show the importance of including the prevention of such problems in order to eradicate violence against women in adolescence who have grown up with digital technologies.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,"Typology of Victimization against Women on Adolescent Girls in Three Contexts: Dating Offline, Dating Online, and Sexual Harassment Online",1,true,10.3390/ijerph191811774,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,53.0,0.0,,81,1423438420,M.

This study aimed to identify, through a qualitative methodology and a Delphi consensus-driven process, a set of recommendations for the management of DS to guide clinicians in the assessment of the clinical condition and quality of life (QoL) of DS patients, with a special focus on patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes (PROs). Methods: This study was conducted in five phases, led by a multidisciplinary scientific committee (SC) including pediatric neurologists, epileptologists, a neuropsychologist, an epilepsy nurse, and members of DS patient advocates. In phases 1 and 2, a questionnaire related to patients' QoL was prepared and answered by caregivers and the SC. In phase 3, the SC generated, based on these answers and on a focus group discussion, a 70-item Delphi questionnaire, covering six topic categories on a nine-point Likert scale. In phase 4, 32 panelists, from different Spanish institutions and with a multidisciplinary background, answered the questionnaire. Consensus was obtained and defined as strong or moderate if ≥80% and 67–79% of panelists, respectively, rated the statement with ≥7. Phase 5 consisted of the preparation of the manuscript. Results: The panelists agreed on a total of 69 items (98.6%), 54 (77.14%), and 15 (21.43%) with strong and moderate consensus, respectively. The experts' recommendations included the need for frequent assessment of patient and caregivers QoL parameters. The experts agreed that QoL should be assessed through specific questionnaires covering different domains. Likewise, the results showed consensus regarding the regular evaluation of several clinical parameters related to neurodevelopment, attention, behavior, other comorbidities, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). A consensus was also reached on the instruments, specific parameters, and caregivers' education in the routine clinical management of patients with DS. Conclusions: This consensus resulted in a set of recommendations for the assessment of clinical and QoL parameters, including PROs, related to the general evaluation of QoL, neurodevelopment, attention, behavior, other comorbidities affecting QoL, SUDEP, and QoL of caregivers/relatives and patients with DS.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,Frontiers in Neurology,21100212316,0,13,The Charlotte Project: Recommendations for patient-reported outcomes and clinical parameters in Dravet syndrome through a qualitative and Delphi consensus study,1,true,10.3389/fneur.2022.975034,Frontiers Media S.A.,Frontiers in Neurology,2022.0,68.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results showed consensus regarding the regular evaluation of several clinical parameters related to neurodevelopment, attention, behavior, other comorbidities, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) related to the general evaluation of QoL.'}",82,1398594719,Á.

As such, large-scale quantitative data detailing the profile, needs and outcomes of abused men, upon both presentation and use of services, is currently lacking. The present study analyzed the client data of 719 callers to a domestic abuse helpline for men in the UK. Findings showed that the overwhelming majority of callers reported they were abused by female perpetrators, most of whom were still their current partner, and that many of the men were fathers. Vulnerable populations (GBTQ+ and disabled men) were under-represented in the sample. Most men were seeking emotional support, along with a range of practical advice and signposting to other services. The confidentiality of the helpline was crucial for many men, and almost half had struggled to access the service (suggesting a severe lack of resourcing).

84,"© 2022 by the authors.Background. Invisible violence against women (IVAW) can be understood as the set of attitudes, behaviors, and subtle beliefs that men use to subordinate women and that are culturally accepted. These behaviors can be a risk factor for intimate partner violence (IPV), so it is important to design tools that allow us to detect it early. The aim of this study was to design and psychometrically assess a questionnaire for the detection of invisible violence against women (Q-IVAW). Methodology. A descriptive cross-sectional methodological study carried out in three phases: (1) development of the initial version; (2) pilot study (N = 51); and (3) final validation study (N = 990). The tool’s reliability, validity, and legibility were assessed. To assess reliability, the internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) was analyzed. The validity assessment included an analysis of content, criterion, and construct validity. Results. The EFA revealed that the Q-IVAW was comprised of five factors that explained 55.85% of the total variance found. The Q-IVAW showed very high reliability (α = 0.937), excellent content validity, and good construct validity. The criterion validity analysis showed a moderate correlation between A-IPVAW and Q-IVAW (r = 0.30; p < 0.001). Conclusion. The psychometric assessment of the Q-IVAW yielded good results, which could support the tool’s ability to assess how often women are subjected to inviable violent behaviors by their partners.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,Development and Psychometric Assessment of a Questionnaire for the Detection of Invisible Violence against Women,1,true,10.3390/ijerph191711127,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,85.0,0.0,,84,1712248952,Iria Dobarrio-Sanz,2180687990,A.

86,"© 2022 by the authors.(1) Background: The loss of a significant person can be especially traumatic when death comes without warning and is due to causes such as suicide, murder and accidents. The way an individual is informed about the loss can affect the way of adapting to the loss and the quality of life of survivors. Communication modalities of the notifier may deeply influence the bereavement process. Aim: The present investigation aimed to explore the experience of those who received communication of such a type of death by a professional figure. (2) Method: Snowball sampling was used to recruit the participants to this qualitative study. Social networks, word of mouth and researchers’ acquaintances were used, including clients of the NGO De Leo Fund. A total of 52 Italian people (eight males and forty four females, mean age = 49.44; SD = 14.23) who received notification of the death of a loved one by police officers or by health professionals participated in the study. Deaths involved cases of suicide, murder, road accident and mountain accident. (3) Results: The following four key themes were identified: (a) how the communication took place; (b) reactions; (c) support; and (d) coping strategies. Only 22 participants reported having received clear information about the dynamics of what happened; the rest of the sample obtained only poor or ambiguous information. The majority of participants sought or received informal support from family and friends immediately after notification; however, some participants experienced a total lack of support. The opportunity to see the body of the loved one for the last farewell, when denied, caused discomfort in recipients of the news. (4) Conclusions: Even the impactful notification of a traumatic death such as suicide or road accident can be mitigated by the appropriate behaviour and attitude of notifiers, who should always avoid providing generic or ambiguous information about what happened. The notification process should not end with the simple transmission of the communication, but should also look at the following phases by including referral to supportive networks or bereavement services, aimed at assisting individuals in the immediate aftermath but also in the long term.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,Receiving Notification of Unexpected and Violent Death: A Qualitative Study of Italian Survivors,1,true,10.3390/ijerph191710709,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,66.0,0.0,,86,78546386,D. de Leo,2183426098,Annalisa Guarino,2183428648,Benedetta Congregalli,1962341241,Josephine Zammarrelli,2183385345,Anna Valle,14446100,S.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licenseBackground: Sexual harassment and violence in the workplace are a serious public health concern for women worldwide with substantial costs due to sick leave and personnel turnover. Yet little is known about the prevalence of sexual harassment and violence at a population level, especially across work sectors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of workplace sexual harassment and violence by demographic factors and work sectors among Icelandic women. Methods: For this cross-sectional study we analysed nationally representative, de-identified individual-level data from women who had responded to an online survey item about self-labelled current and lifetime workplace sexual harassment or violence as part of the Stress and Gene Analysis (SAGA) study, a cross-sectional nationally representative study done from March 1, 2018, to July 1, 2019. Eligible participants were women who resided in Iceland, were aged between 18 and 69 years, spoke Icelandic, and had a registered address from the Icelandic Population Register or a telephone number from the online 1819 service. We used binomial and Poisson regression analysis to study the cross-sectional association between workplace sexual harassment and violence and demographic factors (eg, age, sexual orientation, and education) and factors relating to the workplace (eg, work schedule), across works sectors. Findings: Of 113 814 eligible women, 104 197 were invited to complete the online survey, of whom 30 403 women responded and were included in the SAGA cohort. 15 799 women answered the item about exposure to workplace sexual harassment or violence. 11 286 [71·4%] of 15 799 women answered the question about sexual orientation that were included in the survey from June, 2018. 5291 (33·5%) of 15 799 of participants reported having experienced workplace sexual harassment or violence during their lifetime, and 1178 (7·5%) in their current workplace. Such exposure in the current workplace was most common among women who were young (age 18–24 years: prevalence ratio [PR] 3·89 [95% CI 2·66–5·71]; age 25–35 years: 3·66 [2·53–5·31]), single (1·27 [1·12–1·43]), and worked shifts (2·32 [2·02–2·67]), with the highest prevalence rates observed among women in work sectors of public figures (15·67 [9·34–25·12]), tourism (15·01 [11·01–20·13]), and the legal system and security (13·56 [7·00–24·66]). Lifetime exposure to workplace sexual harassment or violence was more common among women who belonged to sexual minorities than among heterosexual women (PR 1·35 [1·24–1·46]). Interpretation: Lifetime exposure to workplace sexual harassment or violence seems common among women in a Nordic welfare state. These findings provide nuanced targets for prevention and for public policies aimed at promoting women's safety in the work environment.

Studies were identified via a systematic search on the PubMed, CINAHL Plus (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete), Scopus, and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) databases and a manual reverse reference search to obtain literature published between 2015 and 2020. The methodology followed the recommendations made by Whittemore & Knafl. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Critical Skills Appraisal Program tool. Twenty-three of the 4202 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The principal barriers identified were lack of training for professionals (mainly nurses and midwives), lack of support policies, and lack of human and material resources. The main facilitators were to increase professional training programs on case detection, availability of effective instruments, and greater investment in resources to guarantee safety and referral of cases. With regard to the available tools, the Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS) continues to be the most widely used, although others such as the Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, and Kick questionnaire (HARK) could be suitable for antenatal care settings.",2022-09-01,Journal,Review,Nursing and Health Sciences,28826,0,24,"Integrative review of the literature on screening for gender-based violence during pregnancy: Barriers, facilitators, and tools",1,true,10.1111/nhs.12967,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Nursing and Health Sciences,2022.0,69.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An integrative review of the literature to explore barriers and facilitators in screening for gender‐based violence in pregnant women and identify available tools for this screening found the Abuse Assessment Screen continues to be the most widely used.'}",90,1705438569,Laura Andreu-Pejó,2171604849,Mª Jesús Valero Chillerón,9813768,V.

91,"© 2022Background: Nursing students regularly work with women who have experienced intimate partner violence in their clinical placements and subsequently as registered nurses. They have a role in early detection, intervention, onward referral and education of women about intimate partner violence. Therefore, it is necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of their capability to care for abused women and identify learning needs. Nonetheless, the level of preparedness of nursing students to deal with intimate partner violence has not been reviewed. Aim: To search and review the existing evidence on nursing students' knowledge, attitudes, preparedness and practice towards intimate partner violence. Method: This scoping review was guided using the PRISMA extension checklist for scoping reviews. Four databases were searched to identify relevant evidence published between 2010 and 2021. The review included eighteen empirical studies (10 quantitative, 4 qualitative and 4 mixed-method studies). Data were extracted and synthesized into seven themes. Result: Nursing students were more knowledgeable of and readily recognized physical and sexual abuse than psychological abuse. Nursing students' roles and attitudes varied widely between different countries. Students faced difficulty in identifying and managing intimate partner violence clinically.

92,"© 2022 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.The assessment of national suicide risks is considered critical in many countries for the establishment of suicide prevention initiatives aimed at considerably lowering suicide rates. The aim of this study is to identify at-risk suicide populations by reviewing the suicides in Turkey over a 25-year period. The Turkish Statistical Institute's suicide statistics for 1995–2019 in Turkey was retrospectively reviewed in current article. The data collected in the study was statistically analyzed using the MINITAB vn 14 software. Between 1995 and 2019, the total number of suicides in Turkey was 66,819, and suicide rates, especially in males, showed an increasing trend in this period. Males comprised 68.3% of the total cases, and most (27.2%) were aged 15–24 years. Suicides mostly occurred between May and July (27.7%), of individuals with a primary school level of education (51.7%) and who were married (6.0 per 100,000). Illness was most important risk factor for suicide (36.8%) and hanging (47.5%) was the leading suicide method in all age groups and in both genders. Despite the fact that Turkey's suicide rate is lower than many other countries, the growth in male suicide rates is concerning. Suicides are likely to become a severe problem in Turkey in the near future unless measures like education, psychiatric evaluations, the reactivation of psychological counseling service phone lines, and the establishment of youth counseling centers, as described in this paper, are taken.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Forensic Sciences,27769,0,67,Suicides in Turkey: 25-year trend (1995–2019),0,false,10.1111/1556-4029.15086,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Journal of Forensic Sciences,2022.0,73.0,0.0,,92,32336045,Erhan Kartal,2154992106,U.

93,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Objective: Assessing access to sexual and reproductive health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, experiences with intimate partner violence (IPV), and exploring sociodemographic disparities Study Design: From September 2020 to January 2021, we recruited 436 individuals assigned female at birth (18−49 years.) in Georgia, USA for an online survey. The final convenience sample was n = 423; a response rate could not be calculated. Survey themes included: sociodemographic and financial information, access to contraceptive services/care, IPV, and pregnancy. Respondents who reported a loss of health insurance, difficulty accessing contraception, barriers to medical care, or IPV were characterized as having a negative sexual and reproductive health experience during the pandemic. We explored associations between sociodemographic variables and negative sexual and reproductive health experiences. Results: Since March 2020, 66/436 (16%) of respondents lost their health insurance, and 45% (89/436) reported income loss. Of our sample, 144/436 people (33%) attempted to access contraception. The pandemic made contraceptive access more difficult for 38/144 (26%) of respondents; however, 106/144 (74%) said it had no effect or positive effect on access. Twenty-one respondents reported IPV (5%). COVID-19 amplified negative views of unplanned pregnancy. Seventy-six people (18%) reported at least 1 negative sexual and reproductive health experience during the pandemic; people in an urban setting and those identifying as homo/bisexual were more likely to report negative experiences (24%, 28% respectively). Conclusion: Urban and sexual minority populations had negative sexual and reproductive health experiences during COVID-19 more than their counterparts. The pandemic has shifted perspectives on family planning, likely due to the diverse impacts of COVID-19, including loss of health insurance and income. Implication: Females across Georgia reported varying impacts of the COVID-19’s pandemic on their sexual and reproductive health care.

94,"© 2022 Emergency Nurses AssociationIntroduction: Urban ED patients have elevated rates of substance use and intimate partner violence. The purpose of this study is to describe the risk profiles for intimate partner violence among urban ED patients who report at-risk alcohol use only, cannabis use only, or both types of substance use. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data were collected from study participants (N = 1037; 53% female; ages 18-50) following informed consent. We measured participants’ past-year at-risk drinking (women/men who had 4+/5+ drinks in a day), cannabis use, psychosocial and demographic characteristics, and past-year physical intimate partner violence (assessed with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale). We used bivariate analysis to assess whether rates of intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization differed by type of substance use behavior. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated for each intimate partner violence outcome. All analyses were stratified by gender. Results: Rates of intimate partner violence differed significantly by type of substance use behavior and were highest among those who reported both at-risk drinking and cannabis use. Multivariate analysis showed that women who reported at-risk drinking only, cannabis use only, or both types of substance use had increased odds for intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization compared with women who reported neither type of substance use. Men's at-risk drinking and cannabis use were not associated with elevated odds of intimate partner violence perpetration or victimization.

95,"© 2022 National Rural Health Association.Purpose: Few studies have simultaneously assessed age and gender trends in homicide and suicide across the rural-urban continuum. Herein, we examine geographic and demographic trends in suicide and homicide death rates by: (1) determining overall macro and disaggregated trends; (2) examining differences in trends based on rural-urban county classification; and (3) identifying differences in stratified trends among age and gender classifications. Methods: A retrospective study design used suicide and homicide data (n = 199,456) from years 2005to 2017 across 16 US states. Suicide and homicide deaths were grouped by age, gender, and rural-urban classification for descriptive analyses, and trends were analyzed using Joinpoint trend analysis software. Findings: Violence resulted in 142,470 suicide and 56,986 homicide deaths between 2005 and 2017. Among both males and females, overall macro trends of suicide and homicide rates generally increased with greater rurality, and trends in rural rates differed from those in nonrural areas. Joinpoint trend analysis revealed significant increases in male suicide rates in large metropolitan (1.66%), micropolitan (1.78%), and rural areas (1.77%); female suicide rates in large metropolitan (2.17%), small metropolitan (3.25%), and micropolitan areas (3.26%); male homicide rates in large metropolitan areas (10.19%); and female homicide rates in rural areas (8.29%). Finally, when stratified by age, several significant trends were found, including increases in suicide rates among females aged 64 and older in rural areas (11.71%). Conclusions: Heterogeneous trends were found in suicide and homicide rates within specific rural-urban, age, and gender subgroups. Prevention efforts should proactively target those subgroups identified herein as most at-risk of violence.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Rural Health,16003,0,38,"Rural-urban, age, and gender disparities and trends in suicide and homicide: Multistate evidence across 12 years",0,false,10.1111/jrh.12670,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Journal of Rural Health,2022.0,27.0,0.0,,95,10444934,M.

96,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Although research demonstrates intergenerational transmission of parenting attitudes and child abuse risk, greater clarity on the potential mechanisms in this process is needed. Role-specific modeling refers to an individual’s tendency to adopt the attitudes or behaviors of those in roles they themselves expect to ultimately occupy. How gender influences role-specific modeling—namely, how emerging adults align with same-gender parents—has not been well examined in this intergenerational transmission. The current study used a multi-informant approach to examine the associations between emerging adults’ child abuse potential, parenting style history, and expected parenting styles and their parents’ child abuse potential and parenting styles. Further, whether maternal and paternal parenting styles were concordant versus discordant was also considered in relation to emerging adults’ child abuse potential. In a multi-phase study, the first phase included 867 emerging adults; the second phase included a sample of these emerging adults’ mothers (n = 237) and fathers (n = 176). Both mothers’ and fathers’ parenting style and abuse potential related to emerging adults’ abuse potential, with more pronounced effects for daughters. Results indicated gender-specific modeling was not apparent in emerging adults’ abuse risk, alternatively suggesting potential cross-gender effects. Concordance in both parents adopting an authoritative parenting style resulted in emerging adults’ significantly lower child abuse risk compared to those with any authoritarian parenting history. Findings indicated the importance of mothers’ and fathers’ use of an authoritative approach to parenting, which may be critical for the prevention of intergenerationally sustained harsh and abusive parenting.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Child and Family Studies,15399,1,31,Examining Gender-Specific Modeling in the Intergenerational Transmission of Parenting Style and Physical Child Abuse Risk,0,false,10.1007/s10826-022-02232-1,Springer,Journal of Child and Family Studies,2022.0,86.0,0.0,,96,1657515870,Samantha Gonzalez,3554825,C.

97,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.In the aftermath of the global #Metoo-movement, sexual harassment (SH) and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV) have emerged at the forefront of public debate and research. Higher education instituions (HEI) worldwide have responded with different preventive measures, targeting context-specific challenges and solutions. In India, post the enactment of the law on prevention and repatriation of SH of women at work in 2013, governing bodies in HE have issued several policies and guidelines. However, almost no empirical studies have explored the implementation and consequences of these initiatives. This pioneering study explores the Indian experiences of procedural change in this sense, through the challenges faced by internal complaints committee members. A specific focus in the analysis is on the members discourses on executing the quasi-legal and behavioural mandates of the law. In conclusion, ambiguities within the law as such, misrecognized cognitive biases in committee members narratives, and a lack of adequate conversation on GBV and SH sums up to identified bureaucratic grey zones. Several recommendations on context specific preventive measures are suggested as well as core recommendations on future research targeting prevention of GBV and SH in HEI more generally.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,Higher Education,18787,0,84,Moving beyond bureaucratic grey zones.

Due to the anonymous and unrestrictive nature of the internet, cyber violence is even more blatant and pervasive than in person violence for sexual minority individuals. The present study aimed to examine whether and how online and offline experiences of heterosexism are related to physical and mental health. A total of 941 sexual minority individuals participated in a community-based online survey study. The findings indicated that online heterosexist experiences explained variance in physical and mental health, beyond the contribution of offline heterosexist experiences. Among sexual minority young adults, the effect of online heterosexist experiences on mental health was stronger than that of offline heterosexist experiences, whereas the association between online heterosexist experiences and health problems was not observed in the adult sample. The results of mediation analysis showed that heterosexist experiences were related to heightened expectations of rejection, which, in turn, were related to poor physical and mental health. The association of heterosexist experiences and mental health was also mediated by negative affect. Given the detrimental effect of online heterosexist experiences, effective interventions are needed to combat cyber violence motivated by sexual orientation and enhance the coping and confrontation strategies in response to harmful online content.",2022-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,5,37,Effects of Online Heterosexist Experiences on Physical and Mental Health in Sexual Minorities: An Examination of the Cognitive and Affective Mechanisms,0,false,10.1177/08862605211021962,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2021.0,65.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings indicated that online heterosexist experiences explained variance in physical and mental health, beyond the contribution of offline heteroseXist experiences, among sexual minority young adults.'}",98,34940640,Randolph C.

Data were obtained from 88,219 adolescents in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey. Gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and experiences with teen dating violence were measured for each youth. Tested two- and three-way interactions demonstrate varied outcomes by social identification and emphasize the need for an intersectional approach in dating violence research. Adolescent dating violence was most prevalent among girls (10% physical, 13% sexual); adolescents were racially identified as Native North American (13% physical, 10% sexual), Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (12% physical, 14% sexual), or multiracial (11% physical, 12% sexual), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning their sexual orientation (LGBQ) adolescents (19% physical, 20% sexual). The intersectional groups with the highest rates of physical and sexual dating violence included Latinx GBQ boys (26% physical, 26% sexual) and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander GBQ boys (29% physical, 32% sexual). Among girls, highest rates were observed among Hawaiian/Pacific Islander LBQ (24% physical, 23% sexual). Externalizing symptoms associated with physical dating violence were most robust for risky sexual behavior (OR = 4.0), followed by physical fighting (OR = 3.0), and weapon carrying (OR = 2.5); they were also associated with sexual dating violence (ORs = 1.9-2.2). Internalizing symptoms were comparably associated with both types of dating violence (ORs = 2.6-2.9 physical and ORs = 2.4-2.8 sexual).

101,"© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Given the role leaders play in organizational effectiveness, there is growing interest in understanding the antecedents of leader emergence. The authors consider parental influence by examining how witnessing interparental violence during adolescence indirectly affects adult leader role occupancy. Drawing on the work–home resources (W-HR) model, the authors hypothesize that witnessing interparental violence serves as a distal, chronic contextual demand that hinders leader role occupancy through its effects on constructive personal resources, operationalized as insecure attachment. Based on role congruity theory, the authors also predict that the relationship between attachment style and leader role occupancy will differ for women and men. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the authors used data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) (n = 1,665 full-time employees). Findings: After controlling for age, education, childhood socioeconomic status and experienced violence, results showed that the negative indirect effects of witnessing interparental violence on leader role occupancy through avoidant attachment was significant for females only, while the negative effects of anxious attachment hindered leader role occupancy across sexes. Originality/value: Results identify novel distal (interparental violence) and proximal (attachment style) barriers to leader role occupancy, showing empirical support for the life-span approach to leadership and the persistent effects of home demands on work.",2022-08-16,Journal,Article,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion",19900191744,0,41,Witnessing interparental violence and leader role occupancy: the roles of insecure attachment and gender,0,false,10.1108/EDI-10-2021-0279,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal",2022.0,99.0,0.0,,101,31963453,A.

Networks carrying females for sex work are bigger and use more fraudulent recruitment strategies. However, migrant smuggling for agriculture is not totally different from sex trafficking; similarities between the types of networks analysed dwarf their differences.

Data were obtained from two mock trials and 12 questionnaire responses. The sample consisted of 12 women participants aged from 20 to 25. The thematic analysis indicated that participants who received rape myths education exhibited resistance to rape myths, increased scrutiny of the defendant as opposed to the complainant, and less disbelief of the complainant’s alleged behaviours. Quantitative analysis suggested a strong positive correlation between the understanding of rape myths education and its influence on decision making; however, this was only found in the intervention group.

105,"© 2022 by the authors.The phenomenon of adolescent dating violence directed towards women is a widespread social health problem all over the world. Various investigations over time have analysed and studied this problem from different perspectives, taking into account both the aggressors and the victims. However, apart from these perspectives there are other approaches that have been less explored. This study analyses the phenomenon from a cultural point of view. It looks at the way in which variables such as hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and the perception of severity attributed to violent behaviour perpetrated by the aggressor can differ depending on the country of origin of a group of victimized adolescent women, specifically, from Spain and Ecuador. The data analysis, based on the construction of a moderated mediation model, revealed that while hostile sexism seems to be linked to a greater extent with traditional cultures, benevolent sexism is highly relevant in today’s society, and modifies the severity that young female victims attribute to violent behaviour and ultimately affects the frequency of victimization. These results revealed the importance of culture and the way in which violence is perceived in different countries as an essential aspect that must be taken into account to guide the construction of effective prevention programs adapted to the specific target groups of adolescents.",2022-08-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,"Influence of Cross-Cultural Factors about Sexism, Perception of Severity, Victimization, and Gender Violence in Adolescent Dating Relationships",1,true,10.3390/ijerph191610356,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,96.0,0.0,,105,1398947095,I.

106,"© 2022 by the authors.The literature on behavioral outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is inundated with mental health burdens such as depression and stress disorders. The current study investigated gender invariance on resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) as positive psychological changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 381 survivors of the COVID-19 infection completed measurements of resilience, PTG, violence and stigma experience, and mental health problems like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, multivariate regression, and a latent profile analysis. The results revealed that more than half of the participants had high scores on resilience (53.6%) and PTG (60.9%). The positive psychological changes, although independent of each other, were moderated by gender, and influenced by the negative experiences of participants such as stigma, violence, and PTSD. Latent profile analyses revealed three classes of participants, two of which were characterized by high scores on mental health problems and PTG. The clusters were invariant across gender.

107,"© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The Ambivalent Sexism Theory suggests that there are two complementary types of sexism: hostile (subjectively negative attitude towards gender groups) and benevolent (subjectively positive attitude towards gender groups). In this meta-analysis we analysed the relationship between ambivalent sexism and attitudes toward male-to-female violence or violent behaviour. Violence type, the context of violence, respondents’ gender, the countries’ level of gender inequality, and sample type were tested as moderators. The results showed that both hostile and benevolent sexism independently impact on attitudes toward violence and violent behaviour albeit to a different degree. Specifically, the relationship between hostile sexism and attitudes and behaviour is stronger than for the benevolent sexism. The type and context of violence moderate the relationship between hostile sexism and attitudes toward violence and violent behaviour.

108,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Adolescent violence, including sexual violence, homophobic name-calling, and teen dating violence, are public health problems that cause harm to many adolescents in the United States. Although research on the perpetration of these forms of adolescent violence has increased in recent years, little is known about perpetration rates across gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. To address this gap, the current study descriptively examined perpetration rates between and across different identities, including self-identified race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and gender identity. In Fall 2017, 9th – 11th grade students (N = 4782) at 20 high schools in Colorado (United States) completed a survey that assessed demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and gender identity) and various forms of violence perpetration. Compared to female adolescents, male adolescents reported significantly higher perpetration rates for: any sexual violence (27% vs. 17%); sexual harassment (26% vs. 15%); unwanted sexual contact (8% vs. 4%); and homophobic name-calling (61% vs. 38%). Differences in perpetration rates were also observed among various racial/ethnic, sexual, and gender minority students compared to non-minority students. This emphasizes a need for more research on how minority stress that results from the dynamics of intersecting identities and societal systems of power–including racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia–contributes to violence perpetration. Evidence-based violence prevention approaches, particularly strategies targeted at changing social norms about violence, gender, and sexuality, need to be tailored and evaluated for students with diverse cultural and social identities to ensure safe school climates for all students.",2022-08-01,Journal,Article,Preventive Medicine,17665,0,161,"Violence perpetration prevalence among Colorado (United States) high school students across gender, racial/ethnic, and sexual identities",1,true,10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107146,Academic Press Inc.,Preventive Medicine,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,108,3160025,D.

Medical Journal of Australia published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of AMPCo Pty Ltd.Gender-based violence includes intimate partner violence, sexual violence and other harmful acts directed at people based on their gender. It is common in Australia and causes great ill health, especially for women victims/survivors, with Indigenous women particularly affected. Health services are an opportune place for early intervention for victims/survivors of gender-based violence as they attend frequently. Interventions that are evidence-based and respond to consensus from victim/survivor voices include universal education, screening in antenatal care, first line supportive care, and referral for advocacy and psychological interventions, including mother–child work. Health care staff require training, protocols, scripts, referral pathways, understanding of cultural safety and antiracist practice in service delivery, and leadership support to undertake this sensitive work, including support, if needed, for their own experiences of gender-based violence. Using a trauma-, violence- and gender-informed approach across health systems, taking into account structural inequities, is essential to sustain the gender-based violence work in health services.

110,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal MedicineThe purpose of this descriptive study was to investigate overkill in a representative sample of Greek psychiatric patients found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRIs) from a forensic psychiatric - criminological standpoint and explore possible correlations of the phenomenon with socio-cultural or psychiatric factors. Overall, 24 forensic psychiatric records of overkill offenders were identified throughout the 5-year records of the national forensic psychiatric service in northern Greek mainland. The pattern that has emerged from the statistical results of the present study on the victims of overkill within the Greek borders was generally in line with global literature on homicide perpetrators. The mean age of overkill offenders (at the time of enactment of the crime) was estimated at 36.3 years ranging from 19 to 55 years (variance = 146.72; standard deviation = 12.11). The number of male single-offence killers was ten-times larger compared to their female counterparts, while the number of male multiple-offence killers were three-times larger compared to their female counterparts. Male offenders were averagely 15 years younger (mean 33.7; variance = 81.69; standard deviation = 9) in comparison to female offenders, and single-offence killers were averagely ten years younger compared to multiple-offence killers (mean 40.2; variance = 185.19; standard deviation = 13.6). The phenomenon correlated more strongly with homicides in the context of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (80–100%) as well as domestic violence. Overall, males outnumbered females both as offenders (approximately five-times) and victims (approximately three-times), but regarding domestic violence, the sad majority of overkill victims stood for females murdered by their male relatives. Close female relatives (especially mothers and grandmothers) were most often victimized. Female-perpetrated overkill was directed against male individuals with whom offenders shared a relationship (intimate partners and minors). An important finding was the fact that three-quarters of the overall perpetrator sample were under prescribed medication at the time of offence, but with a very low compliance rate (5.6%). This last particular finding of the present study demonstrated that mental health services within community in Greece may unfortunately have been ineffective in addressing issues requiring risk assessment and timely intervention.",2022-08-01,Journal,Review,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,5100154502,0,90,The phenomenon of overkill in northern Greece: A descriptive forensic psychiatric study between 2015 and 2020 on criminal offenders found not guilty by reason of insanity,0,false,10.1016/j.jflm.2022.102387,Churchill Livingstone,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,2022.0,74.0,0.0,,110,11666745,M.

115,"© 2021 SAGE Publications.Although there is growing evidence that receiving positive emotional support (e.g., empathy) facilitates improved mental health outcomes among intimate partner violence (IPV) victims, there has been minimal exploration of factors that might undermine the likelihood of such supportive responses. The current study addressed this issue by examining whether exposure to sexualized music videos would affect IPV victim-directed empathic responding of third-party respondents. In a three-condition design, 243 female Fijian university students viewed sexualized, nonsexualized, or neutral music videos. They then read about a male-to-female IPV incident involving a university student victim who focused heavily on academic success and rated aspiration-related culpability and empathic responding for the victim. Relative to those who viewed neutral and nonsexualized videos, those who viewed the sexualized video reported less victim-directed empathy. Moreover, the impact of video type on empathy was mediated by aspiration-related culpability (i.e., the perception that the victim studied too much). The present research examined, in an understudied, patriarchal population (Fijian women) with an extremely high rate of IPV, how exposure to sexualized music videos can contribute to both greater blame and greater desensitization to the suffering of an IPV victim. The importance of studying third-party responders (bystanders) is that they may represent a fundamental resource for the victim, or by contrast, if they fail to respond empathically, they would be unsupportive to a victim.

Findings suggested that 30% of the present sample were severely disturbed or exaggerating their symptoms. As expected, there were significant levels of exaggerated profiles present in the severe pathology group and significant levels of minimized profiles in the low pathology group. Self-referred participants were more likely to exaggerate their pathology, but minimization was not associated with referral status.

120,"© 2022 The Author(s)Gender-related violence against women and its lethal outcome, feminicide, are a serious problem throughout the world. Official government data on gender violence and feminicide are often absent, incomplete, infrequently updated, and contested. We draw on data feminism to situate feminicide data as missing data. Building on qualitative interviews, this study discusses the informatic work of ten activist and civil society organizations across six countries who combat missing data by producing counterdata. Activists enact alternative epistemological approaches to data science that center care, memory, and justice. Activists also face significant information challenges that increase monitoring labor and add emotional burden to reading about violent deaths. This work contributes to literature on data activism and critical data studies, proposing feminicide data practices as an important research subject.

122,"© 2022 by the authors.Suffering intimate partner violence (IPV) is a devastating personal experience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a positive, psychological change in a person, following trauma such as IPV. There is a gap in the literature when it comes to theories on PTG after surviving IPV. The aim of this theory development was to synthesize an approach to understanding the PTG journey of female IPV survivors. According to our theory, their PTG journey includes eight main components: 1. The women’s early experience of trauma, 2. The consequences of that trauma, 3. Their experiences of IPV, 4. The consequences of IPV, 5. The facilitating factors to PTG, 6. The hindering factors to PTG, 7. Their experience of PTG, and 8. The lingering effects of IPV. According to our findings, PTG is a real possibility for female IPV survivors, and it is likely to improve their mental health, well-being, and quality of life, as well as that of their children, loved ones, and communities, thereby decreasing the damaging effects of IPV. The theory can be useful for professionals when guiding female survivors of IPV to promote their recovery and healing.

123,"© 2022 by the authors.Intimate partner violence (IPV) may be a major concern in military and veteran populations, and the aims of this systematic review were to (1) provide best available estimates of overall prevalence based on studies that are most representative of relevant populations, and (2) contextualise these via examination of IPV types, impacts, and context. An electronic search of PsycINFO, CINHAL, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases identified studies utilising population-based designs or population screening strategies to estimate prevalence of IPV perpetration or victimisation reported by active duty (AD) military personnel or veterans. Random effects meta-analyses were used for quantitative analyses and were supplemented by narrative syntheses of heterogeneous data. Thirty-one studies involving 172,790 participants were included in meta-analyses. These indicated around 13% of all AD personnel and veterans reported any recent IPV perpetration, and around 21% reported any recent victimisation. There were higher rates of IPV perpetration in studies of veterans and health service settings, but no discernible differences were found according to gender, era of service, or country of origin. Psychological IPV was the most common form identified, while there were few studies of IPV impacts, or coercive and controlling behaviours. The findings demonstrate that IPV perpetration and victimisation occur commonly among AD personnel and veterans and highlight a strong need for responses across military and veteran-specific settings. However, there are gaps in understanding of impacts and context for IPV, including coercive and controlling behaviours, which are priority considerations for future research and policy.",2022-07-01,Journal,Review,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,2,19,Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in Military and Veteran Populations: A Systematic Review of Population-Based Surveys and Population Screening Studies,1,true,10.3390/ijerph19148853,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,111.0,0.0,,123,5956846,S.

Methods: The study is based on the 2019 Macro-survey of Violence against Women conducted by the Spanish Ministry of Equality among a sample of 9568 women age 16 or more years. Odds Ratios were calculated and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: Forty-four women had suffered some kind of sexual violence over their lifetime, 9.2% had experienced PSV, 6.5% NPSV and 40.4% SH. More than 7% of women had been raped by a partner and 2.2% by another man. In the three groups, violence was associated with lower age and having a certified disability. NPSV and SH were significantly associated with a higher education and internet use. In NPSV, 9.2% of cases were reported to the police and 3.9% were reported to the courts. In SH, 91.7% of women told a family member or a close friend and 4.2% reported it to the police or the courts.

Yet, little is known about crime-specific recidivism. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between specific substance use and crime-specific recidivism. The study is based on 4207 Swedish prison clients with substance use assessed with Addiction Severity Index interviews between 2001 and 2006. Clients were followed for an average of 2.7 years. Risk factors for criminal recidivism were assessed with the Cox regression analysis. Sixty-eight percent of the clients returned to the criminal justice system. Apart from well-known risk factors such as male gender and young age, amphetamine, injection drug use, prior prosecution for violent and property crime, as well as homelessness and psychiatric problems, were risk factors for criminal recidivism. Sedatives and cannabis were, in this setting, negative risk factors for general recidivism. Age, heroin and injection drug use elevated the risks of recidivism to property and drug crime. Alcohol was associated with violent recidivism. When analysing different categories of crime separately, risk factors differed substantially.

126,"© 2022 The AuthorsGrowing evidence suggests that community-based interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can effectively address harmful social norms that promote or sustain gender inequality and drive violence against women (VAW). However, understanding what actions communities are already taking to address harmful social norms and prevent VAW is an essential first step for intervention development. Towards this goal, drawing on collective action theory, we conducted a realist analysis of secondary qualitative data collected with communities in India, Afghanistan, Peru and Rwanda. We coded interview and focus-group data from 232 participants to identify the contexts, mechanisms and outcomes (CMO) relevant for community action. We synthesized CMO configurations from each dataset into a conceptual framework composed of three middle-range theories of mechanisms driving community action to prevent VAW in LMICs. Our results highlight the importance of dedicated spaces for discussing VAW, VAW leaders as positive role models, and community perceptions of VAW as a problem worthy of intervention. In Rwanda and Peru, there was strong evidence to support the operation of these mechanisms. Contextual factors, including national and local policy and programmes targeting VAW, activated mechanisms that led to community action. In India and Afghanistan, evidence for the presence of these mechanisms was weaker, with social norms about women's position and violence being a private family matter preventing communities from addressing violence. Despite contextual differences, our data demonstrated communities in all four settings were somewhere along a pathway of change towards VAW prevention. This supports the need to build future prevention interventions on pre-existing mechanisms that trigger community action, rather than implementing existing interventions without local adaptation. Our conceptual framework serves as a tool for assessing these mechanisms of community action as part of intervention development research, centring community knowledge and fostering local ownership for more relevant and sustainable VAW prevention interventions.",2022-07-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,2,305,Mechanisms for community prevention of violence against women in low- and middle-income countries: A realist approach to a comparative analysis of qualitative data,1,true,10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115064,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2022.0,73.0,0.0,,126,1998001968,H.

128,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdBackground: One-quarter of homicide-suicide deaths in the U.S. are children. Filicide-suicide, a subset of homicide-suicide involving parent or caregiver perpetrators, is the most common form of homicide-suicide involving children. While these incidents have significant impacts, relatively few studies examine modifiable factors that contribute to these incidents. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify patterns of circumstances and contributing factors for filicide-suicide deaths, focusing on the individual and interpersonal differences between male and female perpetrators. Participants: This study utilized data from the National Violent Deaths Reporting System (NVDRS), which included 76 filicide-suicide incidents reported to NVDRS in 32 U.S. states between 2013 and 2015. Methods: We conducted a qualitative content analysis, which was grounded in the Marzuk, Tardiff, and Hirsch (1992) framework. We reviewed the filicide-suicide narratives and engaged in conversations about codes or themes that emerged for the filicide-suicide narratives. Additional codes were added as needed, and narratives were retroactively coded to ensure codes were consistently applied. Results: Relationship conflict and mental health issues were common among male and female perpetrators, but the manifestation of these factors differed greatly. For female perpetrators, relationship conflict, mental health issues, and children's chronic health issues commonly co-occurred. In contrast, relationship conflict, history of violence, and consequences of violence (e.g., legal issues, job problems) more commonly co-occurred among male perpetrators. Conclusion: Filicide-suicides are preventable acts of violence with numerous contributing factors.

In this paper we analyze baseline data from a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an HIV prevention intervention for GBMSM recruited from three cities (Atlanta, Detroit and New York City) to examine how the recent experience of IPV shapes their rankings of PrEP delivery options. Men were asked to rank from 1 to 8 PrEP taken by daily pill, event-based pill, injection, anal suppository (before sex), suppository (after sex), gel (penile or rectal) (before sex), and gel (after sex) and condoms. The analysis sample is 694 HIV-negative, sexually active GBMSM. Analysis considers an ordinal outcome measuring participant’s ranked preferences for their future use of eight HIV prevention options. Men who experienced physical IPV preferred PrEP in pill form, while men who experienced partners monitoring their behaviors (monitoring IPV) preferred PrEP by injection. Men who experienced emotional IPV ranked PrEP by pill lower than other methods. Sexual and controlling IPV were not significantly associated with PrEP modality ranking. As more modes of PrEP delivery become available, providers should be encouraged to screen GBMSM seeking PrEP for IPV, and to provide men with the necessary information to facilitate an informed choice when deciding on a PrEP modality that will work for them and their relationship context.",2022-07-01,Journal,Article,AIDS and Behavior,20153,1,26,"Intimate Partner Violence and Preferences for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Modes of Delivery Among A Sample of Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men",0,false,10.1007/s10461-022-03587-8,Springer,Aids and Behavior,2022.0,50.0,0.0,,129,1982163,R.

The additional stressors created by the need to stay home and socially isolate may act as triggers to intimate partner violence (IPV). In this article, we present data from a recent online cross-sectional survey with gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in the United States to illustrate changes in IPV risks that have occurred during the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. The Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 survey was conducted online from April to May 2020. GBMSM were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, recruiting a sample size of 696 GBMSM. Analysis considers changes in victimization and perpetration of IPV during the 3 months prior to the survey (March-May 2020) that represents the first 3 months of lockdown during the COVID-19 epidemic. During the period March-May 2020, 12.6% of participants reported experiencing any IPV with higher rates of emotional IPV (10.3%) than sexual (2.2%) or physical (1.8%) IPV.

133,"© 2021 SAGE Publications.Typological approaches in research of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) have been discussed on the basis of their validity and applicability in professional practice; yet most of the published studies on offender typologies are limited due to the use of relatively small, non-representative samples. The current study explored typologies of IPVAW perpetrators in a large-scale representative Spanish sample (n = 9,731 cases extracted from the Comprehensive Monitoring System of Gender-Based Violence Cases; VioGén System), according to classic batterer typologies proposed by Holtzworth-Munroe and Stuart (1994). To this end, the risk factors measured by the most extended Spanish police recidivism risk assessment tool (Valoración Policial del Riesgo; VPR) were used as clustering variables. Multiple correspondence analyses revealed the appropriateness of a bi-dimensional model to conceptualize IPVAW offender typologies. Our four-group solution may be described based on the levels of instability and antisociality of IPVAW offenders, as objectively measured by VPR5.0 risk indicators. Statistically significant differences between the IPVAW suggested typologies were found on all indicators, except for the presence of perpetrators younger than 24 years old and the presence of bidirectional intimate partner violence, which were equally distributed across the four groups. High instability/low antisociality (HiLa) and high instability/high antisociality (HiHa) individuals shared most risk indicators related to the aggressor’s psychological instability; whereas HiHa and low instability/high antisociality (LiHa) men endorsed more antisociality indicators than statistically expected. The low instability/low antisociality (LiLa) group was characterized by the less presence of VPR risk indicators. Although the four subtypes identified in our study resembled classic typologies, we propose a new subtype, with high levels of instability and antisociality (i.e., HiHa). This work contributes to existing knowledge of the heterogeneity of these men, by providing useful typologies that can help inform prevention and treatment.",2022-07-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,4,37,Male Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women: A Spanish Typology,0,false,10.1177/0886260521997442,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2020.0,60.0,0.0,,133,1390135083,J.

134,"© 2021 SAGE Publications.Transgender patients are at elevated risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), but national guidelines do not recommend routine screening for this population. This paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of routine IPV screening of transgender patients in a primary care setting by describing an existing screening program and identifying factors associated with referral and engagement in IPV-related care for transgender patients. An IPV “referral cascade” was created for 1,947 transgender primary care patients at an urban community health center who were screened for IPV between January 1, 2014 to May 31, 2016: (a) Of those screening positive, how many were referred? (b) Of those referred, how many engaged in IPV-specific care within 3 months? Logistic regression identified demographic correlates of referral and engagement. Of the 1,947 transgender patients screened for IPV, 227 screened positive. 110/227 (48.5%) were referred to either internal or external IPV-related services. Of those referred to on-site services, 65/103 (63.1%) had an IPV-related appointment within 3 months of a positive screen. IPV referral was associated with being assigned male at birth (AMAB) versus assigned female at birth (AFAB) (AOR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.52, 4.75) and with nonbinary, rather than binary, gender identity (AOR = 2.07, 95%CI 1.09, 3.73). Engagement in IPV-related services was not associated with any measured demographic characteristics. Similar to published rates for cisgender women, half of transgender patients with positive IPV screens received referrals and two-thirds of those referred engaged in IPV-specific care. These findings support routine IPV screening and referral for transgender patients in primary care settings. Provider training should focus on how to ensure referrals are made for all transgender patients who screen positive for IPV, regardless of gender identity, to ensure the benefits of screening accrue equally for all patients.",2022-07-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,1,37,Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Screening and Referral Outcomes among Transgender Patients in a Primary Care Setting,0,false,10.1177/0886260521997460,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2021.0,60.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Routine IPV screening and referral for transgender patients in primary care settings is supported and provider training should focus on how to ensure referrals are made for all transgender patients who screen positive for IPV, regardless of gender identity, to ensure the benefits of screening accrue equally for all patients.'}",134,2051555498,Kirsten Das,4232435,S.

Using campus climate data collected over 11 years, researchers explore stalking victimization with a particular focus on the experiences of sexual minority college students. To get a better understanding of stalking as experienced by this population, this study investigated descriptive qualities and prevalence of stalking victimization among college students to compare experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual individuals. Additionally, using a routine activities theory framework, this study explored multiple sexual minority identities as unique predictors of stalking victimization. Results showed that bisexual and pansexual women were significantly more likely to experience stalking than heterosexual women, and gay men were significantly more likely to experience stalking than heterosexual men. In samples that included heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and pansexual students, having a sexual minority identity predicted stalking victimization for men, and having a non-monosexual (bisexual or pansexual) identity predicted stalking victimization for women. When looking across all sexual orientations, sexual minority identity significantly predicted stalking victimization for both men and women.

They are the first persons that a woman encounters, and they determine whether her truth claim identifies her as domestic violence case, thereby enabling her to access State-provided services and interventions. Thus, it is important to inquire into the Desk officers’ worldviews and beliefs, also called schemas, and how these influence the ways they communicate and interact with the victim/survivors they encounter daily in their work. Guided by gender schema theory, this study examines the drawings of the VAW Desk officers—and the ecology of images that accompany these drawings—to delve into their cognitive constructions of the gendered nature of domestic violence.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The intentional homicide of female victims, which is most commonly perpetrated by intimate partners or family members, has been recognized in recent years as a matter of grave public concern that needs to be addressed from the cultural and judicial perspectives. To allow an in-depth criminological and psychopathological evaluation of female homicide in Italy in 2021 to be conducted, the authors performed a newspaper report analysis of the phenomenon. All female homicides that occurred in Italy in 2021 (n = 119) were included in the study. The analysis confirmed the low rate of female homicides in Italy when compared with other countries and also showed the phenomenon to be more complex than usually described. The highest rate of homicides was observed in elderly females when compared with other age groups, implying different criminological considerations and suggesting that gender-based violence may only explain some of the identified cases. The high incidence of suicide or attempted suicide among offenders, together with the high incidence of reported mental disorders in that population, suggests that a psychopathological perspective on the phenomenon of female homicide could help with the development and implementation of preventive strategies that focus on managing mental health at a territorial level and intervening in difficult domestic situations.",2022-06-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,Female Homicide in Italy in 2021: Different Criminological and Psychopathological Perspectives on the Phenomenon,1,true,10.3390/ijerph19127537,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,65.0,0.0,,141,3532134,C.

Recent reviews categorize a large number of norms-shifting programs but do not synthesize evidence about effectiveness. To inform the design of social and behavior-change programs in low-and middle-income countries in response to time-sensitive demands, this rapid systematic review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions that use norms-based approaches to change behavior. Nine indexes and eight websites were electronically searched for both systematic reviews and primary studies. Abstracts and full texts were screened to include: documents published in 2010 and later; documents evaluating the effectiveness of programs that include norms-based approaches; documents measuring behavioral outcomes; and documents employing quantitative analysis of concurrent treatment and comparison groups. Data collected include participant age cohort, program name and duration, scope of norms, intervention activities, category of behavioral outcome, and statement of findings for the main behavioral outcome(s). Primary studies were appraised based on identification strategy. Search and screening yielded 7 systematic reviews and 29 primary studies covering 28 programs. Across the primary studies, the programs are highly heterogeneous, and the findings are mixed, with some strong positive effects and many marginal or null effects on behavior change. Taken together, the evidence shows that meta-norms-based approaches can be part of effective programs but do not assure that programs will change behaviors.

The literature has established an association between institutional transformation and opportunities for gender policy change. It is clear that new actors and new rules are significant, but less is known about their interaction. Elinor Ostrom's concept of rules-in-use captures rules and their enactment in combination. Interviews with a new cadre of directly elected police and crime commissioners in England revealed the ways in which they worked with new institutional rules to prioritize violence against women and girls. Seven sets of rules are identified, arranged along a formal-informal continuum. Most were not specifically about gender but, when enacted by motivated, knowledgeable and reflexive actors, they facilitated gender policy change. A focus on micro-foundations enables the identification of institutional building blocks for gender policy change, highlighting the co-constitutive relationship between actors and rules.",2022-06-01,Journal,Article,Politics and Gender,5700166179,2,18,Identifying the Institutional Micro-Foundations of Gender Policy Change: A Case Study of Police Governance and Violence against Women and Girls,2,,10.1017/S1743923X20000586,Cambridge University Press,Politics & Gender,2021.0,42.0,0.0,,143,122415336,F.

The research aimed to assess whether the original one-dimensional model or a model containing both somatic and cognitive-emotional factors is appropriate in the case of a sample of university students. A repeated cross-sectional survey design based on convenience sampling was used to collect data from 677 university students from both public and private universities. The factor structure of the PHQ-9 was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Measurement invariances were assessed across gender, type of university, level of education and victim of domestic violence. Its convergent validity was determined by investigating its correlations with Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed excellent reliability of PHQ-9 as measured by both Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω. CFA suggested that a modified one-factor model where the error variances between item-3 (‘sleeping difficulties’) and item-6 (‘feeling as a failure’), item-6 and item-9 (‘suicidal thoughts’), item-4 (‘feeling tired’) and item-9, item-3 and item-9 were allowed to covary is appropriate for the sample. This model provided high values of comparative fit index (CFI), goodness of fit index (GFI), and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), low value of standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and a non-significant root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) as well as a high Factor Determinacy Score Coefficient. Correlation between PHQ-9 and GAD-7 was 0.751 and 0.934 between PHQ-9 and PHQ-ADS. Finally, the model is strictly invariant across gender and university type.

146,"© 2022Background: Sexual violence against women remains a global public health problem, with Southeast Asia having among the highest rates of violence victimization globally. Exposure to violence in adolescence–a highly prevalent experience in Vietnam–is associated with later perpetration of violence against others. However, childhood maltreatment as a latent construct is understudied, with most analyses focusing on theoretical categories, potentially missing key patterns of victimization, particularly poly-victimization. Poor understanding of these experience limits researchers’ ability to predict and intervene upon cyclical perpetration of violence. This study aims to identify latent classes of childhood maltreatment, and to test associations between class membership and sexually violent behavior during the first 12 months of university in a sample of Vietnamese men. Methods and findings: Heterosexual and bisexual men aged 18–24 matriculating into two universities in Hanoi were recruited for the randomized controlled trial of GlobalConsent, a six-module online sexual-violence prevention program. Participants (N = 793) completed a baseline survey, were randomized 1:1 to GlobalConsent or attention control, and were invited to complete post-test surveys at six-months post-baseline and 12-months post-baseline. Validated scales were employed to assess childhood maltreatment and past-six-month sexually violent behavior at each post-test. Latent class analysis identified four classes of childhood maltreatment: Limited-to-no, physical, physical and emotional, and poly-victimization. Associations between childhood maltreatment class and sexually violent behavior demonstrate a threshold effect, wherein poly-victimized men were significantly more likely than men in other classes to have engaged in sexually violent behavior during the 12-month follow-up period. Conclusions: There is a vital need for screening and intervention with men who have experienced childhood maltreatment in Vietnam to prevent future violence perpetration. Education is needed to break the cycle of violence intergenerationally and in romantic relationships by changing harmful norms around men's sexual privilege and the normalization of childhood maltreatment.",2022-06-01,Journal,Article,SSM - Population Health,21100443787,1,18,Childhood maltreatment class and sexually violent behavior among university men in Vietnam,1,true,10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101103,Elsevier Ltd,SSM - population health,2022.0,74.0,0.0,,146,36764828,K.

Methods: An in-depth analysis of articles published by the Geraldton Guardian in 2019 examined the nature of FV reporting. Analysis was based on deductive coding from existing literature and inductive identification of new themes. A comparative analysis examined articles from the Geraldton Guardian and Albany Advertiser over the same three-month period in 2015, 2017 and 2019 to analyse trends in FV reporting. Results: Of 135 articles analysed, there was alignment with five previously reported themes and two new themes were identified: FV as a public health issue; and community responses to reduce FV. Episodic framing was overwhelmingly associated with court reporting. There was more reporting of efforts at primary prevention of FV over time in both newspapers.

148,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Purpose of Review: While research has identified racial trauma in other contexts, it is often overlooked amongst Canadian society. Racial trauma occurs as a result of an event of racism or cumulative events over time whereby an individual experiences stress and consequent mental health sequelae. Given that the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and/or Person of Colour) population in Canada is increasing, it is imperative to identify racial discrimination and the subsequent stress and trauma associated with being racialized in Canada, which subjects BIPOC Canadians to various forms of racism, including microaggressions. Recent Findings: This paper reviews the published literature on racism and racial discrimination that identifies or infers racial trauma as the source of the mental health implications for various groups (e.g., Indigenous people, Black Canadians, Asian Canadians, immigrants, and refugees). In addition, intersectionality of racialized persons is prominent to their psychological well-being as their psychosocial and socioeconomic position are complex. Therefore, this paper both provides insight into the Canadian experience as a person of colour and signifies the need for further research on racial trauma in a Canadian context. Summary: Despite Canada’s emphasis on multiculturalism, racialized individuals are at risk for racial trauma due to prejudice and discrimination. The politicization of multiculturalism has permitted Canada to deny claims of racism, yet the historical basis of established institutions results in irrefutable systemic and systematic barriers for Canadian people of colour.",2022-06-01,Journal,Review,Current Trauma Reports,21100854825,6,8,The Traumatizing Impact of Racism in Canadians of Colour,1,true,10.1007/s40719-022-00225-5,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Current Trauma Reports,2022.0,134.0,0.0,,148,35137383,Monnica T.

There is even less known about the factors that shape HIV risk in male-male couples. Using data from Together Tomorrow, a study of partnered GBMSM in South Africa and Namibia, this study assessed the individual and dyadic correlates of three major HIV risk factors in this population: substance misuse, transactional sex, and depressive symptomatology. Data were collected during November 2016–March 2017 via a quantitative survey conducted with 140 partnered MSM (70 couples) in Windohoek, Keetmanshoop, Walvis Bay, and Swakopmund, Namibia and 300 partnered MSM (150 couples) in Pietermaritzburg and Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa for a total sample size of 440 partnered MSM (220 couples). Results of multilevel modeling analyses show several significant factors present in partnered GBMSM that differ from studies of single GBMSM, with intimate partner violence being a significant correlate across all three risk factors. Future interventions should consider dyadic approaches and integrate IPV prevention and mitigation efforts to reduce HIV in this population as part of a multisectoral approach.

A sample of 3,915 university students (70.8% female) completed the questionnaire. After an exploratory factor analysis, a confirmatory factor analysis tested the resulting four-factor structure of the Italian Subtle Rape Myth Acceptance (SRMA-IT) Scale (“She Asked for It”; “He Didn’t Mean To”; “It Wasn’t Really Rape”; and “She Lied”), consistent with McMahon and Farmer’s initial hypothesis. The Italian validation did not include items related to intoxication. Internal consistency of the subscales was good (α from.78 to.90). Convergent validity between all subscales and System Justification–Gender was detected: A strong relationship was observed (r is from.19 to.33; p <.001). The independent-sample T test then showed that women accepted all four rape myths significantly less than men: Effect size is more than moderate for the myth “She Asked for It” (Cohen’s d =.60) and between small and moderate for the other myths (d is from.35 to.42). Acceptance of rape myths is often associated with higher men’s proclivity to rape and with tendency to raped women’s double victimization (they can be not believed or blamed when they disclose the rape).

The purpose of this study was to examine whether sexual or physical assault before age 18 is associated with a heightened sense of being treated unfairly in early adulthood. A nationally representative sample of young adults age 18–21 (N = 2,770; 49% female) self-reported on whether they had ever been sexually or physically assaulted, whether it first occurred in childhood or adolescence, and how frequently they are treated unfairly in their everyday interactions with other people, as measured by the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS). Multivariate regression results indicated that child (≤age 12) physical assault and adolescent-onset (age 13–17) physical assault were associated with higher scores on the EDS for both men and women. Child sexual assault was associated with the EDS for men; adolescent-onset sexual assault was associated with the EDS for women. Violence as a minor was associated with each item of the EDS (e.g., treated with less respect, less courtesy, other people act of afraid of you, etc.).

152,"© 2020 SAGE Publications.Parent-to-child aggressive behavior is a common risk factor for children’s health. Gender is correlated also to the odds of using aggression and the odds of being a victim of aggression. Yet, only few studies have considered the constellation of perpetrator’s and victim’s gender as a factor of parental aggression. The current study addresses parent-to-child aggressive behavior while focusing on the constellation of perpetrator’s and victim’s gender (i.e., mother–daughter, mother–son, father–daughter, father–son). It utilizes a community sample of Israeli university students (N = 508), 78% of which are female, on average 25.67 years of age (SD = 8.29). The participants reported the incidence and frequency of verbal and physical aggressive behavior of their parents against them during the years of middle school. The results show gender and gender-constellation to be significantly correlated with parental aggression. Overall, sons were more likely to suffer both verbal and physical aggression from their parents than daughters were. Only paternal verbal and physical aggression was more common against daughters, and only maternal verbal and physical aggression was more common against sons. Parental verbal and physical aggression from both parents were more common against sons. For all types and forms of parental aggression, daughters reported higher frequencies. These results suggest that while parent’s gender might predict their overall aggressive behavior, and child’s gender might predict their overall odds to be victimized by parental aggression, gender-constellation might create gender-specific selective patterns of parental aggressive behavior. Thus, the theoretical contribution of this study is in emphasizing that gender-constellations have an explanatory value beyond gender alone. These findings might be valuable to assess the risk of daughters and sons to suffer parental aggression, and for practitioners to provide apt professional response.",2022-06-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,1,37,The Gender Perspective on Parent-to-child Aggression: Gender and Gender-constellations,0,false,10.1177/0886260520980379,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2020.0,94.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results show gender and gender-constellation to be significantly correlated with parental aggression, and sons were more likely to suffer both verbal and physical aggression from their parents than daughters were.'}",152,1485966483,David Mehlhausen-Hassoen,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,20.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Medicine, Psychology"

In this study, we analyze the effect of age on help-seeking behavior and the associated factors among women exposed to IPV in Spain. Using the Spanish Macrosurvey on Gender Violence of 2014, we analyzed the frequency of help-seeking behavior (police report, formal resources, and informal networks of support) in women who were exposed to lifetime physical/sexual or fear-based IPV (n = 1,567 women). We used Poisson regression models to obtain variables associated with support resources. The analysis was carried out in three age groups: young women (16–29 years old), adults (30–49 years old), and older women (50 years and over). Our results show that informal support networks are the most used resource by all women´s age groups. The probability of filing a police complaint increases among women exposured to physical IPV (PRadult : 1.58; &#x2028;PRelder : 2.17). The probability of using formal resources decreased among older women with low family socioeconomic status (PR: 0.80) and in adult women exposed to sexual IPV (PR: 0.78), and increased among young women and adult Spanish women (PRyoung: 1.65; PRadult: 1.34). The use of informal support networks increased among adult women with physical and mental health effects (PR: 1.22). In older women use of informal support networks was associated with the type of IPV (PRphysical: 1.14; PRsexual: 0.88).

154,"© Therence Nwana Dingana et al.Introduction: post-partum depression is one of the many challenges associated with childbirth. In Cameroon, the focus is more on post-partum obstetric complications resulting in underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of this condition. The current socio-political crisis plaguing the English-speaking part of Cameroon has increased the stressors that may inherently increase the prevalence. There is no published data describing post-partum depression in a rural setting in Cameroon. We seek to determine the prevalence and factors associated with PPD in women attending the Tubah District hospital, North West Region, Cameroon. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional hospital-based study at the Tubah District Hospital. A consecutive convenience sampling technique was used to recruit participants. Our main outcome was post-partum depression which was assessed using the Edinburgh Post-partum Depression Scale. Results: a total of 207 post-partum women took part in this study with a mean age of 27.54 ± 5.78 years. The prevalence of depression was 31.8%. Gender-based violence (OR: 4.67, P = 0.013), financial stress (OR: 3.57, P = 0.002) and male baby (OR: 2.83, P < 0.001) were independent psychosocial factors associated with PPD. Independent psycho-clinical factors of post-partum depression include family history of mental health illness (OR: 4.34, P = 0.04) and previous history of depression (OR: 4.17, P = 0.02).

Abuse increased the initial value of aggression in girls more than in boys, but reduced the increase rate of aggression over time in girls. Neglect increased the initial value of aggression only in boys. Consequently, abuse and neglect experienced during adolescence can affect depressive symptoms and aggression in the individual differently, depending on gender.

Objective: The present study addresses an important gap in the literature regarding the intergenerational cycle, investigating how perceived parenting style history predicts mothers' and fathers' child abuse risk across the transition to parenthood, with particular attention to the role of gender by comparing cross-gender and same-gender grandparent-parent dyads. Participants and methods: The sample is drawn from a four-wave longitudinal study that enrolled 203 families beginning the final trimester of mothers' pregnancy until children were four years old. Parents responded to measures on parenting style history received from both their mothers and fathers as well as measures of their own child abuse risk, parent-child aggression, and personal parenting style. Results: Mothers demonstrated more same-gender effects, whereas fathers demonstrated more cross-gender effects–both patterns supportive of a tendency to follow maternal influences when considering child abuse risk. With regards to behavior, both mothers' and fathers' reports of parent-children aggression were most influenced by perceived harsh parenting received from their fathers.

The results revealed that, on Twitter, it was stressed that the victim was a married woman with children who had practiced sexting. However, in response to this initial description, many voices also emerged that labelled this image-based abuse as gender-based online violence. Criticism was aimed at both the passivity of the company, and the attitude of hundreds of thousands of people who share the sexting video by WhatsApp groups without permission.

This article analyzes a database obtained from a survey on gender violence conducted by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research. The survey, prepared by the Government Delegation for Gender Violence, consisted of interviews with women aged over 15 years living in 858 municipalities distributed over 50 provinces in Spain. The data reveal that most of the women interviewed have not suffered any type of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse. Hence, the application of standard logistic methodologies which suppose symmetric responses, can lead to a poor specification of the model, a misinterpretation of marginal effects and unidentified predictors. It seems more appropriate to consider an asymmetric link function to explain the probability of abuse (physical, sexual, or psychological). The Bayesian methodology allows the incorporation of such an asymmetric function improving the specification of the model. In this article, we compare both methodologies and prove that Bayesian asymmetric performs better results by considering several diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, this methodology detects some significative factors that are not revealed by the classical method, e.g., the partner’s nationality for sexual abuse or the women’s total number of intimate partners for psychological abuse. Bayesian asymmetric estimations reveal no significance concerning to the lowest partner’s level of education for physical abuse but if the intimate partner is currently studying this reduces the probability of sexual abuse. The woman’s level of education is not relevant to the physical, sexual, or psychological abuses suffered. Therefore, the findings may help identify economic and sociological factors not previously considered in this area and highlight policies that may be adopted or revised to help overcome this social problem.",2022-05-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,1,37,Determinants of Gender-based Violence Against Women in Spain: An Asymmetric Bayesian Model,2,,10.1177/0886260520967749,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2020.0,32.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A database obtained from a survey on gender violence conducted by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research is analyzed to help identify economic and sociological factors not previously considered in this area and highlight policies that may be adopted or revised to help overcome this social problem.'}",161,1469307992,J.

There were five main findings from this study: (a) although research suggests ex-partner stalkers are the most threatening, assaultive, and harassing stalkers, particularly for women, this study shows that a significant number of acquaintance stalking victims experience high levels of fear, threats, life interference, and assault; (b) women had higher stalking-related fear levels and a greater belief that their stalker was capable of harming them regardless of stalker gender, while men stalked by females were least concerned about harm; (c) close to one-quarter of victims had one unknown background factor and one-third indicated not knowing about two or more background factors suggesting variation in the level of victim knowledge about acquaintance stalkers; (d) the number of threats, stalker history of violence to others, the belief that the stalker does not care about severe consequences, and a greater number of unknown stalker background factors were associated with higher stalking-related fear levels and an increased perception that the stalker was capable of harm; and, (e) higher concern about a significant life impact from the stalking was associated with forced confrontations, believing the stalker wanted revenge, victim vulnerability, proxy stalking, and technology facilitated stalking.

163,"© 2022 ACM.Trauma is the physical, emotional, or psychological harm caused by deeply distressing experiences. Research with communities that may experience high rates of trauma has shown that digital technologies can create or exacerbate traumatic experiences. Via three vignettes, we discuss how considering the possible effects of trauma and traumatic stress reactions provides an explanatory lens with new insights into people's technology experiences. Then, we present a framework - trauma-informed computing - in which we adapt and show how to apply six key principles of trauma-informed approaches to computing: safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, enablement, and intersectionality. Through specific examples, we describe how to apply trauma-informed computing in four areas of computing research and practice: user experience research & design, security & privacy, artificial intelligence & machine learning, and organizational culture in tech companies.

164,"© Objectives To investigate associations and potential pathways between women's lifetime exposure to traumatic events and their recent experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV). Setting South African informal settlements near Durban. Participants 677 women, living in informal settlements, aged 18-30 years, currently out of school or formal employment. Primary and secondary outcome measures Self-reported experiences of IPV in the past 12 months and exposure to traumatic neighbourhood events (including witnessing murder, being robbed or kidnapped, witnessing and experiencing rape). Results Exposure to traumatic events was common among the 677 women surveyed. Over 70% had experienced at least one in their lifetime; one quarter (24%) had experienced 3 or more different events. Women exposed to any traumatic event had a 43% increase in the odds of experiencing IPV in comparison to those with no exposure (aOR 1.43, p≤0.000). Exposure to non-partner rape is more strongly associated with IPV than any other traumatic experience. Pathways from exposure to traumatic events and non-partner rape to recent IPV experience are mediated by a latent variable of poor mental health. Food insecurity is associated with all forms of traumatic experience, and is also indirectly associated with IPV through views by women that are unsupportive of gender equality. Conclusions Women living in South African informal settlements who witness or experience traumatic events were likely to experience IPV, and this increases when women were exposed to multiple types of events. Our model suggests that experiencing traumatic events, and non-partner rape in particular, has negative effects on women's mental health in ways that may increase their vulnerability to IPV. IPV prevention interventions should consider the broader impacts of women's exposure to neighbourhood violence and severe poverty on IPV risk in settings where these are endemic.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Phnom Penh and three other provinces in Cambodia. Participants We recruited 600 FEWs from entertainment venues using a stratified random sampling method. Participants were eligible if they were at least 18 years old, working in the selected entertainment venues and self-identified as a FEW. Primary outcome measure Binge drinking was defined as drinking more than five units of alcoholic drinks in 24 hours on at least one occasion in the past 3 months. Results The prevalence of binge drinking was 76.7%. Adjusted odds of binge drinking were significantly higher among FEWs who earned >US$250 per month than those who earned ≤US$120 per month (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.96, 95% CI: 1.40 to 6.24), had been forced to drink more than once per month in the past 3 months than those who had never been forced to drink (AOR 5.66, 95% CI: 2.19 to 14.65), worked at karaoke bars than those working at a restaurants/café (AOR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.88) and experienced emotional abuse in the past 6 months than those who did not experience it (AOR 2.71, 95% CI: 1.22 to 6.02).

166,"© 2022 by The Regents of the University of California.In earlier work1 collaborative autoethnography was identified as a viable methodology for researching stories that drew on lived experiences with domestic abuse. Collaborative autoethnography offers a method of working with women outside of academia who have experienced gender-based violence (GBV) and including them as co-researchers whose writings can and should be valued as academic research. In this article, also a collaborative autoethnography, the authors explore methods for storying autobiographical experiences of GBV as a potential way of reclaiming stories whilst navigating the legal, ethical, and moral dilemmas sometimes associated with autobiographical writing that might help to make these stories less difficult to write, and also read, avoiding stereotypes that have led to critique around battle-weary narratives of GBV2 and bad romance tropes.3 The authors argue that evocative texts drawing on lived experiences but layering the real with the imaginary, the remembered with the fictitious, can be more accessible to read and write. Cook and Fonow4 argue that feminist work is often creative and spontaneous, and this article will detail writing methods that were shared by the authors in creative workshops with survivors of GBV as part of a project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC).5 They also share examples of their own stories that have been inspired by this approach as well as the challenges and motivations of working in this way.",2022-04-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Autoethnography,21101099969,0,3,Storying Autobiographical Experiences with Gender-Based Violence A Collaborative Autoethnography,2,,10.1525/joae.2022.3.2.129,University of California Press,Journal of Edugeography,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,166,98411334,Jessica Moriarty,1901392,M.

167,"Copyright © 2022 International Association of Forensic Nurses.BACKGROUND: Gender violence among adolescents is a global problem. In the context of public healthcare, nursing professionals play an important role. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine awareness, information, and beliefs regarding gender violence in adolescents and identify their educational needs. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data from a study conducted by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research and the Government Office for Gender Violence in 2013 are used. The sample contained 698 adolescents aged 15-19 years. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a data survey. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines are followed. Sociodemographic variables and seven topics of interest were analyzed: gender inequality, intimate relationships, definition of abuse, identification of abuse, awareness of cases of abuse in women, and informal and formal support networks. RESULTS: The results show that adolescents are well informed, are aware of informal and formal support networks, use the word ""respect,"" identify abuse and consider it unacceptable, and believe media coverage is useful in giving visibility to gender violence. No significant differences were found in gender, social class, or education, and their idea of romantic love remains intact. CONCLUSIONS: The researchers conclude that, in Spain, adolescents' awareness of gender violence is strongly influenced by environmental and cultural factors, because of the prevalence of gender and intimate partner violence in the country. Formal interventions such as health education provided by either nursing professionals in schools or the broader community can have a positive effect on adolescent health.

And yet, the evidence-base for the practice and delivery of distance counselling remains under-developed. In the context of COVID-19, where telehealth applications have undergone a rapid uptake, we undertook a scoping review of existing evidence of therapeutic and organizational practices related to the real-time (synchronous) delivery of distance counselling to survivors of SV.

169,"© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Alcohol use is coming under increasing scrutiny with respect to its health impacts on the body. In this vein, several high-income countries have issued low-risk drinking guidelines in the past decade, aiming to educate the public on safer levels of alcohol use. Research on the sex-specific health effects of alcohol has indicated higher damage with lower amounts of alcohol for females as well as overall sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol in male and female bodies. Research on gender-related factors, while culturally dependent, indicates increased susceptibility to sexual assault and intimate partner violence as well as more negative gender norms and stereotypes about alcohol use for women. Sex-and gender-specific guidelines have been issued in some coun-tries, suggesting lower amounts of alcohol consumption for women than men; however, in other countries, sex-and gender-blind advice has been issued. This article reports on a synthesis of the evidence on both sex-and gender-related factors affecting safer levels of drinking alcohol with an emphasis on women’s use.

170,"© 2022, Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. All rights reserved.Background: Some (minority) groups (MGs) are more vulnerable to sexual violence (SV) exposure than others. Othering-based stress (OBS) may mediate the relationship between minority identification and SV. This study aims to assess the prevalence of SV in different MGs to explore the relationship between minority identification and SV, to investigate whether belonging to multiple MGs moderates this relationship, and to explore OBS SV moderation for different MGs. Method: Through an online survey administered to a nationally representative sample in Belgium, data was collected from 4632 persons, of whom 21.01% self-identified as belonging to a MG (SI-Minority). SV prevalence was measured using behaviorally specific questions based on the WHO definition of SV. SI-Minority participants received an additional scale on OBS. Results: SI-Minority participants reported more SV victimization compared to the non-minorities. However, this increased risk was not moderated by minority identification but linked to the socio-demographic SV risk markers common to minority individuals. Multiple-minority participants were found more at risk of SV compared to single-minority respondents. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, pan-/omnisexual, asexual, and other non-heterosexual (LGB+) participants were found more at risk than heterosexual participants. OBS was found to be significantly correlated to SV in sexual and gender minorities and in cultural minorities. Conclusions: This study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between minority identification, OBS, and SV.

Methods We used data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 061 study conducted among BSMM and Black transgender women in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, restricting analyses to those who returned for the 6-month follow-up visit when recent incarceration was measured (n = 1169). Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, we measured associations between incarceration and next 6-month multiple partnerships; selling or buying sex; condomless anal intercourse; and incident chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV. We explored differences by study city, and among BSMM who had sex with men only, BSMM who had sex with men and women, and Black transgender women. Results Approximately 14% reported past 6-month incarceration. Incarceration was associated with next 6-month selling sex (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.87) in the overall sample and multiple partnerships among BSMM who had sex with men and women (ARR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.10-1.63) and transgender women (ARR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.22-2.57).

Despite the progress in access to water and sanitation in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), women and girls are vulnerable to various forms of violence when meeting their water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) needs. The findings on WaSH related gender-based violence (GBV) in LMICs are fragmented, and thus may not be able to inform policies and interventions aimed at addressing vulnerabilities to WaSH related violence. This scoping review characterizes forms of WaSH related violence against women in LMICs. A review of 29 peer-reviewed papers emerging from a search in Scopus, Medline, Embase and Web of Science reveals four dimensions of WaSH-GBV: structural, physical, psychological and sexual. We observed that gender norms reproduce power relations that intersect with drivers of inequities, social exclusion and marginalization to shape patterns of violence. Based on these findings, we propose a conceptual framework showcasing how contextual factors produce and reinforce WaSH related gender-based violence. We reflect on the implications of these findings for policy and suggest the need for WaSH practitioners and researchers to evaluate and measure WaSH access beyond the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) service ladder.

173,"© 2021Background: Relatively few maltreated children receive mental health services, despite the importance of treatment in combating the deleterious impact of maltreatment. Characteristics of the child, caregiver, and family have been investigated in relation to caregiver's help seeking behavior for children's psychological difficulties; yet, these associations have been inconsistent, and are very understudied among younger maltreated children. Other aspects of the child's environment, such as father involvement, negative life events, and neighborhood risk and satisfaction have not been examined. It is also uncertain how cumulative maltreatment and the specific forms of maltreatment - sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, neglect, and domestic violence, are associated with mental health consultation. Objective: The aim of the current study was to utilize an ecological model that included child, caregiver, family, neighborhood, and maltreatment factors to better understand caregiver's help seeking behavior. Participants/setting/method: The study relied upon 448 six-year-old maltreated children (47.5% male; 48.7% Black) from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) study. Results: Several factors, including child's gender and externalizing symptoms, and caregiver educational attainment and depression and were associated with mental health consultation. Cumulative maltreatment, however, was unrelated. When the specific forms of maltreatment were included, none of the individual maltreatment types were tied to help seeking behavior. Conclusions: Child and caregiver factors, such as child's level of behavioral challenges as caregiver's level of education and depression, may contribute to decisions regarding seeking services for young, maltreated children.

174,"© 2021 International Society for Sexual MedicineBackground: Lesbophobia and biphobia are manifestations of homophobic violence directed at lesbian and bisexual women that results in daily violation of rights and social exclusion. Aim: To describe experiences of the violence against lesbian and bisexual women in Brazil. Methods: Sequential mixed methods study was carried out in 2 stages. In the first one, quantitative, an electronic questionnaire was applied to women from all regions, with questions about sociodemographic characteristics, self-identification and lesbophobic and biphobic events. In the second one, qualitative, lesbian, and bisexual women were interviewed face to face about the violence suffered. Outcomes: The chi-square test was applied to compare violence against lesbian and bisexual women (type of violence, place of aggression, gender and age range of the aggressor, bond with the aggressor, repetition of violence, and denunciation of violence) and the content analysis for qualitative data (main categories of analysis were events of violence, denunciation, and consequences of violence). Results: The report of violence was present in 65% of the answers. There was a predominance of psychological violence (39.8%), in the public environment (63%), practiced by men (73.2%), by strangers (66.2%) and repeatedly (82%). Lesbian women, compared to bisexuals, were more prone to violence in the public environment (59.5% vs 39.5%) and with repetition (84.3% vs 60.6%). The narratives explained intimidating experiences in the family environment (insults, threat of suicide or homicide and false imprisonment) and public (harassment, beatings, and rape). Discriminatory attitudes, insults, and refusal of service in restaurants and bars were recurrent. Clinical Implications: The data provide information that can serve to improve policy initiatives to reduce these episodes. Strengths and Limitations: This is the first study of mixed methods, with national coverage, on lesbophobia and biphobia events in Brazil. Future studies should include women underrepresented in this research as trans women, non-white, less educated, and from the most distant regions of the country.

175,"© 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.Objectives: To describe the imaging findings of intimate partner violence (IPV)–related injury and to evaluate the role of longitudinal imaging review in detecting IPV. Methods: Radiology studies were reviewed in chronological order and IPV-related injuries were recorded among 400 victims of any type of abuse (group 1) and 288 of physical abuse (group 2) from January 2013 to June 2018. The likelihood of IPV was assessed as low/moderate/high based on the review of (1) current and prior anatomically related studies only and (2) longitudinal imaging history consisting of all prior studies. The first radiological study date with moderate/high suspicion was compared to the self-reported date by the victim. Results: A total of 135 victims (33.8%) in group 1 and 144 victims (50%) in group 2 demonstrated IPV-related injuries. Musculoskeletal injury was most common (58.2% and 44.5% in groups 1 and 2, respectively; most commonly lower/upper extremity fractures), followed by neurologic injury (20.9% and 32.9% in groups 1 and 2, respectively; most commonly facial injury). With longitudinal imaging history, radiologists were able to identify IPV in 31% of group 1 and 46.5% of group 2 patients. Amongst these patients, earlier identification by radiologists was provided compared to the self-reported date in 62.3% of group 1 (median, 64 months) and in 52.6% of group 2 (median, 69.3 months). Conclusions: Musculoskeletal and neurological injuries were the most common IPV-related injuries. Knowledge of common injuries and longitudinal imaging history may help IPV identification when victims are not forthcoming. Key Points: • Musculoskeletal injuries were the most common type of IPV-related injury, followed by neurological injuries. • With longitudinal imaging history, radiologists were able to better raise the suspicion of IPV compared to the selective review of anatomically related studies only. • With longitudinal imaging history, radiologists were able to identify IPV earlier than the self-reported date by a median of 64 months in any type of abuse, and a median of 69.3 months in physical abuse.",2022-04-01,Journal,Note,European Radiology,16687,2,32,Longitudinal imaging history in early identification of intimate partner violence,2,,10.1007/s00330-021-08362-2,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,European Radiology,2021.0,33.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'With longitudinal imaging history, radiologists were able to better raise the suspicion of IPV compared to the selective review of anatomically related studies only and to help IPV identification when victims are not forthcoming.'}",175,46904371,Hyesun Park,6604731,Rahul Gujrathi,4000824,B.

177,"© 2021 L'Encéphale, ParisBackground: The prevention of Physical Violent Behavior (VB) toward others during psychiatric hospitalization is a major concern of clinicians. These VBs can have a deleterious impact on the victims, inpatients or caregivers, as well as on the therapeutic milieu. Such violence can also have negative consequences for the assailant patients, such as repeatedly being hospitalized under restraint, stigmatization, and difficulties reintegrating into the community. Objectives: This study explored individual (age, gender, marital status, living status, diagnostic) and institutional (type of admission, length of stay, number of previous hospitalizations) risk factors, and how their interactions could increase the risk of VB during psychiatric hospitalizations. Method: The study was carried out over a period of four years in the psychiatry department of the Lausanne University Hospital, on the 15 wards (219 beds) specialized in acute psychiatric care for adults. All the patients admitted to one of these wards during this period (n = 4518), aged between 18 and 65 years, were included in the study. The sample was divided in two groups: non-violent patients (NVPs) and violent patients (VPs). VBs, defined as physical aggressions against another person, were assessed by the Staff Observation Aggression Scale – Revised (SOAS – R). Only physical assaults, associated or not with other types of violence, involving hospitalized patients were analyzed. Personal and institutional factors were extracted from the hospital database. Chi2 independence tests were used to assess differences between groups. Logistic regression models were used to identify the links between each factor and the VB. Classification and regression trees were used to study the hierarchical effect of factors, and combinations of factors, on VBs. Results: During the study period, 414 VBs were reported involving 199 patients (4.40 % of all patients). VPs were significantly younger, male, more likely to be unmarried and living in sheltered housing before hospitalization. In this group, the proportion of patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia, and/or schizophrenia with comorbid substance abuse and cognitive impairment, were higher compared to NVPs. VPs were more frequently admitted involuntarily, had a longer average length of stay and a greater number of previous hospitalizations. The logistic regression model performed on individual factors have shown a significant link between age (OR = 0.99; CI: 0.97–1.00; P-value = 0.024), living in sheltered housing before admission (OR = 2.46; CI: 1.61–3.75; P-value < 0.000), schizophrenic disorders (OR = 2.18; CI: 1.35–3.57; P-value = 0.001), schizophrenic disorders with substance abuse comorbidity (OR = 2.00; CI: 1.16–3.37; P-value = 0.016), cognitive impairment (OR = 3.41; CI: 1,21–8.25; P-value = 0.010), and VBs. The logistic regression model on institutional factors have shown a significant link between involuntary hospitalization (OR = 4.38; CI: 3.20–6.08; P-value < 0.000), length of previous stay (OR = 1.01; CI: 1.00–1.01; P-value < 0.000), number of previous hospitalizations (OR = 1.06; CI: 1.00–1.12; P-value = 0.031), and VBs. The logistic regression model on individual and institutional factors have shown a significant link between age (OR = 0.99; CI: 0.97–1.00; P-value = 0.008), living in sheltered housing before admission (OR = 2.46: CI: 1.61–3.75; P-value = 0.034), cognitive impairment (OR = 3.41; CI: 1.21–8.25; P-value = 0.074), involuntary hospitalization (OR = 3.46; CI: 2.48–4.87; P-value < 0.000), length of previous stay (OR = 1.01; CI: 1.00–1.01; P-value < 0.000), and VBs. The classification and regression trees have shown that the relationship between long length of stay and repeated hospitalizations mainly potentiate the risk of violence. Conclusion: The results of this study have shown the existence of a small group of vulnerable patients who accumulate constrained hospital stays during which violence occurs. Exploring the clinical profiles and institutional pathways of patients could help to better identify these patients and promote a more appropriate mode of support, such as intensive clinical case management. This model could facilitate the development of a clinical network and the links between the structures and partners caring for a patient.

Understanding cognitive risk markers is theoretically important and can inform intervention to maximize the chance of behavior change. The current article investigated cognition regarding general antisociality, relationships, and gender-role attitudes on youth IPA perpetration among 275 (123 female) 14- to 18-year-olds. Theoretically derived relationships (based on social information processing theory and the General Aggression Model) were hypothesized, which furthered understanding of how cognition contributes to relationship aggression in adolescents, while controlling for common behavioral correlates. Results showed that, overall, other experiences of aggressive behavior more strongly related to youth IPA perpetration than cognitive correlates. Among boys, general antisocial cognition was more strongly associated with youth IPA perpetration than relationship-specific cognition, with the reverse being true for girls.

This review used rigorous methods to locate and synthesize literature that described explanatory theories of IPH perpetration. Using set search terms, we systematically searched 15 databases and repositories for theory-focused documents (i.e., theory papers or analyses) published in English from 2003 to 2018. Eighteen documents met these inclusion criteria and identified 22 individual theories that seek to explain why people might kill their intimate partners. These theories fell within four broader theoretical perspectives: feminist, evolutionary, sociological/criminological, and combined. Key tenets and focal populations of these 22 theories were identified and organized into a compendium of explanatory theories of IPH perpetration. Potential strengths and limitations of each of the four perspectives were described. Review findings underscored the likely importance of addressing gender as well as risk and protective factors at all levels of the social ecological model in efforts to understand IPH perpetration. The review findings highlighted the need for both integrated theories and a broader conceptual organizing framework to guide work aimed at IPH perpetration prevention to leverage the strengths of disparate theoretical perspectives.

180,"© The Author(s) 2020.Gendered models of abuse describe intimate partner violence (IPV) as unilaterally perpetrated by dominant, aggressive men toward vulnerable women. This unidirectional conceptualization has contributed to a “domestic violence stereotype” which, alongside broader attitudes regarding gender, influences attitudes toward “non-typical” victim and perpetrator groups (e.g., male victims, female perpetrators, those within same-sex relationships), and has significant outcomes for help-seeking decision-making, as well as responses from service providers and the criminal justice system. While prevalence data and research suggest bidirectional violence is in fact the most common pattern, there is still little known about how the stereotypes and attitudes described above manifest in scenarios where both parties occupy “victim” and “perpetrator” labels. The present pilot study therefore asked 178 undergraduate students to allocate “victim” and “perpetrator” labels, and make judgments of severity, resolution, and justice outcomes, toward hypothetical opposite-sex IPV scenarios varying on the proportion of abuse perpetrated by each party, and type of violence. Results showed that participants were infrequently labelled men as “victims,” and women as “perpetrators,” across scenarios. They were also less likely to recommend that the man should call the police. These exploratory results suggest that powerful stereotypes about IPV and gender may serve to influence perceptions of bidirectional violence and point to a need to study this issue in more detail to elucidate the most appropriate way to begin to address these issues.",2022-04-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,5,37,"But, Who Is the Victim Here?

We conducted independent samples t test between Muslims and Christians. We conducted hierarchical regression analyses using the Christian minority subsample to see if intersected discrimination is predictive of COVID-19 hospitalization. We conducted two-path analyses, one with intersected discrimination as an independent variable and the second with the different discrimination types as independent variables. Intersected discrimination predicted COVID-19 hospitalization. The primary discrimination type for Christians was genocidal discrimination. Christians had higher existential anxiety about status and death than Muslims. Intersected discrimination and discrimination types had a significant association with mental health, health, and cognition variables, with intersected discrimination, had a higher impact than each. Existential anxiety about the person’s social and economic status was the critical outcome of intersected discrimination that trickles down to other variables.

182,"Copyright © 2022, Author(s).Background: Aggressive behavior of patients in psychiatric wards is one of the main challenges faced by healthcare workers. Despite the abundance of research on the frequency of aggressive behavior, not enough attention has been paid to its severity. Furthermore, limited studies have evaluated the restraint methods used to manage aggressive behaviors. Objectives: The current descriptive study aimed to compare the relationship between demographic characteristics, diagnosis of psychiatric illness, medical illness, and hospitalization characteristics with features of aggressive behavior in patients experiencing different types of restraint during hospitalization. Methods: We evaluated subjects admitted to the adult psychiatric wards of Imam Hossein and Taleghani hospitals in Tehran, Iran, in 2018. The patients were controlled by various restraint methods during hospitalization. All the patients were evaluated for the severity of aggression, which was determined utilizing the Persian version of the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS). All the data along with demographic and clinical characteristics obtained from medical records were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test (P-value = 0.05) and Spearman correlation coefficient to describe the factors affecting the aggressive behavior of patients. Results: In this study, the prevalence of aggressive behavior was 11.7%. Among the demographic variables, gender (P-value = 0.003), education level (P-value = 0.05), and the history of aggressive behavior (P-value = 0.001) were significantly associated with the MOAS. Furthermore, as the hospitalization duration increased, the frequency of aggressive behavior decreased, and its severity intensified. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between aggression severity with admission type (P-value = 0.00), concurrent medical illness (P-value = 0.026), and substance abuse (P-value = 0.025).

Among women living with HIV, there is a dearth of longitudinal information regarding dynamics of sex work engagement and associated social and health outcomes. In order to better understand the social contexts and health needs of sex working women living with HIV, this study aimed to understand recent sex work prevalence and its longitudinal associations with stigma, psychosocial and clinical HIV outcomes among women living with HIV in Canada. Methods: We conducted a three-wave prospective cohort survey at 18-month intervals with women living with HIV aged 16 and older in three Canadian provinces between 2013 and 2018. We used generalized estimating equations to examine longitudinal associations between recent (past 6-month) sex work with three types of outcomes: psychosocial (recent violence, recent injection drug use, hazardous alcohol use, clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder), clinical HIV (CD4 count and viral load) and stigma (HIV-related stigma, racial discrimination and gender discrimination). Equations were adjusted for socio-demographic factors associated with sex work across all three waves: province, age, income, gender identity, sexual orientation, education level, ethnicity and housing security. Results and Discussion: Of 1422 participants, 129 (9.1%) reported recent sex work during at least one wave (82 at baseline, 73 at first follow-up and 32 at second follow-up). In adjusted analyses, recent sex work was associated with psychosocial outcomes, including: past 3-month violence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.70, 3.60), past 6-month injection drug use (AOR = 3.49, 95% CI = 2.21–5.52), hazardous alcohol use (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.04–3.89) and depression (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.06–2.15). In unadjusted analyses, sex work was also associated with clinical HIV outcomes and gender discrimination, but not racial discrimination/HIV-related stigma. Conclusions: Among women living with HIV in Canada, sex work engagement is dynamic, and sex workers are more likely to report recent violence, recent injection drug use, problematic alcohol use and clinical depression. Violence prevention and support, harm reduction, mental health promotion and sex work-affirming programs could be employed to optimize health and rights for sex working women living with HIV.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of the International AIDS Society,19700175037,0,25,Recent sex work and associations with psychosocial outcomes among women living with HIV: findings from a longitudinal Canadian cohort study,1,true,10.1002/jia2.25874,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Journal of the International AIDS Society,2022.0,53.0,0.0,,183,3884508,C.

This study assesses the impact of Domestic Violence Report and Referral (DVRR), a digital mandatory reporting compliance system with integrated direct-to-advocacy referrals sent with patient consent, on survivors' likelihood of receiving advocacy by race/ethnicity and gender. Methods We assessed ED charts between 2014-2018 in an urban, Level 1 trauma center for DVrelated positive screening, chief concern, or documentation in medical/social work notes. We matched these visits by name to local DV advocacy agency records. Using logistic regression, we assessed survivor odds of reaching advocacy by DVRR receipt, race/ethnicity and gender. We used predicted probabilities to identify between-group differences in advocacy services received. Results Of the 1366 visits, 740 received the DVRR intervention; 323 received advocacy services Without DVRR, compared to white, female survivors (n = 87), male survivors (n = 132) had 0.20 (95% CI: 0.07-0.56) times the odds of reaching advocacy compared to female survivors; Latinx survivors (n = 136) had 2.53 (95% CI: 1.58-4.07) times the odds of reaching advocacy compared to white survivors. With DVRR, the odds and predicted probabilities of reaching advocacy increased significantly for all survivors. White, female survivors (n = 74) who received DVRR experienced 2.60 (95% CI: 1.66-4.07) times the odds of connecting with advocacy. Compared to this reference group, Black survivors (n = 480) who received DVRR experienced 4.66 additional times the odds of reaching advocacy services (95% CI: 3.09-7.04) and male survivors (n = 84) experienced 8.96 additional times the odds (95% CI: 2.81-28.56). Overall, we predict 43% (95% CI: 38-53%) of Latinx survivors (n = 177), 36% (95% CI: 31-40%) of Black survivors (n = 480) and 23% (95% CI: 14-32%) of white survivors (n = 83); 37% (95% CI: 33-40%) of women (n = 656) and 29% (95% CI: 18-42%) of men (n = 84) received advocacy services with DVRR.

Materials and methods: This study used the outpatient, emergency, and hospitalization data of 2 million people in the National Health Insurance sample from 2000 to 2015. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic N-codes 995.5 (child abuse) and 995.8 (adult abuse) or E-codes E960–E969 (homicide and intentional injury by others) were defined as the case study for this study, and the risks of first violent injury for boys and girls (0–17 years old), adults (18–64 years old), and elders (over 65 years old) were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used for risk comparison. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: The proportion of women (12–17.9 years old) who were sexually assaulted was 2.71 times that of women under the age of 12, and the risk of sexual assault for girls and adult women was 100 times that of men. Girls who were insured as labor insurance, farmers, members of water conservancy and fishery associations, low-income households, and community insured population (public insurance as the reference group) were significantly more likely to seek medical treatment from sexual assault than adult women. Among them, the risk was greatest for girls from low-income households (odds ratio = 10.74). Conclusion: Women are at higher risk of sexual assault than men regardless of whether they are children or adults, and the highest risk is for women in senior high schools, especially for girls from low-income households. Therefore, the protection of women’s personal autonomy is the direction that the government and people from all walks of life need to continue to strive for. Especially for high school students from low-income households, protection must be strengthened through education, social work, and police administration.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,0,19,Sexual Assault Is the Biggest Risk Factor for Violence against Women in Taiwan—A Nationwide Population Cohort Study from 2000 to 2015,1,true,10.3390/ijerph19063473,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,45.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Women are at higher risk of sexual assault than men regardless of whether they are children or adults, and the highest risk is for women in senior high schools, especially for girls from low-income households.'}",186,15742575,Miao-Ju Chwo,2051711049,Shi-Hao Huang,2108679060,Yao-Ching Huang,2047456096,Iau-Jin Lin,4586511,Chia-Peng Yu,90564100,C.

Baseline and follow-up self-administered survey data were examined from Los Angeles County participants' ages 18-45 years at enrollment who were either HIV negative or living with HIV, but recruited to over represent men who used drugs and men with unsuppressed HIV infection. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to identify predictors of baseline incarceration history and of incident incarceration over study follow-up among 440 and 338 participants, respectively. Older age, Black race, low socioeconomic status, homelessness, stimulant use, and depression symptoms were associated with baseline incarceration history. The only SGM-related factor associated with baseline incarceration history was having experienced violence based on sexual orientation identity. Just one statistically significant, independent positive predictor of incident incarceration was identified: prior incarceration, whereas having four or more friends that could lend money was a statistically significant protective factor against incident incarceration. Fundamental Cause Theory provides a useful framework to explain identified predictors of incarceration. Addressing poverty, housing instability, inadequate access to health care, and their root causes is critical to reducing incarceration rates in this population, as is expanded access to both diversion and anti-recidivism programs and to evidence-based treatment for stimulant use disorders.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,17,Factors predicting incarceration history and incidence among Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) residing in a major urban center,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0265034,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2022.0,56.0,0.0,,187,4548426,N.

Given the anticipated growth of this age demographic, addressing violence will become even more imperative and better solutions needed. Recent Findings: A PubMed search of the literature was performed to identify relevant articles addressing violence in the elderly. The search was limited to articles published within the last 10 years, with greater emphasis on those written within the past 5 years. Whether it be self-directed, perpetrated by older adults against others, or specifically directed towards older adults, violence in the elderly carries with it many negative repercussions. Among the factors reportedly associated with elder abuse are age, female gender, lower socioeconomic status, marital status, location of residence, and health status.

189,"© 2022 The Author(s)Background: Victimization is highly prevalent in individuals with mild intellectual disability (MID) or borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) and is an important risk factor for mental health problems and violent behavior. Not much is known, however, about victimization history in women with MID-BIF admitted to forensic mental health care. Aims: The aim of this multicenter study is to gain insight into victimization histories and mental health problems of female forensic psychiatric patients with MID-BIF. Methods: File data were analyzed of 126 women with MID-BIF who have been admitted to one of five Dutch forensic psychiatric hospitals between 1990 and 2014 and compared to data of 76 female patients with average or above intellectual functioning and to a matched sample of 31 male patients with MID-BIF. Results: All forensic patients had high rates of victimization, but women with MID-BIF showed an even higher prevalence of victimization during both childhood and adulthood and more complex psychopathology compared to female patients without MID-BIF. Compared to male forensic patients with MID-BIF, women with MID-BIF were more often victim of sexual abuse during childhood. During adulthood, the victimization rate in these women was more than three times higher than in men.

However, when treatments for male IPV perpetrators that address alcohol consumption are evaluated, the results are varied. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to assess the differential long-term effectiveness of a standard individual treatment programme for male IPV perpetrators depending on the presence of PAU. Methods: The sample was composed of 641 male IPV perpetrators who completed a specialized individual treatment programme for gender violence perpetrators. All of the participants were followed for one year after treatment completion. Results: The effects of PAU on treatment success were evaluated by means of multiple logistic regression analyses. The full model was reliable (χ2 = 10.243; df = 3; p = .016), and overall, 88.8% of the predictions were accurate. The findings indicated that the probability of successful treatment does not depend on the presence of PAU.

192,"© 2021 The AuthorsIntimate Partner Violence (IPV) has been linked to difficulties in socio-affective functions. Nevertheless, the underlying psychobiological mechanisms that might be responsible for them remain unclear. Oxytocin (OXT) stands out as an important hormone that may favor the salience of social information, due to its relevance in empathy and prosocial behavior. Thus, the study of salivary OXT (sOXT) may provide further information about potential impairments in social cognition in IPV perpetrators. This study analyzed the effects of an empathic induction task, performed through negative emotion-eliciting videos, on endogenous sOXT levels, mood state, and emotional perception in 30 IPV perpetrators compared to 32 controls. Additionally, we explored their performance on prosocial behavior after the empathic induction task, using Hare's donation procedure. Lower sOXT levels were found in IPV perpetrators after the task compared to controls, along with a general decreasing tendency in their sOXT levels. Additionally, IPV perpetrators exhibited no change in their mood state and perceived others' emotions as more positive and less intense. Moreover, the mood state response and alexithymia traits, respectively, positively and negatively predicted the sOXT levels after the empathic induction task in the entire sample. Finally, we did not observe a lower appearance of prosocial behaviors in IPV perpetrators; however, higher sOXT levels after the empathic induction task were found in subjects who donated when considering the whole sample. In sum, IPV perpetrators exhibited differences in their sOXT levels when empathizing, compared to controls, with alexithymia and the emotional response potentially explaining the sOXT levels after the task. Furthermore, prosocial behavior was more related to these sOXT levels than to IPV. As our knowledge about the emotional processing of IPV perpetrators increases, we will be better able to develop and include coadjutant treatments in current psychotherapeutic programs, in order to focus on their emotional needs, which, in turn, would reduce the future risk of recidivism.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Psychoneuroendocrinology,18745,2,137,Reduced salivary oxytocin after an empathic induction task in Intimate Partner Violence perpetrators: Importance of socio-affective functions and its impact on prosocial behavior,1,true,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105644,Elsevier Ltd,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2021.0,77.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'IPV perpetrators exhibited differences in their sOXT levels when empathizing, compared to controls, with alexithymia and the emotional response potentially explaining the sOxt levels after the task.'}",192,2113157674,J.

194,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This work focuses on lessons about habitus violence can teach and on implications of habitus-based action for understanding violence. A habitus model of violence partially explains not only group differences but also individual and within-individual variation in violence participation. In this model, experience with violence provides persons with embodied institutional competences to respond with violence should they perceive a situation as calling for it. Because violent institutional practices, principles, and relations are not necessarily incorporated into habitus simultaneously—as they rely on different memory systems—the habitus concept can be dissected. A typology of habitus elements corresponding to different institutional elements is developed distinguishing behavioral templates, moral templates, and relational templates from one another. Habitus fragmentation allows cross-institutional transfer of habitus elements dependent on nondeclarative memory. The case of gender-based violence and political violence illustrates how habitus elements developed in one institutional environment can direct action in a different institutional context calling for taking gender seriously in politics on theoretical grounds. As an embodied structure produced by involvement in multiple institutional domains and comprising transferable embodied institutional competences, habitus is a mechanism linking the so-called ‘private’ spheres of family and gender relations and the ‘public’ sphere of politics.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour,15367,0,52,"Institutionalized behavior, morality and domination: A Habitus in action model of violence",0,false,10.1111/jtsb.12292,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,2021.0,65.0,0.0,,194,117205305,Ana Velitchkova,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,21.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology

The present study focused on understanding whether college students’ preformed attitudes and beliefs were associated with the severity of sanctions they applied across a range of sexual assault cases as well as their assignments of guilt and responsibility to the parties involved. To determine students’ attitudes and beliefs mediating effects on sanction choices, five scales (i.e., rape myth acceptance, downplaying the severity of rape, sexism, just world beliefs, and right-wing authoritarianism) were adapted and used for this project. College students (n = 846) responded to one of four versions of a randomly distributed survey each containing eight vignettes varied to represent levels of 14 factors employed because of their relevance to campus sexual assault cases. Across all versions, sexism was associated with increased responsibility given to the victim. In addition, stronger endorsement of both downplaying significance of rape and rape myth acceptance scales were associated with giving a milder sanction to the perpetrator and increased responsibility and guilt assigned to the victim. Just world beliefs and right-wing authoritarianism associations were inconsistent across the four versions, suggesting these beliefs were situation-specific.

IPV affects both genders, though little is known about its effects on men as victims. The aims of this study were to determine if IPV is a factor contributing to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity independently of deployment-related trauma, and to determine if there are gender differences in these associations. Participants were 46 female and 471 male post-9/11 veterans. Four sequential regressions were employed to examine the independent contribution of IPV among multiple trauma types on PTSD severity in men and women at two epochs, post-deployment (participants were anchored to deployment-related PTSD symptoms) and current (within the past month). Models were significant for both epochs in men (ps <.001) but not in women (ps >.230). In men, IPV independently predicted PTSD severity in both epochs (β >.093). However, in women, early life trauma (β =.284), but not IPV was a significant and independent predictor for current PTSD. Thus, there are distinct gender differences in how trauma type contributes to PTSD symptom severity. Although the statistical models were not significant in women, we observed similar patterns of results as in men and, in some cases, the β was actually higher in women than in men, suggesting a lack of power in our analyses.

199,"© The Author(s) 2020.While substantial research has been conducted on intimate partner violence (IPV), comparatively little research has examined peoples’ perceptions of which behaviors comprise this form of abuse. Early identification of IPV is critical to ending abuse, however, forms of IPV that typically occur earlier in a relationship (e.g., nonphysical abuse) may not be core components of peoples’ mental frameworks (schemas) of IPV and may therefore be less commonly identified as abusive. To explore this, in Study 1 participants from an Australian University (N = 86) separately described the relationships with IPV and nonphysical IPV. Analyses identified control, power imbalance, stereotypical gender dynamics (male perpetrator, female victim), physical abuse, and having a low socioeconomic status abuser as common components of participants’ IPV schema when not prompted with type of abuse. However, participants largely failed to describe nonphysical IPV behaviors, suggesting limited awareness of the specific behaviors that constitute abuse. To explore this in Study 2, participants from an Australian University (N = 305) were asked to categorize a range of specific behaviors (including physically abusive, nonphysically abusive, and nonabusive behaviors) as definitely, maybe, or never abusive. Drawing on the known positive association between gender and romantic beliefs with the experience of abuse, we also assessed the relationship of identification of IPV behaviors to these beliefs. Moderated multilevel modeling showed that nonphysical IPV behaviors were generally perceived as less abusive than physical IPV behaviors. In addition, stronger endorsement of romantic jealousy was associated with evaluating nonphysical IPV as less abusive. However, romantic jealousy beliefs were not significantly associated with the perceived abusiveness of physical IPV behaviors. Findings support the conclusion that individuals’ IPV schemas contribute to a failure to identify nonphysical IPV behaviors as abusive, and this is particularly true for people who more strongly endorse romantic jealousy.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,5,37,Identifying Nonphysical Intimate Partner Violence in Relationships: The Role of Beliefs and Schemas,0,false,10.1177/0886260520938505,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2020.0,48.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Findings support the conclusion that individuals' IPV schemas contribute to a failure to identify nonphysical IPV behaviors as abusive, and this is particularly true for people who more strongly endorse romantic jealousy.""}",199,2168061,Kiara Minto,5305961,B.

200,"© The Author(s) 2020.Adolescents are at risk for becoming victims or perpetrators for a variety of forms of dating violence, including cyber violence, physical violence, psychological abuse, and sexual abuse. Interestingly, a robust predictor of dating violence is adverse experiences during childhood; however, factors that could mitigate the risk of dating violence for those exposed to adversity have seldom been examined. Using the cumulative stress hypothesis as a lens, the current study examined severity of adverse experiences as a predictor of dating violence within a sample at risk for both victimization and perpetration of dating violence: An adolescent (12–17 years old; N = 137) sample who were receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment. First, the current study aimed to replicate previous findings to determine whether adversity predicted dating violence and whether this varied by gender. Then, the current study examined one factor that could mitigate the relation between adversity and dating violence—parental emotion validation. High rates of maternal emotion validation resulted in no relation between adversity and dating violence perpetration and victimization; however, the relation was present at average and low levels of maternal emotion validation. Next, by adding gender as an additional moderator to the model, we found that high rates of paternal emotion validation extinguished the relation between adversity and dating violence perpetration, but only for adolescent boys. This pattern was not found for maternal emotion validation. Interestingly, the relation between adversity and dating violence victimization did not vary as a function of maternal or paternal validation of emotion for either child gender. These findings are discussed in terms of their meaning within this sample, possible future directions, and their implications for the prevention of dating violence.",2022-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,2,37,The Link Between Adversity and Dating Violence Among Adolescents Hospitalized for Psychiatric Treatment: Parental Emotion Validation as a Candidate Protective Factor,0,false,10.1177/0886260520926323,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2020.0,92.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It was found that high rates of paternal emotion validation extinguished the relation between adversity and dating violence perpetration, but only for adolescent boys, and the relation did not vary as a function of maternal or paternal validation of emotion for either child gender.'}",200,2038492,Nicole M.

201,"© 2022. American Psychological AssociationMost gun violence is committed by males, yet most males do not commit acts of gun violence, indicating that some aspect of masculinity that varies among males might account for this incongruence. I proposed that masculine gender role discrepancy strain, in combination with acquired capacity for gun violence, might account for why some boys and men commit acts of gun violence. The evidence for the role of discrepancy strain in the perpetration of violence was reviewed, with support coming from correlational studies, experiments, and qualitative studies in four social science disciplines: psychology, sociology, criminology, and cultural anthropology. This research suggested that males who feel that they do not measure up to their own standards for masculinity, or who are induced to feel that way after their masculinity is threatened, are likely to react violently. Furthermore, additional evidence linked discrepancy strain to three forms of actual gun violence: school shooters, mass shooters, and murder-suicides. I next examined the plausibility of the construct of acquired capability for gun violence, reviewing work on gun ownership, gun carrying, and gun enthusiasm. I concluded by providing recommendations for research and public education. In regard to the latter, I recommended that psychologists speak with parents, teachers, coaches, and other professionals who interact with boys to persuade them to carefully consider the messages that they are sending to boys",2022-02-03,Journal,Article,Psychology of Men and Masculinity,14031,2,23,Extending the Gender Role Strain Paradigm to Account for U.S. Males’ Gun Violence,0,false,10.1037/men0000385,American Psychological Association,Psychology of Men & Masculinities,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,201,5326447,R.

Soon after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports emerged noting increases in GBV and disruption of health services but few studies have empirically investigated these impacts. This study examines how the existing GBV funding and policy landscape, COVID-19, and resulting state policies in the first six months of the pandemic affect GBV health service provision in the U.S. Methods This is a mixed method study consisting of 1) an analysis of state-by-state emergency response policies review; 2) a quantitative analysis of a survey of U.S.-based GBV service providers (N = 77); and 3) a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with U.S.-based GBV service providers (N = 11). Respondents spanned a range of organization types, populations served, and states. Results Twenty-one states enacted protections for GBV survivors and five states included explicit exemptions from non-essential business closures for GBV service providers. Through the surveys and interviews, GBV service providers note three major themes on COVID-19's impact on GBV services: reductions in GBV service provision and quality and increased workload, shifts in service utilization, and funding impacts. Findings also indicate GBV inequities were exacerbated for historically underserved groups. Discussion The noted disruptions on GBV services from the COVID-19 pandemic overlaid long-term policy and funding limitations that left service providers unprepared for the challenges posed by the pandemic. Future policies, in emergency and non-emergency contexts, should recognize GBV as essential care and ensure comprehensive services for clients, particularly members of historically underserved groups.",2022-02-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,2,17,COVID-19 and gender-based violence service provision in the United States,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0263970,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2022.0,56.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Examination of existing GBV funding and policy landscape, COVID-19, and resulting state policies in the first six months of the pandemic affect GBV health service provision in the U.S. indicates GBV inequities were exacerbated for historically underserved groups.'}",202,2153659083,Rachel Sapire,2123015341,Jennifer Ostrowski,2124936525,Malia Maier,15991479,G.

Out of 1598 articles screened using a comprehensive electronic search of the PubMed, Web-of-Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases, 53 were included for review. Among risk factors for mental health problems, there are individual, familiar, social, and healthcare factors. Individual factors include childhood adversities, which show gender differences in distribution rates. However, current childhood abuse prevention programs are not gender-specific. Familiar factors for mental health problems include maternity issues and intimate partner violence, and for both, some gender-specific preventive interventions are available. Social risk factors for mental health problems are related to education, employment, discrimination, and relationships. They all display gender differences, but these differences are rarely taken into account in mental health prevention programs.

Twenty-two female IPV survivors aged 23–56 who reached PTG, according to the working definition used, were interviewed. The overriding theme of the study was “I’m a winner, not a vic-tim”, which describes the essence of the women’s experience of PTG. They described their experience as a shift from being suffering victims of IPV to becoming winners who enjoyed PTG. They felt that their positive attitude and personal strengths had helped them to reach PTG as well as to face the fact that they had been in an abusive relationship, thus forgiving and believing in themselves and taking responsibility for their own health and well-being. They sought knowledge about vio-lence, how to process it, and how to respond to triggers. They set boundaries for their perpetrators and were in as little contact with them as possible. They chose the company of positive, supportive, and constructive people and situations where they were not being controlled.

The present study addresses the gender gap in this field by exploring experiences of female gamers further by unravelling several positive experiences alongside some potentially harmful tendencies connected to gaming, including female gamers’ wishes and ambitions for their future gaming. A total of 20 female adult gamers across Europe were interviewed and results were analysed using thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: (i) to be or not to be a (female) gamer; (ii) improving social skills and levelling up on mental health; (iii) not always a healthy escape; and (iv) there is more to explore. The present study is one of few empirical studies regarding the construction of self-image, and experiences of female gamers. It has showed participants have a history as gamers from adolescence, but still face problems derived from the stigmatised internal gender self-image. Externally, female gamer stigmatisation may result in sexism, gender violence, harassment, and objectification. Additionally, females may decide against identifying as gamers, engaging in social gaming interaction, or hold back from online gaming in general, thereby missing out on the opportunities for recreation as well as social and psychological benefits that gaming brings. There is, therefore, urgent need for more research and actions to promote change, equity, education, and security for female gamers as well as their male counterparts.

However, this positive trend towards gender equity in sports has not transpired for women in medicine, especially in fields that care for elite athletes. This current review will discuss specific areas that can be tailored to help female athletes prevent injuries and optimize their athletic performance. We will also highlight how increased female team physician representation in sports may help optimize care for female athletes. Recent Findings: Female athletes are considered high risk for certain conditions such as ACL tears, patellofemoral pain syndrome, bone stress injuries, sport-related concussions, and sexual violence in sport. Addressing factors specific to female athletes has been found to be valuable in preventing injuries. Strength and conditioning can optimize athletic performance but remains underutilized among female athletes. Although diversity in healthcare workforce has been found to be beneficial for multiple reasons, women remain underrepresented in sports medicine. Increasing female team physician representation may positively impact care for female athletes.

Training on gender-based violence with active learning methodologies promotes the management of knowledge, reflection, and adaptation to change. Nurses, along with an educator, can construct knowledge with the same strategies they will use professionally. Purpose: To evaluate the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated of postgraduate nurses on gender-based violence before and after a reflection-based training program with dramatized problem-videos. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the knowledge in the activation of protocols, skills, and attitudes in the management of women who are victims of gender-based violence, the consolidation of learning, and the applicability to the workplace. Methods: Pre-post quasi-experimental study without a control group. A specifically validated and designed instrument was utilized to evaluate the dimensions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes when facing gender-based violence, before and after the training sessions, along with additional questions to assess if the participants possessed better tools to address gender-based violence. Results: The difference between the pre and post-tests was statistically significant for the dimensions knowledge, skills, and attitude (p < 0.05), with a smaller effect size in the dimensions skills and attitude.

The association between county-level poverty and the risk of firearm-related deaths among youth is unknown, however. Objective: To examine the association between county-level poverty concentration and firearm-related mortality rates in US youth. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed US firearm fatalities in children and young adults aged 5 to 24 years that occurred between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016. Data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Compressed Mortality File, and annual intercensal county population data were obtained from the US Census Bureau. Data analyses were conducted between November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. Exposures: County-level poverty was categorized into 5 groups: 0% to 4.9%, 5% to 9.9%, 10% to 14.9%, 15% to 19.9%, and ≥20% of the population living below the federal poverty level. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were firearm-related deaths in total and by specific intent (homicide, suicide, and unintentional) per 100000 youths over the entire study period. Multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to analyze the association between firearm-related mortality rates and county poverty concentration, controlling for demographic variables, urbanicity, and statewide firearm prevalence. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated, and statewide firearm prevalence was estimated. The population-attributable fraction (PAF) and years of potential life lost for each intent were calculated. Results: A total of 67905 firearm-related deaths among youth (predominantly composed of 60 164 male individuals [88.6%]) from 2007 to 2016 were analyzed. Of these deaths, 42512 were homicides (62.6%), 23034 were suicides (33.9%), and 1627 were unintentional (2.4%). Firearm-related mortality risk increased in a stepwise manner with increasing county poverty concentration. Compared with counties with the lowest poverty concentration, counties with the highest poverty concentration had an increased rate of total firearm-related deaths (adjusted IRR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.96-2.67), homicides (adjusted IRR, 3.55; 95% CI, 2.80-4.51), suicides (adjusted IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20-1.75), and unintentional deaths (adjusted IRR, 9.32; 95% CI, 2.32-37.4). The PAF was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.43-0.57) for all firearm-related deaths, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.57-0.73) for homicides, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.17-0.42) for suicides, and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.46-0.97) for unintentional deaths. This calculation translated to 34292 firearm-related deaths that would not have occurred if all counties had the same risk as counties with the lowest poverty concentration.

Although men’s differential capacity to inflict and sustain harm is posited as the reason male perpetrators and victims receive more blame for IPV, it is possible that other aspects of the construct of gender, such as gender role beliefs, underscore these effects. Using a sample of 323 college students and a factorial vignette design that varied body sizes and genders of victims and perpetrators, we examined the extent to which perceptions of physical injury accounted for the effects of perpetrator and victim gender on blame attributions, and whether adherence to traditional gender roles moderated any influences of gender unassociated with perceived injury. For female perpetrators, participants estimated lower levels of perceived injury and greater victim blame, with the former effect predominantly accounting for the latter. Male victims were viewed as less injured and more blameworthy, but the latter finding was not predominantly driven by injury perceptions. Perceived physical injury also did not account for why females perpetrating against males were blamed least. Controlling for differences in perceived injury, those holding more traditional gender views blamed victims of female violence more than victims of male-perpetrated violence. Notably, variations in body physical size were not associated with injury perceptions or blame attributions. These findings overall suggest that gender does influence blame attributions by way of perceived physical injury, but other aspects of the construct of gender are also relevant to these evaluations.",2022-02-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Family Violence,20369,3,37,Does Perceived Injury Explain the Effects of Gender on Attributions of Blame for Intimate Partner Violence?

215,"© The Author(s) 2020.Dehumanization has the potential to account for different abusive behaviors because it involves making negative judgments of others that make it easier to harm them. However, research has not resorted to this mechanism to analyze teen dating violence (TDV) perpetration, nor has it examined its association with the broader representations of others linked to attachment. The first objective of this study was to analyze whether dehumanization of one’s partner (lesser perceived agency and experience) and attribution of evilness were associated with a higher level of TDV perpetration and specific attachment styles. The second objective was to develop a structural equation model (SEM) that allowed integration of the links between all these factors. Participants in this cross-sectional study were 1799 adolescents who completed a survey in high schools. The results showed that those who were classified as high in TDV perpetration did perceive lower agency, lower experience, and higher evilness in their partners. The dehumanized perception of one’s partner was found to vary according to the attachment styles, with those highest in avoidance (dismissive and fearful) dehumanizing their partners the most. The SEM showed that dehumanization is related to avoidant and not to anxious attachment. It also pointed to the relevance of attribution of evilness in predicting TDV perpetration. The invariance of the model was tested across gender subsamples.

216,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThis study aimed to examine the effect of a syndemic theory-based intervention to reduce condomless anal intercourse among men who have sex with men (MSM) in India. In 2016/17, a pre- and post-test comparison group design was used to implement a syndemic theory-based intervention among 459 MSM (229, intervention; 230, standard-of-care comparison) recruited through non-governmental organizations in Chandigarh, India. The intervention group received two-session peer-delivered motivational interviewing-based HIV risk reduction counselling and skills training to improve sexual communication/negotiation and condom use self-efficacy, and screening/management of psychosocial health problems. The intervention's effect on consistent condom use was estimated using difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. Mediation analysis assessed the extent to which intervention effects on the outcome were mediated by changes in psychosocial health problems and condom use self-efficacy. A process evaluation assessed implementation fidelity and intervention acceptability. Baseline consistent condom use was 43% in the intervention group and 46% in the standard-of-care group. Baseline survey findings demonstrated that a psychosocial syndemic of problematic alcohol use, internalised homonegativity and violence victimisation synergistically increased condomless anal intercourse. Using DiD, we estimated that the intervention increased consistent condom use with male partners by 16.4% (95% CI: 7.1, 25.7) and with female partners by 28.2% (95% CI: 11.9, 44.4), and decreased problematic alcohol use by 24.3% (95%CI: −33.4, −15.3), depression by 20.0% (95% CI: −27.6, −12.3) and internalised homonegativity by 34.7% (95% CI: −43.6%, −25.8%). The mediation analysis findings suggested that the intervention might have improved consistent condom use by decreasing internalised homonegativity and by increasing condom use self-efficacy. The process evaluation showed high levels of acceptability/satisfaction among participants and high levels of implementation fidelity.

All rights reserved.Importance: Disproportionate levels of violence exist in lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, asexual, and other sexual identity (LGBQA+) communities, often starting in adolescence and young adulthood, but little research exists on the range of sexual violence (SV) experiences. Objective: To assess risk of experiences of sexual violence among California LGBQA+ adults during adolescence and young adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study analyzed data from Cal-VEX 2020, a state-representative survey of California residents aged 18 years and older, to assess associations between LGBQA+ identification and types of SV experienced in adolescence (ages 13-17 years) and young adulthood (ages 18-24 years) using gender-stratified adjusted logistic regression. Forms of SV included verbal, cyber, and coercion or physically aggressive sexual harassment; homophobic or transphobic slurs; and forced sex. Exposure: Sexual identity. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome of interest was experiences with any 5 forms of sexual violence (verbal sexual harassment, homophobic or transphobic slurs, cyber sexual harassment, sexual coercion or physically aggressive sexual harassment, and forced sex) during adolescence or young adulthood. Results: A total of 2102 contacted individuals (response rate, 26.2%) completed the Cal-VEX survey and were included in these analyses. Among these, the mean (SD) age was 46.6 (17.7) years, 1149 identified as female, 953 identified as male, and 214 respondents (9.6%) identified as LGBQA+. Compared with heterosexual individuals, LGBQA+ individuals had significantly higher odds of having experienced homophobic or transphobic slurs (women: AOR, 14.65; 95% CI, 5.14-41.77; men: AOR, 14.17; 95% CI, 6.96-28.86) and forced sex (women: AOR, 5.35; 95% CI, 2.74-10.43; men: AOR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.01-7.10) in adolescence. LGBQA+ women also had higher odds of having experienced verbal and coercion or physically aggressive sexual harassment in adolescence (AOR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.30-4.19). In young adulthood, LGBQA+ individuals also had higher odds of having experienced homophobic or transphobic slurs (women: AOR, 18.58; 95% CI, 7.12-48.49; men: AOR, 16.73; 95% CI, 8.26-33.92) in young adulthood. LGBQA+ men also had higher odds of having experienced homophobic or transphobic slurs (AOR, 16.73; 95% CI, 8.26-33.92); verbal (AOR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.44-7.53), cyber (AOR, 6.32; 95% CI, 1.50-26.52), and coercion or physically aggressive (AOR, 5.54; 95% CI, 2.08-14) sexual harassment; and forced sex (AOR, 21.26; 95% CI, 5.63-80.35) in young adulthood. Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study found that adult LGBQA+ individuals were at increased risk for having experienced SV across the continuum during adolescence and young adulthood, consistent with prior research. Multifold solutions are needed to support LGBQA+ youth, including altering social norms accepting SV and homophobia, creating safer schools and other institutional environments, and supporting healthy sexual and romantic partnerships..",2022-01-20,Journal,Article,JAMA Network Open,21100900345,1,5,Sexual Violence Associated with Sexual Identity and Gender among California Adults Reporting Their Experiences as Adolescents and Young Adults,1,true,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.44266,American Medical Association,JAMA Network Open,2022.0,30.0,0.0,,217,1402104535,David J.

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.Background Sexual abuse is a broad category of traumatic experiences that includes rape and any unwanted sexual contact with a body part or foreign object, whether penetrative, oral or otherwise. Although patients with mental illness have a higher risk of becoming victims of sexual abuse in adulthood, few studies investigate the proportion of male victims in this population. Their underrepresentation in research is a barrier to understanding the negative outcomes associated with sexual abuse in men. Aims We estimated the prevalence of recent (past year) and adulthood sexual abuse perpetrated by any perpetrator and separately by intimate partners in males diagnosed with a mental illness. Method To model the prevalences and heterogeneity arising from reports, we used Bayesian multilevel models. Prevalences were estimated for mixed-diagnosis, substance misuse, intellectual disability and post-traumatic stress disorder samples, and studies reporting specifically on intimate partner violence. This review was registered through PROSPERO (CRD42020169299) Results Estimated adult sexual abuse was 5.3% (95% Credibility Interval 1.6-12.8%) for past-year abuse and 14.1% (95% Credibility Interval 7.3-22.4%) for abuse in adulthood. There was considerable heterogeneity of prevalence between studies and diagnosis groups.

All rights reserved.The pervasive presence of social networks in every aspect of everyday life clearly characterises the generation of digital natives, whose cognitive and interpersonal skills have been formed in close contact with the development of information technology and media. This phenomenon is, however, even more significant in relation to the segment of the population born since the late 1990s. It is precisely with reference to this generation that one can speak of an almost total identification of social networks with the functions traditionally performed on the web, with the consequent omnipresence of these tools in the lives of the younger generations. The considerable incidence of the use of social networks in all the activities carried out daily by young people is particularly insidious in relation to the numerous profiles of unlawfulness that these tools can adumbrate, as regards both the hypothesis of committing acts that entail criminal liability, and the exposure to risks of victimisation. The ISTAT report (2019) highlights the lack of awareness among young people of the legal implications of their online behaviour, the increase in verbal violence and aggression on the web against girls compared to boys, and the dissemination of intimate or confidential material. Being accustomed to violent expressions, particularly at a developmental age, makes one unaware of risk situations, to which one exposes oneself both as a victim and as a persecutor.

221,"© The Author(s) 2022.Background: Mobility restrictions enforced by the UK Government in March 2020 as a response to COVID-19 resulted in those vulnerable to domestic abuse being confined in isolation with their abusers, deprived of safe spaces and many of their usual sources of support. Domestic abuse helplines therefore became an increasingly vital avenue for victim support, seeing a substantial increase in service demand during lockdown periods. Purpose: This project examined the nature and frequency of calls received by domestic abuse helplines since the first COVID-19 lockdown period. Design and Sample: Through semi-structured interviews with 11 domestic abuse helpline workers across UK services dedicated to a diverse range of populations. Results: Key themes identified through thematic analysis were: (1) Abusers weaponising government guidelines to justify and intensify abuse, and restrictions acting as both a barrier and facilitator to leaving an abusive relationship; (2) A loss of previously accessed support, with users uncertain about what help was available and issues around engaging with new forms of support; and (3) Isolation from social support networks, with callers reporting a loss of respite, lack of emotional and practical support, removal of third-party abuse monitoring opportunities, and subsequent mental health implications. Conclusions: These findings will act as a crucial guide for policy decision-making regarding support needs emerging from the pandemic and beyond, highlighting the importance of multi-agency partnerships and clear referral pathways to share the increasing financial burden of domestic abuse amongst services. The longer-term integration of more diverse options for remote support to reduce the risk of detection will be paramount as we emerge from the pandemic, but these should serve to offer a wider range of support routes for abuse victims rather than a replacement for face-to-face provision.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,30086,0,,“Abusers are Using COVID to Enhance Abuse”: Domestic Abuse Helpline Workers’ Perspectives on the Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on those Living with Domestic Abuse,1,true,10.1177/02654075221147203,SAGE Publications Ltd,Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,2022.0,44.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'These findings will act as a crucial guide for policy decision-making regarding support needs emerging from the pandemic and beyond, highlighting the importance of multi-agency partnerships and clear referral pathways to share the increasing financial burden of domestic abuse amongst services.'}",221,114015797,Zara P.

Issues of mistrust, stigma, and anticipation of abuse contribute to these rates. Lesbian and gay IPV victims have distinct experiences from their abuses with exposure to homophobia, heterosexism, discrimination, and threats of sexual disclosure, among others. These unique and additive minority stressors can lead to adverse health concerns, increase vulnerability to victimization, and elevate abuse perpetration. This study aimed to investigate whether experiences of minority stressors are associated with attitudes toward intimate partner violence among a sample of 240 lesbian and gay Filipinos (155 lesbian and 85 gay participants) aged 20 to 40. Through convenience sampling, lesbian and gay Filipinos completed the Sexual Minority Stress Scale (SMSS) and Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scale-Revised (IPVAS-Revised). Comparing the minority stressors levels among the participants, lesbians expressed higher expectations of rejection, while gay men experienced more sexual minority adverse events. Lesbians also reported higher satisfaction with outness. Regarding IPV, gay men expressed slightly more favorable attitudes toward abuse, which could make them at risk of becoming victims or perpetrators. Internalized homophobia was associated with more favorable attitudes toward abuse and control, indicating its contribution to more favorable IPV attitudes, although the explanatory power was modest.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Sexuality and Culture,145138,0,,Minority Stressors and Attitudes Toward Intimate Partner Violence Among Lesbian and Gay Individuals,1,true,10.1007/s12119-022-10046-y,Springer,Sexuality & Culture,2022.0,84.0,0.0,,223,2196022614,Marc Eric S.

This study aims to identify mechanisms through which these factors are reproduced on all levels of the gender system (individual, family, social milieu, professional milieu, state institutions). The focus is made on the case of the Autonomous Territorial Unit Gagauzia in Moldova. The study relies on systems analysis methods and approaches based on the institutional economic theory, systems theory, and gender economics to assess the impact of socio-economic factors on the likelihood of intimate partner violence (IPV) in this region. In Gagauzia, there is a decline in women’s opportunities to realize their economic rights and ensure their financial independence. While the incomes of households are falling, gender discrimination, including physical violence, is perceived as justified by more and more people. Another contributing factor is the lack of effective mechanisms for IPV prevention. The factors contributing to IPV are related to the system of specialized institutions, which impose sanctions for violating the rules of gender stereotypical behavior. The study proposes a set of projects to promote more egalitarian norms on all levels of the gender system.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Changing Societies and Personalities,21100929891,0,6,"Social and Economic Factors of Violence Against Women in the South of Moldova: Identification, Estimation, and Mechanisms of Elimination",1,true,10.15826/CSP.2022.6.3.192,Ural Federal University,,,,,,224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to explore and understand the impact of COVID-19 on income security, mental health, HIV risk and access to health services among men who have sex with men (MSM) in India. We conducted a concurrent mixed methods study from April to June 2020, including a cross-sectional survey and in-depth semi-structured interviews with MSM recruited from three non-governmental organisations providing HIV prevention services in Chandigarh, India. We examined the associations of sexual minority stressors (sexual stigma, internalised homonegativity), economic stressors, and stress due to social distancing, with depression and anxiety, HIV risk, and access to health services. Survey findings (n = 132) indicated that internalised homonegativity and stress related to social distancing were significantly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results also showed reduced access to condoms, HIV testing and counselling services. Qualitative findings (n = 10) highlighted adverse economic impacts of COVID-19, including loss of employment/wages and engaging in survival sex work, which contributed to psychological distress and HIV risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable psychological and financial distress among low socioeconomic status MSM in India, including those involved in sex work–communities already marginalised in economic, family and healthcare sectors.

226,"© 2022 Elsevier Masson SASBackground: Violence against women represents an urgent public health problem and has been an increasingly important topic in society's discussions and concerns. Although studies report a high prevalence of injuries to the face and head of women victims of intentional violence, this physical damage has never been investigated by grouped studies. Thus, the objective of this systematic review was to research the characteristics and the overall prevalence of oral-maxillofacial trauma in women victims of physical violence caused by men. Methods: Searches were carried out on Medline (via PubMed) and Lilacs (via Virtual Health Library) and on gray literature until June 16, 2020 (updated on February 12, 2021) without restriction on the year of publication or language. Results: A total of 27 studies involving 9,318 women victims of aggression by men and 3,738 oral-maxillofacial traumas were included. The prevalence of oral-maxillofacial trauma among all injuries in women was 51% (95% CI 28% - 74%). There was no significant difference in the chance of occurrence between soft tissue injuries (bruises, lacerations, abrasions, edema, erythema, and epistaxis) and hard tissue injuries (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.43 - 4.80). The relationship between the victims and the aggressors was mainly that of intimate partners and relatives.

227,"© 2022 The Speech Pathology Association of Australia Limited.Purpose: The right to communicate, by any means, is key to participation in peaceful and just societies. Participation relies on societal equality which, in turn, depends upon consensus that everyone has the same rights, as well as responsibility to uphold the rights of all. People who experience communication disability are, however, often invisible, misunderstood, stigmatised, and under-enumerated, particularly in resource-limited settings, including humanitarian contexts. A lack of identification and understanding of needs exclude this group from equal societal participation and exposes them to risks, including sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), which has no place in a peaceful, just, and fair society. In this commentary we explore the importance of the full inclusion and participation of people who experience communication disability, to the fulfilment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16. Result: There is a lack of specialist assistance for people who experience communication disability in resource-limited and humanitarian contexts. A broader approach to community and service-provider capacity-building on communication disability demonstrates potential to build stronger institutions and increase societal inclusion and participation, thereby reducing exposure to risks, such as SGBV. Such approaches include increasing public understanding and use of accessible communication strategies, as well as addressing negative attitudes/behaviours and fear. Conclusion: Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) must be prepared to expand their spheres of influence and develop long-term relationships with stakeholders who can instigate change. This may involve de-emphasising our SLP credentials, instead rebranding ourselves as inclusion specialists, with a focus on communication disability. Increased inclusion, participation, and protection are achievable for people who experience communication disability if they are understood, counted, and served appropriately. This requires alignment of communication rights agendas with international development priorities. As such, this commentary paper focuses on peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG16) and simultaneously addresses aspects of good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), gender equality (SDG 5), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).",2022-01-01,Journal,Note,International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,14000155897,0,,"Participation, equality, and justice in Rwanda for people who experience communication disability: Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 16",0,false,10.1080/17549507.2022.2140828,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,2022.0,8.0,0.0,,227,50362513,H.

228,"© The Author(s) 2022.Adolescent sexual harassment victimization is increasingly recognized as a strong risk factor for dating violence victimization and perpetration. Research on this association has focused on older adolescents and on sexual harassment at a single time point rather than chronic exposure. Furthermore, potential mechanisms, such as psychological distress, are not well understood. The goals of this study were to identify whether sexual harassment victimization and psychological distress were reciprocally related, whether chronic psychological distress and sexual harassment victimization in early adolescence were associated with higher levels of dating violence involvement measured in mid-adolescence, and whether these relationships differed between boys and girls. We used longitudinal data from 4,718 US middle school students to fit regression models for the associations between sexual harassment victimization and psychological distress. We then used data from a subset of 1,279 students followed up in high school to fit marginal structural models for sixth- to eighth-grade psychological distress and sexual harassment victimization as predictors of dating violence involvement measured in ninth grade. We found that (1) sexual harassment victimization was positively, concurrently associated with psychological distress, with a stronger association among girls than boys; (2) psychological distress was positively, prospectively associated with sexual harassment victimization among girls but not boys; (3) chronic sixth- to eighth-grade psychological distress was not significantly associated with dating violence victimization or perpetration measured in ninth grade; and (4) chronic sixth- to eighth-grade sexual harassment victimization was associated with significantly higher levels of dating violence victimization and perpetration measured in ninth grade. The results support a reciprocal relationship between distress and sexual harassment victimization for early adolescent girls, and they call for further attention to gender differences in the content and impact of sexual harassment.

230,"© 2022 Family Process Institute.For decades, researchers, interventionists, and the lay public have subscribed to the notion that couples low in relationship satisfaction and/or experiencing psychological, physical, or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) have communication skills deficits. In contrast, experimental studies of communication have concluded that differences were more likely due to partners' “ill will than poor skill.” We revisited this debate by recruiting a fairly generalizable sample of couples (N = 291) via random-digit dialing and asking them to discuss two top conflict areas (“at your best” and “as you typically do”), thus measuring will—conscious inhibition of hostility and negative reciprocity and production of positivity (i.e., the “conflict triad”). The conflict triad was observed with the Rapid Marital Interaction Coding System, Second Generation. We found partial support for the hypotheses grounded in Finkel's I3 meta-model. Frequency of hostility was associated with a complicated satisfaction × IPV-extent × conversation type × gender interaction, indicating that couples' communication skills are multi-determined. Unhappier couples showed almost no change in positivity when at their best, whereas happier couples nearly doubled their positivity despite their considerably higher typical positivity mean. Negative reciprocity was associated with satisfaction and IPV-extent but not conversation type, implying that immediate instigation combined with risk factors overwhelms conscious inhibition.

231,"© 2022 American Society of Criminology.What transpires in a dispute, even a violent dispute, is affected by the tendency for adversaries to engage in “limited offending.” We focus on one restraint: the tendency of men to limit their aggression in their disputes with women. Analyses are based on an incident-level survey about interpersonal disputes administered to 503 men who are incarcerated and 220 men who had never been incarcerated. Using multinomial and logistic regression models, we examined the extent to which an adversary's gender predicted dispute-related behaviors. The evidence suggests that the chivalry norm has pervasive effects on the behavior of men during their disputes with women. Men are more likely to engage in remedial actions (e.g., apologies) when their adversary is a woman, as opposed to another man. In addition, men are less likely to make violent threats and engage in physical attacks when their adversary is a woman, even after they have themselves been physically attacked. When men are violent, they are less likely to injure a woman than a man.

We address some of these silences through a dialogical analysis of mixed methods data from the Contexts of Violence in Adolescence Cohort study (CoVAC) with young people in Uganda. The analysis illuminates girls’ experiences of sexual violence by school staff, and patterns of discrimination and inequality that increase vulnerabilities. The data reveal how schools vary in their institutional responses and, in the absence of institutional support, girls develop strategies to resist sexual coercion.

Structured risk assessments, when regularly completed, have been effective in prompting interventions to reduce aggression in Behavioral Health (BH) settings. Methods: This quasi-experimental study evaluated the effectiveness of the Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression – Inpatient Version (DASA) validated screening tool to reduce aggressive outbursts in an emergency department (ED) setting with BH patients awaiting transfer to a psychiatric facility. The tool was used in 4 non-psychiatric EDs from a large health care system. Chart audits were completed to record initial patient DASA scores observed at triage and at subsequent intervals during the ED encounter. ED staff documented interventions used for patients. Inclusion criteria included adults 21 years and older following a telepsychiatry consultation with a recommendation for BH inpatient admission. Pre-/post-implementation aggressive events were collected to assess ED DASA use. DASA scores from BH ED patients were examined to increase understanding of patient utilization. Staff workplace safety was examined to compare staff safety perception pre- and post-DASA implementation. Results: Violent events were reported statistically significantly higher post-DASA implementation. There was an increased risk of elevated DASA scores for specific diagnoses and genders. An increased awareness of the importance of reporting workplace violence improved documentation.

All Rights Reserved.Gender-based violence is a public health issue that needs high concern to eliminate discrimination and violence against women and girls. Several cases are through the offline organization and the respective online platform. However, many victims share their experiences and stories on social media platforms. Twitter is one of the methods for locating and identifying gender-based violence based on its type. This paper proposed a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Network CNN with GloVe to perform multi-classification of gender violence. Intimate partner violence, harassment, rape, femicide, sex trafficking, forced marriage, forced abortion, and online violence against women are e eight gender violence keyword for data extraction from Twitter text data. Next is data cleaning to remove unnecessary information. Normalization converts data into a structure the machine can recognize as model input. The evaluation considers cross-entropy loss parameters, learning rate, an optimizer, and epochs. LSTM+GloVe vector embedding outperforms all other methods.

This study explored barriers to, and facilitators of, wellbeing and access to resources for IPV-exposed, pregnant women living in Nuevo León, Mexico. Method: Participants were N = 43 individuals (n = 17 women receiving IPV or prenatal health services, n = 20 mental health professionals, and n = 6 medical professionals) who participated in nine focus groups in Nuevo León. Qualitative focus group data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Several barriers to women’s access to community resources and wellbeing were identified, including intrapersonal barriers, structural barriers, widespread violence exposure, and family expectations and power structures. Similarly, multiple facilitators of women’s wellbeing and access to resources emerged from the data, including women’s intrapersonal empowerment, support from women’s immediate social circles, and supports in the broader community. Conclusions: Results suggest that women in Nuevo León who experience IPV during pregnancy face significant barriers to accessing supports that could foster wellbeing. Women also possess inherent strengths and actively seek to supports that contribute to their resilience in the face of IPV. Intervention strategies should focus on ways to overcome common barriers experienced by IPV-exposed women, while incorporating strategies to bolster personal empowerment and connection with existing community resources.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Family Violence,20369,0,,"A Thematic Analysis of Barriers to and Facilitators of Wellbeing and Resource Access for IPV-Exposed, Pregnant Women in Mexico",0,false,10.1007/s10896-022-00450-1,Springer,Journal of Family Violence,2022.0,28.0,0.0,,241,92384601,Jessica R.

243,"© 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.The Dark Tetrad is a cluster of four ""dark""personality traits which are socially aversive, with distinct conceptual roots, but which are intercorrelated: narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and sadism. Narcissism is associated with inflated self-esteem and feelings of grandiosity; psychopathy involves reduced empathy and a lack of remorse or guilt; Machiavellianism is characterized by a tendency for manipulation for own personal benefit; sadism involves feelings of pleasure with the pain or suffering of others. Sexism is the group of beliefs linked with the perceived superiority of men over women. Previous studies have found relationships between the Dark Tetrad and the tolerance of the use of sexual violence and between the former and sexism. Furthermore, sexism has been linked with the acceptance of sexual violence. This study aims to revise the literature exploring the link between each of the components of the Dark Tetrad and the legitimation of the use of sexual violence; it also aims to present the associations that have been found between the aforementioned variables and sexism and related concepts, in multiple studies. Based on the previous literature, suggestions for aims of future research in this field (i.e., Dark Tetrad, sexual violence, sexism) are made, more specifically exploring the relative effect of each of the components of the Dark Tetrad in the explanation of the legitimation of sexual violence, as well as exploring a possible, at least partial, mediation of sexism in the link between each of the ""dark""traits and the acceptance of sexual violence.",2022-01-01,Journal,Review,European Psychologist,14120,0,,"Dark Tetrad, Acceptance of Sexual Violence, and Sexism: A Comprehensive Review",0,false,10.1027/1016-9040/a000485,Hogrefe Publishing GmbH,European Psychologist,2022.0,110.0,0.0,,243,2069458152,Rodrigo Costa,30193472,Marisalva Fávero,144178499,D.

The present study uses a cross-sectional survey (N = 550) to examine three research questions. First, does exposure to domestic violence during childhood predict dating violence victimization later in life? Second, does justifying violence mediate the relationship between domestic violence experience and dating violence victimization? Third, does justifying violence show a difference depending on the sexes of the perpetrator in influencing victimization of violence? A series of structural equation modeling analyses were conducted. The results showed that witnessing interparental violence and experiencing child abuse directly influenced dating violence victimization. Second, the justification of violence mediated the relationship between witnessing interparental violence and dating violence victimization. Third, justifying male to female violence influenced dating violence victimization.

For Latinx LGBTQ people specifically, Latinx cultural values, beliefs, and traditions (e.g., familismo, gender norms, respeto, religion and spirituality) play an important role in their relationship with their family members. To date, however, little is known about the unique experiences of Latinx bi+/plurisexual people within the context of their families. In a sample of 63 Latinx bi+/plurisexual people, we used a qualitative approach to explore: (a) factors leading to the disclosure of one’s bi+/plurisexual identity to family members, (b) experiences of Latinx bi+/plurisexual people within their Latinx families after disclosure; and (c) aspects of Latinx culture that influenced the experiences of Latinx bi+/plurisexual individuals and their families. Thematic analysis revealed five major themes: (1) decision-making process (presence of religiosity, fear of being excluded from the collective and violence, perceived negative attitudes toward bisexuality, selective disclosure, and disclosure of authenticity), (2) family reactions to sexual identity disclosure (acceptance, rejection, and invalidation, disregard, and erasure of bi+/plurisexuality), (3) cultural factors that influenced family reactions to disclosure of sexual identity (religion and spirituality, familismo and respeto, strict views on gender norms), (4) impact of family reactions on the individual (validated and affirmed, relieved and confident, hurt and disappointed, and identity concealment), and (5) impact of family reactions on the individual’s relationship with the family (stronger bonds and distanced, disrupted, and strained).

246,"© Copyright 2022 Rimjhim and DandapatGender-based violence (GBV) has been plaguing our society for long back. The severity of GBV has spurred research around understanding the causes and factors leading to GBV. Understanding factors and causes leading to GBV is helpful in planning and executing efficient policies to curb GBV. Past researches have claimed a country's culture to be one of the driving reasons behind GBV. The culture of a country consists of cultural norms, societal rules, gender-based stereotypes, and social taboos which provoke GBV. These claims are supported by theoretical or small-scale survey-based research that suffers from under-representation and biases. With the advent of social media and, more importantly, location-tagged social media, huge ethnographic data are available, creating a platform for many sociological research. In this article, we also utilize huge social media data to verify the claim of confluence between GBV and the culture of a country. We first curate GBV content from different countries by collecting a large amount of data from Twitter. In order to explore the relationship between a country's culture and GBV content, we performed correlation analyses between a country's culture and its GBV content. The correlation results are further re-validated using graph-based methods. Through the findings of this research, we observed that countries with similar cultures also show similarity in GBV content, thus reconfirming the relationship between GBV and culture",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,PeerJ Computer Science,21100830173,0,8,Is gender-based violence a confluence of culture?

248,"© 2022. American Psychological AssociationEvidence is accumulating that men frequently experience and are harmed by intimate partner violence (IPV), although this form of IPV has only recently been studied. Recent studies suggest that social stereotypes may negatively influence men’s help-seeking and outcomes following IPV. We assessed the third-party perception of a man versus a women who experienced physical and psychological IPV. Using video vignettes of psychological/physical IPV that varied only in the gender of the perpetrator and victim, 168 participants recruited from an online survey platform and a Midwestern private university were randomly assigned to view an interaction depicting either a man or woman IPV victim. Participants rated their emotional response immediately after watching the vignette, followed by perceptions of the IPV victim and perpetrator. Participants reported less negative affect after viewing IPV perpetrated against a man versus against a woman, and male IPV victims were rated as deserving of less sympathy, less in need of medical, psychological, and legal help, and less successful, powerful, and socially desirable than female IPV victims. Post hoc analyses regarding perpetrator criminality and identification of the IPV victim using the “victim” label also differed by IPV victim gender. Our findings suggest that preconceived notions based on gender roles impede the identification of men as victims and likely influence their treatment by friends, medical and mental health care providers, and legal authorities. Further research is needed to inform the unique interpersonal and intrapersonal stereotyping that may explain men’s help-seeking and outcomes in IPV victimization.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Psychology of Men and Masculinity,14031,0,,Third-Party Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence Victimization in Men,0,false,10.1037/men0000406,American Psychological Association,Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinities,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,248,2147291801,Paul A.

To deal with this menace, both the government and non-governmental organizations have taken steps at various levels to improve police service delivery, competence-building and awareness-raising on GBV, establish women’s shelters, establish women’s development and welfare units in district welfare departments, and open helplines. However, these initiatives are limited, scattered and lack coordination. Our research aims to better understand the nature of GBV issues, identify the barriers in addressing GBV, and how the introduction of information communication technology (ICT) might improve both competence on GBV and the coordination of the mechanisms dealing with GBV. Using a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews of relevant actors involved in the process of dealing with GBV. Our research findings show that GBV is a deeply rooted and complex structural phenomenon that requires a well-planned, well-coordinated and politically driven strategy. While information communication technology (ICT) has the potential to improve competence of stakeholder and processes of reporting, mitigating and preventing GBV, access to technology by rural women is limited.

250,"© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.The present study focuses on the interrelationships among gender, self-control, and intimate partner violence (IPV). The extant bodies of literature suggest that both IPV and low self-control are gendered phenomena. That is, males tend to display lower mean levels of self-control than females, and there are notable differences in IPV between males and females. Since both phenomena are gendered, it is plausible that the relationship between self-control and IPV may also be gendered. To that end, the purpose of the present study is to explore the role played by gender in the relationship between self-control and IPV. To accomplish this, a sample of currently dating undergraduate and graduate college students (n = 960) was analyzed. The first objective is to determine whether self-control and IPV vary across gender. The second objective is to examine whether self-control predicts IPV differently by gender. Results indicated partial support for Gottfredson and Hirschi’s general theory of crime. Self-control operated similarly on IPV for both males and females, supporting the gender-neutrality of their theory. However, the interaction between gender and self-control did not significantly impact IPV offending. Moreover, the gender gap in crime as it relates to self-control remains in question as females were more likely than males to commit more types of IPV.

With this refugee influx, Rohingya women’s sexual and reproductive health (SRH) conditions have been greatly affected. This study aims to find out the condition of Rohingya refugee women’s sexual and reproductive health in terms of contraception, sanitation, and hygiene. Methods: A qualitative research approach was applied to conduct the research. For primary data, semi-structured questionnaires were conducted with 50 in-depth interviews, a focus group discussion (FGD) consisting of 10 respondents, and three key informant interviews (KIIs). Results: The results of the study revealed that their sexual and reproductive health is being affected, how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the government are strengthening their sexual and reproductive health, and what the current scenario of their SRH is. Conclusion: The results concluded that their SRH conditions are improving from the initial crisis stage, but many factors like gender-based violence and patriarchal society impacts are continuously affecting their SRH continuously. Policy Implications: Sexual and reproductive health is also included in social policy implications. Rohingya women refugees are part of migration and the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis. Where social policy implies involvement in meeting societal needs, education, health, migration, poverty, and other crucial global factors, ensuring the safe and better sexual and reproductive health of Rohingya refugees is certainly one of them.

Journal of Advanced Nursing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim: This commentary elucidates the challenges for nurses in effectively identifying and supporting gay and bisexual men who experience intimate partner violence and offers guidance for education, training and practice to nurses when responding to patients who may be experiencing intimate partner violence. Design: The commentary highlights issues raised by Callan et al.’s (2020) scoping review, translating the experiences of male sexual minorities undergoing abuse to a nursing context, in particular, issues such as homophobic remarks and heteronormative practices in health care and nursing-led environments militate against the identification of individuals who may be experiencing coerced sexual risk-taking, homophobia and sexual orientation outing. Results: Intimate partner violence is a widespread issue that permeates across heterosexual and LGBTQ+ communities, while impressing on the everyday realities of nurses. The potential for discrimination against sexual minority patients may be offset by improving training, education and offering recommendations for nurses in how to identify IPV and how to assess risk. Conclusions: Nurses possess essential training and transferable skills such as empathy, adaptability, active listening and diplomacy and are ideally placed to facilitate disclosure of intimate partner violence. Gaps in knowledge, training and organizational support for nurses may be effectively addressed through drawing on extant research and international best practice guidelines.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.High school policy debate is an academically rigourous and highly competitive US activity—elite debaters often go on to top universities and pursue successful careers. Access to the skills that debate teaches is invaluable for high schoolers, but these benefits are not equally accessible to all. As a historically male-dominated activity, the number of male debaters remains disproportionately high and the activity continues to be highly influenced by gender hierarchies. Through semi-structured interviews, this paper addresses the question: what makes high school policy debate a unique educational space for producing gender dynamics, and what are the impacts of those dynamics on debaters that identify as women? Our findings show that debate is a complex and contradictory space. While women in debate are disadvantaged by gender imbalance, implicit activity norms, and instances of objectification and sexual violence, the activity also arms students with tools to disrupt these gender hierarchies.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Gender and Education,29390,0,34,Gender dynamics in high school policy debate: propagating gender hierarchies in advocating ‘better’ futures,1,true,10.1080/09540253.2022.2094348,Routledge,Gender and Education,2022.0,64.0,0.0,,256,114398768,S.

257,"© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.There is considerable scholarship to support the idea that shared cultural narratives—about what it means to belong, to contribute, to be of value—are very effectively mediated through the mass media, and, in particular, through popular fictional formats such as feature film. This article analyses two contemporary, state-supported Danish films, Nymphomaniac, Director’s Cut and Dronningen (Queen of Hearts), arguing that these cultural artefacts explore the notion of cultural citizenship: a mode of citizenship that I define as the capacity to speak and be heard, and which cultivates a sense of belonging. Through their portrayal of sexually transgressive female characters, these films grapple with and subvert the gendered expectations around femininity, appearing to reinforce the international reputation of Denmark as a politically progressive state. By situating these depictions within their broader social context, though, I illustrate how they present the agency to use one’s own voice as a right that is not, in fact, possessed equally by all citizens. Building on existing literature on cultural citizenship and the Scandinavian welfare state system, I advocate for increased scholarly attention to the role of cinema in creating space for identification and the exploration of belonging.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Feminist Media Studies,5700168400,0,,"Private desires, public narratives: the intersection of sexuality and cultural citizenship in Danish state-supported cinema",0,false,10.1080/14680777.2022.2099929,Routledge,Feminist Media Studies,2022.0,18.0,0.0,,257,1480977119,Djuna Hallsworth,,,,,,,,,,,13.0,24.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

259,"© 2022. American Psychological AssociationIntimate partner violence (IPV) has been recognized as a threat to the well-being of women and men in different-sex and same-sex relationships worldwide. Research on this topic has been increasing, but more information on the variables associated with IPV may improve responses to IPV prevention and intervention. With this study, we aim to analyze the relationship between psychosocial variables and frequency of IPV, in potential male and female victims in different-sex and same-sex relationships. Three hundred four participants (232 women—76.3%; 72 men—23.7%) were recruited via an online survey, and inquired on sociodemographic data, suffered violence using the Conflict Tactics Scale-2 (CTS-2), and psychosocial variables (e.g., familiar isolation, self-esteem, selfblame, dependence). Overall, higher frequency of violence was associated with higher family and social isolation for both female and male participants. For female participants, a model that considers both sociodemographic variables and psychosocial ones (e.g., social isolation, submission, dependence) best predicted frequency of experienced violence (R2 = 33.1%). For males, only three psychosocial variables predicted experienced violence (e.g., social and familiar isolation, and submission), and retained more explicative power (R2 = 41.3%). No significant differences were found in the victimization between victims in different-sex and same-sex relationships, but family isolation was higher in same-sex relationships. Our findings shed light on relevant variables and their potential contribution to explain the frequency of violence among male and female participants, in different and same-sex relationships.

For this, the conceptual production of social justice developed by Nancy Fraser was taken as a basis, which for the author can be analyzed through demands for redistribution, recognition, and representation. Furthermore, the main elements for the identification and conceptual delimitation of the subjects with which this theoretical-methodological perspective decides to focus its reflections and actions together were sought in the history of the constitution of social occupational therapy. It was possible to highlight the relevance of the themes of genders and sexualities for the production of reflections and practices from the theoretical-methodological perspective of social occupational therapy, since the dissident subjects and groups of genders and sexualities experience, in their daily lives, social inequalities, and injustices that prevent them from accessing certain social rights, exercising their citizenship, having their demands represented in state political dimensions and having their existence recognized in different social realities. This proposal for reflection is not based on the understanding that these subjects and groups demand professional actions because they are considered “vulnerable”, but because they understand that by producing experiences that go beyond gender and sexuality norms, these subjects and groups go through numerous situations of violence and oppression, different forms of social injustice, and neglect of social rights.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Brazilian Journal of Occupational Therapy,21100899904,0,30,"Social occupational therapy, social justice, and LGBTI+ population: with whom we produce our reflections and actions?

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Available data suggest that women with disabilities have an increased risk of sexual violence, but little is known about the situation of those women living in resource-limited settings. Objectives: To assess the burden and examine the drivers of sexual violence among women with disabilities. Methods: This is a pooled analysis of two population-based surveys conducted in Cameroon and Burundi. Adults with and without disabilities were randomly recruited from the general population. Structured interviews were conducted at both sites to collect data on participants’ functional limitations, life-course history of sexual violence, education, employment, and resources. Only women with disabilities whose impairments started before the age of 10 years (n = 359) and women without disabilities (n = 720) are included in this analysis. The age-adjusted prevalence of violence was computed, and risk factors were assessed using a discrete survival regression and mediation analysis. Results: At both sites, the participants with disabilities had a lower education level and had an increased risk of food insecurity. The pooled age-adjusted prevalence of lifetime sexual violence was 19.8% (95%CI:15.3–24.3) among women with disabilities and 11.7% (95%CI:9.3–14.1) among those without disabilities (ORap: 2.0, 95%CI:1.4–2.8). Women with cognitive limitations and those with visual impairments had the highest risk of sexual violence (ORap: 3.5 (95%CI:2.0–6.3) and 2.7 (95%CI:1.4–5.0), respectively). Over the life course, the risk of sexual violence was especially high among women with disabilities who had lived with an intimate partner before the age of 25 years (p < 0.001). Education level mediated approximately one-third of the total association between disability and sexual violence (p = 0.001). There was no evidence of an indirect effect through food insecurity.

While there have been calls from feminist organizations to combat domestic violence during the outbreak of COVID-19, there are legal and social barriers that impede women’s resort to help from others.

Sometimes, these strategies err on the side of caution; in other instances, pursuers can take a bolder approach to their courtship endeavors. In the present research, we developed a measure capturing the degree to which a romantic pursuer intends to take a presumptuous course of action. Across five studies (Ntotal = 2,137), we validated a 13-item self-report measure: the presumptuous romantic intentions (PRI) scale. First, we used a training set to refine item content and explore factor structures. Then, using a validation set, we confirmed a bifactor solution with one general and three auxiliary factors. We then observed test–retest reliability over periods of 3 and 4 weeks, found strict measurement invariance across both relationship status (single and partnered individuals) and across gender (women and men). We also found that PRI predicted actual presumptuous romantic behavior over the subsequent month. Finally, we established a pattern of convergent and discriminant associations with relationship measures, socioemotional outcomes, executive function, dark personality traits and more.

Pan African Medical Journal.Introduction: gender-based violence remains one of the most persistent human rights abuse in the world and with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant mitigating protocols; Gender-based violence (GBV) could be on the rise with changes in its pattern and presentation. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of GBV among victims presenting in a tertiary health facility in South-East Nigeria during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: this was a retrospective cross-sectional study, among 710 victims of GBV, who reported and received care at the GBV unit in a tertiary hospital in Enugu, South-east Nigeria. A pro forma designed by the researchers was used to collect secondary data from GBV facility screening forms and folders of all patients that reported any form of GBV over a 3-year period (2018-2020). Results: majority (89.9%) of victims of GBV were females and over a half (51.4%) of the cases were in the age group 20-39 years. In total, 56.8% of the GBV cases had been sexually abused. The pattern of GBV over the three years period under study revealed an increase in proportion for both sexual and physical/emotional violence, with a peak in 2019 and a reduction of cases in 2020. Persons below 19 years of age were 23 times more likely to experience sexual violence, than those between 40-59 years of age (AOR: 23.332; 95% CI: 11.037-49.325) p<0.001.

While prior theorizing has emphasized issues such as men’s feelings of jealousy, the role of concerns and conflict related to men’s actions has not been as thoroughly investigated. We draw on the life course perspective as background for assessing conflict areas related to men’s and women’s actions during the young adult period, and subsequently the association between such concerns and the odds of reporting IPV in a current/most recent relationship. Building on a longitudinal data set focused on a large, diverse sample (Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study, n = 904), we administered surveys that assessed whether disagreements about potential conflict areas—including but not limited to infidelity—related to male or female partner’s actions. Concerns about women’s and men’s actions were both related to the odds of reporting IPV experience, but disagreements about male partners’ actions during young adulthood were actually more common, and relative to concerns about women’s actions, more strongly associated with IPV. Research and programmatic efforts should give additional attention to specific areas around which couples’ disagreements develop and conflicts sometimes escalate. A dyadic approach adds to the frequent emphasis on emotion management and control that center primarily on one partner’s problematic relationship style—thus addressing the ‘form’ but not the ‘content’ of intimate partner conflicts.

273,"© 2022, Crown.We argue that social computing and its diverse applications can contribute to the attainment of sustainable development goals (SDGs)—specifically to the SDGs concerning gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls, and to make cities and human settlements inclusive. To achieve the above goals for the sustainable growth of societies, it is crucial to study gender-based violence (GBV) in a smart city context, which is a common component of violence across socio-economic groups globally. This paper analyzes the nature of news articles reported in English newspapers of Pakistan, India, and the UK—accumulating 12,693 gender-based violence-related news articles. For the qualitative textual analysis, we employ Latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling and propose a Doc2Vec based word-embeddings model to classify gender-based violence-related content, called GBV2Vec. Further, by leveraging GBV2Vec, we also build an online tool that analyzes the sensitivity of Gender-based violence-related content from the textual data. We run a case study on GBV concerning COVID-19 by feeding the data collected through Google News API. Finally, we show different news reporting trends and the nature of the gender-based violence committed during the testing times of COVID-19. The approach and the toolkit that this paper proposes will be of great value to decision-makers and human rights activists, given the prompt and coordinated performance against gender-based violence in smart city context—and can contribute to the achievement of SDGs for sustainable growth of human societies.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,19400158593,1,,Social mining for sustainable cities: thematic study of gender-based violence coverage in news articles and domestic violence in relation to COVID-19,1,true,10.1007/s12652-021-03401-8,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,2022.0,53.0,0.0,,273,2161915497,Muhammad Asad Manzoor,73378773,Saeed-Ul Hassan,79529749,Amina Muazzam,2038777,Suppawong Tuarob,2647296,R.

274,"© 2022, The Author(s).Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a worldwide societal concern. Adversities such as IPV are known to impinge upon mental health and socio-economic development. However, much of the existing literature addresses single or dual constructs of IPV abuse rather than capturing the more common polyvictimisation experience and how they impact on mental health. Using a Northern Irish university student sample (n = 753), latent class analysis was employed to examine distinct patterns of IPV experience stratified by gender (n = 184 males (24.44%); n = 569 females (75.56%)). Regressions were then employed to assess whether there were differential associations between the latent classes of IPV and a range of mental health outcomes. While a greater number of females reported experiencing IPV, patterns of IPV victimisation across gender were found to be similar. Results indicated that three latent classes were optimal across both genders; one characterised by Low or no IPV (males: 48.37%; females: 56.24%), another characterised by predominantly physical and emotional denigration (males: 34.24%; females: 27.42%), and a third characterised by multiple endorsements of different types of IPV (males: 17.39%; females: 16.34%). Differences in mental health outcomes across gender are noted. Classes characterised by multiple forms of abuse report an increased risk of mental health outcomes including posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression but not alcohol use. The study extends the existing literature which highlights the importance of acknowledging psychological and emotional abuse (PEA) as a significant abuse type in the IPV experience. The study also reaffirms the need for definitional clarity and development of standardised measurement tools of PEA within the research context and beyond.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Family Violence,20369,1,,Exploring the Existence of Distinct Subclasses of Intimate Partner Violence Experience and Associations with Mental Health,1,true,10.1007/s10896-022-00393-7,Springer,Journal of Family Violence,2022.0,86.0,0.0,,274,5759705,S.

275,"© 2022, Crown.Gender-based Violence (GBV) during the perinatal period is a serious concern as it is associated with many adverse outcomes for both the mother and the baby. It is well known that violence is under-reported. Thus, official statistics (both police reports and survey data) underestimate the prevalence of violence in general and during the perinatal period specifically. In this study conducted in Canada, we sought to explore the barriers to and facilitators of women disclosing their experiences of GBV within healthcare services to safely facilitate more disclosure in the future and reduce the harms that arise from GBV. We used thematic analysis to analyze in-depth interviews with 16 healthcare providers (nurses, midwives and physicians) and 12 survivors of GBV. The data reflect three main themes: “raising awareness of gender-based violence”, “creating a shift in the healthcare system’s approach toward gender-based violence” and “providing support for survivors and care providers.” Our findings suggest that the healthcare system should increase its investments in raising awareness regarding GBV, training healthcare providers to respond appropriately, and building trust between survivors and healthcare providers. Healthcare providers need to be aware of their role and responsibility regarding identifying GBV as well as how to support survivors who talk about violence. Expanding a relationship-based approach in the care system and providing support for both survivors and health care providers would likely lead to more disclosures.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Family Violence,20369,0,,How to Facilitate Disclosure of Violence while Delivering Perinatal Care: The Experience of Survivors and Healthcare Providers,1,true,10.1007/s10896-022-00371-z,Springer,Journal of Family Violence,2022.0,59.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The barriers to and facilitators of women disclosing their experiences of GBV within healthcare services are explored to safely facilitate more disclosure in the future and reduce the harms that arise from GBV.'}",275,144171914,A.

Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was carried out in the Scopus, WoS and PsycINFO databases.The search yielded 42 articles published in English or Spanish over an unlimited timeframe. Results showed that process-oriented, trait-oriented, and outcomesoriented definitions of resilience were all adopted in the research and that assessment methods also differed across studies. Individual, relational, and contextual factors were found as resilience correlates.

Revista Colombiana de Sociologia.All Rights Reserved.The article ethnographically explores the practices, discourses, and experiences of leaders of Colombian evangelical religious organizations concerning the identification and attention of sexual violence in their communities of influence, mainly populations in situations of forced displacement and affected by the armed conflict. Sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war by all actors in the Colombian armed conflict, affecting mainly women throughout the country and against which impunity and silence prevail. In this context, the article starts from the recognition of the influence of communities and religious discourses of these organizations that have a broad presence in the territories, urban and rural, as well as their role in promoting or obstructing women’s rights and attention of gender-based violence, including sexual violence. The proposed analysis addresses individual and collective aspects of evangelical organizations, presenting stories and testimonies of religious leaders, doctrinal discourses, main characteristics in evangelical organizations, and elements of the context that influence the understanding and attention of sexual violence or the exclusion and invisibility in the religious practices. Based on semi-structured interviews with church leaders and social initiatives from six evangelical organizations, three categories of classification are proposed to different experiences and knowledge regarding the phenomenon of sexual violence in religious communities. The three categories present debates and tensions over five factors: first, the taboo that surrounds sexual violence; second, the training for leaders of evangelical communities while addressing sexual violence; third, the articulation of churches with state institutions to handle sexual violence cases; fourth, the risks in territories where armed violence prevails; and finally, the obstacles that strengthen the invisibility and encourage the naturalization of sexual violence",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Revista Colombiana de Sociologia,20600195529,0,45,“The churches cannot remain silent”.

279,"© 2022. The Authors.Background: Several reports show that suicide is the second and third leading cause of untimely death in young people below the age of 30. Little, however, is known about the profile and trend of suicide in this country due to lack of systematic studies and a lack of national statistics on suicide. This study seeks to examine the profile and pattern of suicide cases recorded within northern Ghana for the past decade. Aim: This study aimed to report the prevalence of suicide as an independent cause of death; the choice of suicide method and the alleged reasons for suicide within the northern part of Ghana. Setting: Retrospective review of coroners’ reports within the northern part of Ghana. Method: In this descriptive study, 309 completed suicides as archived by the office of the coroner were examined. The coroners’ reports of 309 individuals, whose deaths received a suicide verdict or an open verdict in which the cause of death was likely to be suicide from 2008 to 2017, were examined. Student’s t-test was used to ascertain significant age differences between the genders involved. Results: Amongst the 309 decedents examined, approximately, 61% were male, with ages ranging from 5 to 81 years. Hanging and poisoning were the most commonly used methods to complete suicide accounting for 124 (40.1%) and 102 (33.0%) deaths, respectively. Regarding the reasons for completed suicide, 78 (25.2%) were because of unknown reasons and 66 (21.4%) were because of social stigma. There was a notable decline in the prevalence of suicide from 2014 to 2017 compared with the years from 2010 to 2013.

We conducted a scoping review with a focus on measurement to assess the forms of measurement and study design utilized to explore the intersection of violence against women with disabilities, and to identify strengths and limitations in current approaches to measuring violence against women with disabilities. This scoping review is designed to inform current debates and discussions regarding how to generate evidence concerning violence against women with disabilities. Methods and results We conducted systematic searches of the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, PILOTS, ERIC, Social Work Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Social Services Abstracts, ProQuest Criminal Justice, and Dissertations & Theses Global, and conducted structured searches of national statistics and surveys and grey literature available on-line. We identified 174 manuscripts or reports for inclusion. n = 113 manuscripts or reports utilized acts-specific measurement of violence. In terms of measurement of disability, we found that amongst the included manuscripts and reports, n = 75 utilized measures of functioning limitations (n = 20 of these were Washington Group questions), n = 15 utilized a single question approach and n = 67 defined participants in the research as having a disability based on a diagnosis or self-report of a health condition or impairment. Discussion This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of measurement of violence against women with disabilities and measurement of violence within disability-focused research. We identified several important gaps in the evidence, including lack of sex and disability disaggregation, limited evidence concerning adaptation of data collection methods to ensure accessibility of research activities for women with disabilities, and limited evidence concerning differential relationships between types of disability and violence exposure.

Study measures were rated from court and clinical files, along with treatment participation, and recidivism outcome data were obtained from official criminal records. The three measures had strong interrater and convergent validity, and moderate to high predictive accuracy for violent, nonviolent, and general recidivism. The measures significantly predicted outcome across male, female, Indigenous, and non-Indigenous groups; however, prediction magnitudes showed some variability with respect to specific risk/protection domains and outcome types. Cox regression survival analyses demonstrated incremental predictive validity for each violence risk measure, but not protection measures, with respect to each of the three recidivism outcomes. Moreover, pre-/posttreatment measurements of change on the VRS-YV dynamic factors were significantly associated with decreased nonviolent recidivism, controlling for baseline risk and protection.

283,"© Copyright 2021 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.Despite longstanding investigation into the experiences and needs of female victims of domestic violence and abuse (DVA), and a burgeoning literature on abused men, information on service engagement by both of these groups is limited, particularly in direct comparison. This is in part due to a lack of large-scale quantitative data on victim needs upon presentation to services. The current study presents the first of a two-part examination of data collected from specialist DVA services in the UK supporting predominantly high-risk clients between 2007 and 2017. Case data from a total of 34,815 clients (858 men and 33,957 women) was assessed across five key areas: demographic characteristics, routes of referral into service, context of abuse, reported abuse type, and outcomes and risk factors of abuse. Clients tended to be white, with men being older on average. Men and women had similar referral routes, but men were more likely to have a disability of some kind and women were more likely to have children living/visiting the home. Men were more likely to report physical abuse than women, whilst women were more likely to report sexual abuse and harassment/stalking. There were no significant differences in the frequency of reporting jealous/controlling behaviours. Results also showed that women were more likely to have attempted to leave, and to call the police, with men more likely to suffer from alcohol/drug problems and reporting poorer physical health. However, it should be noted that almost all such differences had small effect sizes, suggesting greater similarity between male and female clients than difference. Results are discussed in the context of the importance of recognising both the shared and unique risk factors of client groups upon presentation to services.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Partner Abuse,19900191409,0,13,"Comparing the Demographic Characteristics, and Reported Abuse Type, Contexts and Outcomes of Help-Seeking Heterosexual Male and Female Victims of Domestic Violence: Part I – Who Presents to Specialist Services?",2,,10.1891/PA-2021-0009,Springer Publishing Company,Partner Abuse,2022.0,0.0,0.0,,283,117468929,B.

Although most injuries are to the head, face, and neck, the intersection of IPV and brain injury (BI) remains largely unrecognized. This article reports on unexplored COVID-19-related impacts on service providers and women survivors of IPV/BI. Objectives: To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on survivors and service providers. Participants: Purposeful sampling through the team's national Knowledge-to- Practice (K2P) network and snowball sampling were used to recruit 24 participants across 4 categories: survivors, executive directors/managers of organizations serving survivors, direct service providers, and employer/union representatives. Design: This project used a qualitative, participatory approach using semistructured individual or group interviews. Interviews were conducted via videoconferencing, audio-recorded, and transcribed. Transcripts were thematically analyzed by the research team to identify themes. Findings: COVID-19 has increased rates and severity of IPV and barriers to services in terms of both provision and uptake. Three main themes emerged: (1) implications for women survivors of IPV/BI; (2) implications for service delivery and service providers supporting women survivors of IPV/BI; and (3) key priorities. Increased risk, complex challenges to mental health, and the impact on employment were discussed. Adaptability and flexibility of service delivery were identified as significant issues, and increased outreach and adaptation of technology-based services were noted as key priorities. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified IPV/BI, increased challenges for women survivors and service providers, and accentuated the continued lack of IPV/BI awareness.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Women are exposed to a variety of life stressors, particularly violence, during their lifetime which increases the risk of developing various psychiatric and somatic diseases, with the dysregulated secretion of cortisol as one potential biological mechanism. We examined the association between violence and other life stressors and hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in a population of urban women. We included 470 adult women (age = 21–86 years) attending the Cancer Detection Clinic in Iceland. The Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R; 30-items) was used to assess exposure. HCC was measured with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. We used linear regression models to assess the association between life stressors and log-transformed HCC.

286,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.For centuries, music has been an inseparable part of many human cultures. The rise of the hip-hop culture over the last 50 years has turned into a powerful movement, empowering people from various communities and making their voices heard. However, certain parts of hip-hop and rap music have started being associated with misogyny, substance abuse and violent behavior. This study aims to find a correlation between lyrics of hip-hop and rap songs that glorify such illicit behavior through their lyrics and the actual rate of criminal activity of individuals that are directly or indirectly influenced by hip-hop culture. This research employs NLP concepts to build a model that detects song lyrics that falls into any of the 3 categories—“Misogyny,” “Substance Abuse” and “Violence.” A comparative study is conducted by training multiple models including multinomial naïve Bayes, random forest and LSTM on a manually collected and labeled dataset consisting of rap song lyrics released between 1970 and 2020. The highest performing model (LSTM—87% accuracy) was subsequently used to detect objectionable lyrics in popular rap songs of the decade of 2010–2019. To obtain a correlation of these with the criminal activity of the target population, official data of criminal activity (2010–2019) of citizens aged 0–29 from the largest hip-hop influenced areas in the world are compiled. This dataset is analyzed and to obtain strong evidence of a correlation between objectionable rap song lyrics being promoted through song lyrics and the criminal tendencies of the youth that is primarily affected by it.",2022-01-01,Book Series,Conference Paper,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,21100901469,0,334,Hip-Hop Culture Incites Criminal Behavior: A Deep Learning Study,0,false,10.1007/978-981-16-6369-7_41,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Intelligent Sustainable Systems,2021.0,9.0,0.0,,286,2139920170,Niharika Abhange,2146195121,Rahul Jadhav,2149283361,Siddhant Deshpande,2139937619,Swarad Gat,48978532,Varsha Naik,113240546,Saishashank Konduri,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,

Research carried out on the issue has focused on identifying the causes of this phenomenon. However, difficulties have been found in designing and implementing effective prevention programs. In this context, primary healthcare physicians are one of the most important figures in screening for and detecting this phenomenon, since, in many cases, they are the first to have contact with the victims. The present study focuses on the qualitative analysis of a series of interviews carried out with 95 primary healthcare physicians in Extremadura, Spain. These interviews addressed various questions related to the theoretical and practical knowledge that the physicians have about the topic.

Determining correlates of this risk behavior is needed to help mitigate its prevalence. Two potential correlates are physical activity and school safety. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of physical activity, school safety, and non-prescription steroid use within a sample of adolescents from the 2015–2019 US National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). A multi-stage cluster sampling procedure yielded a representative sample of US adolescents from the 2015–2019 YRBS (n = 44,066; 49.6% female). Two latent variables indicating physical activity and unsafe schools were the independent variables. The dependent variable was a self-report of non-prescription steroid use. A weighted structural equation model examined the associations between physical activity and unsafe schools with non-prescription steroid use, controlling for age, sex, BMI percentile, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status. The latent physical activity variable did not associate with non-prescription steroid use (β = 0.007, 95%CI: −0.01–0.02, p = 0.436); however, the unsafe schools latent variable did associate with non-prescription steroid use (β = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.59– 0.69, p < 0.001).

289,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdRationale: Symptoms of psychological distress at an early age have proved to undermine adolescents' academic achievements, as well as their personal and social well-being. The literature acknowledges a wide range of risk factors that cause psychological distress, while at the same time emphasizing the role of social support as a protective factor. On the other hand, feelings of unsafety as a possible source of psychological distress have been so far largely overlooked in the literature. Objective: The present study explores the consequences of a specific stressor (feeling unsafe) and asks whether social support can act as a moderator in the association between subjective unsafety and psychological distress. Methods: A multi-group structural equation model was run with a sample of 2876 young adolescents aged 10–12 enrolled in educational centers in the city of Barcelona, Spain. Results: The results show that direct exposure to sibling violence at home and bullying at school are significant predictors of psychological distress, regardless of biological sex. The hypothesis of a negative correlation of subjective perceptions of unsafety on psychological distress is also supported, although neighborhood-based risk factors emerge as a greater source of distress for females than for males. The involvement of supportive adults is associated with lower levels of perceptions of unsafety and distress in both groups, but girls seem capable of drawing more effectively on alternative sources of support, specifically their peers, to enhance their safety at school and in the neighborhood. Conclusion: Overall, gender differences in our model overlap with socio-environmental inequalities (low income, exposure to violence and conflictual public spaces), thus suggesting that an intervention into the root causes of these inequalities could contribute to lowering psychological distress in early adolescence.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,2,293,Feeling unsafe as a source of psychological distress in early adolescence,1,true,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114643,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2022.0,69.0,0.0,,289,98312624,Riccardo Valente,1412748140,Lucrezia Crescenzi-Lanna,,,,,,,,,29.0,104.0,6.0,6.0,19.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
290,"© 2021 by the Research Society on AlcoholismBackground: Although research has established an association between alcohol use and sexual assault, few studies have examined how characteristics of the perpetrator may influence sexual aggression depending upon whether alcohol is consumed by the perpetrator and/or the victim. This laboratory-based investigation was designed to disentangle the effects of individual differences in masculine gender role stress (MGRS) and the perpetration of sexual aggression as a function of (1) men's acute alcohol intoxication and (2) whether a woman was consuming alcohol or not. Method: A community sample of 156 men participated in two laboratory sessions, during which they completed a self-report measure of MGRS (Session 1) and a modified version of the sexual imposition paradigm after consuming an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage (Session 2). In this paradigm, participants and a male friend were told that an ostensible female participant had consumed or not consumed alcohol. They were also told that she did not wish to view sexual content. Participants were then provided the opportunity to make the female confederate view a sexually or non-sexually explicit film. Sexual aggression was operationalized by selection of the sexually explicit film. Results: A hierarchical logistic regression showed that men higher in MGRS who were intoxicated were (1) more likely than sober men to select the sexually explicit film when the woman was intoxicated and (2) less likely than sober men to select the sexually explicit film when the woman was sober. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the perpetration of sexual aggression is most likely among men with higher MGRS when there is concordance in drinking (i.e., when either the man and woman are both drinking or are both not drinking).",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,24791,0,46,"A laboratory study of the effects of men's acute alcohol intoxication, perceptions of women's intoxication, and masculine gender role stress on the perpetration of sexual aggression",2,,10.1111/acer.14753,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Findings suggest that sexual aggression perpetration is most likely among higher masculine gender role stress men when there is concordance in drinking and whether a woman was consuming alcohol or not.'}",290,34200116,R.

Objective: To assess the prevalence and associations of CSA and suicide attempts, substance use, and mental health disorders as a function of sex (female, male) and sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, heterosexual-identified with same-sex attraction and/or behavior, heterosexual-identified without same-sex attraction and/or behavior, and unsure). Participants and setting: Data were collected using structured diagnostic face-to-face interviews in a nationally representative sample of 36,309 US adults. Methods: We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling to analyze data from the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III). Results: Childhood sexual abuse was most prevalent among sexual minorities, especially bisexual females. Nearly one-third of bisexual females (30.6%) reported experiencing two or more types of CSA, p <.001.

However, little is known about the ways in which trans women of color negotiate gender affirmation, in the context of the risk of social exclusion and violence. Aim: This article discusses the experience and construction of gender transitioning and gender affirmation for trans women of color living in Australia, associated with the risk of social exclusion or violence. Method: In-depth interviews and photovoice were conducted with 31 trans women of color, analyzed through theoretical thematic analysis informed by intersectionality theory. Results: The following themes were identifed: 1) ‘Gender affirmation: A bittersweet experience’, with three subthemes: ‘Self-empowerment is tempered by family rejection’, ‘Migration facilitates gender affirmation’ and ‘Gender affirmation and social support’; 2) ‘Being a trans woman of color’, subthemes: ‘Bodily agency and passing’, ‘Femininity as pleasure and cultural self-expression’, and ‘Resisting archetypal White hetero-femininity’; 3) ‘Hormones, surgical intervention and navigating the health system’. Conclusion: Gender transitioning and gender affirmation involved the intersection of gender, cultural, social class and sexual identities, accomplished through personal agency and with the support of significant others.

Method: Data were collected from 103 adult female same-gender couples (N = 206) and analyzed using actor–partner interdependence models. Results: The odds of engaging in physical assault in the last year were positively associated with partner (but not actor) discrimination, alcohol use, and anxiety symptoms and negatively associated with both actor and partner relationship adjustment, emotional intimacy, and partner (but not actor) dedication and social support. The odds of engaging in high levels of psychological aggression in the last year were positively associated with actor and partner depressive and anxiety symptoms, actor (but not partner) negative communication, and partner (but not actor) discrimination and negatively associated with both actor and partner emotional intimacy, actor (but not partner) relationship adjustment, dedication, and social support.

We conducted a secondary analysis using cross-sectional survey data, which constituted a nationwide prison sample surveyed between July and November 2017. In total, 699 participants (462 male and 237 female prisoners), who completed the self-administered questionnaire during imprisonment were recruited for the study. The prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviors was as follows: inconsistent condom use (78.4% male, 81.7% female), multiple sexual partners (61.3% male, 41.3% female), history of sexually transmitted diseases (14.1% male, 23.6% female), and trading sex for drugs (15.6% male, 17.7% female). A logistic regression analysis showed that MA use during sex increased the likelihood of high-risk sexual behavior in both male (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.41–10.07) and female prisoners (AOR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.33–5.00). Additionally, in female prisoners, a history of sharing MA injection (AOR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.06–2.42) increased high-risk sexual behavior.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper considers how complex family circumstances such as parental separation, custody disputes and family violence intersect with the organisational cultures and everyday practices of schools. In particular, we are concerned with the ways that coercive control–a strategy used predominantly by men to dominate, control and oppress women in the context of intimate partner relationships–can be deployed to manipulate and coerce the organisational networks of schools into furthering abusive agendas. Informed by cultural theory and research from sociology of education, legal studies, criminology and family violence, we show how what we term the ‘coercion of organisational networks’ (CON) both relies upon and exploits systemic misogyny and gendered unequal relations of power. These issues underpin institutional strategies often used by schools to keep parents–and mothers, in particular–at a distance. When affected by separation, divorce and family violence, being positioned in problematic terms can create additional risks for women and children. We argue that without adequate understandings of coercive control as practices within a broader constellation of systemic misogyny and gender inequalities, and in the absence of organisational cultures committed to addressing these, schools are considered complicit in perpetuating family violence and its effects.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Critical Studies in Education,19700187630,2,63,"Schools, separating parents and family violence: a case study of the coercion of organisational networks",1,true,10.1080/17508487.2021.1919165,Routledge,Critical Studies in Education,2021.0,73.0,0.0,,304,15764709,S.

Most research to date has focused on negative aspects of the neighborhood environment, with little attention being paid to the specific positive features, in particular the social environment, that promote cardiovascular resilience among Black adults.We examined whether better neighborhood physical and social characteristics are associated with ideal CVH among Black adults, as measured by Life's Simple 7 (LS7) scores. Methods: We recruited 392 Black adults (age 53 ± 10 years, 39% men) without known CV disease living in Atlanta, GA. Seven neighborhood domains were assessed via questionnaire: asthetic quality, walking environment, safety, food access, social cohesion, activity with neighbors, and violence. CVH was determined by LS7 scores calculated from measured blood pressure; glucose; cholesterol; body mass index (BMI); and self-reported exercise, diet, and smoking, and categorized into poor (0–8), intermediate (9–10), and ideal (11–14). Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association between neighborhood characteristics and the odds of intermediate/ideal CVH categories compared with poor CVH after adjustment for age, gender, household income, education, marital status, and employment status. Results: Better scores in the neighborhood domains of social cohesion and activity with neighbors were significantly associated with higher adjusted odds of ideal LS7 scores (OR 2.02, 95% CI [1.36–3.01] and 1.71 [1.20–2.45] per 1 standard deviation [SD] increase in respective scores). These associations were stronger for both social cohesion (OR 2.61, 95% CI [1.48–4.61] vs. 1.40 [0.82–2.40]) and activity with neighbors (OR 1.82, 95% CI [1.15–2.86] vs. 1.53 [0.84–2.78]) in Black women than men. Specifically, better scores in social cohesion were associated with higher odds of ideal CVH in exercise (OR 1.73 [1.16–2.59]), diet (OR 1.90 [1.11–3.26]), and BMI (OR 1.52 [1.09–2.09]); better scores in activity with neighbors were also similarly associated with higher odds of ideal CVH in exercise (OR 1.48 [1.00–2.19]), diet (OR 2.15 [1.23–3.77]), and BMI (OR 1.45 [1.07–1.98]; per 1 SD in respective scores).

However, few studies have explored, in-depth, the health-related experiences, perceptions, needs, and priorities of transgender women of color living in the U.S. South, a region that poses unique challenges to achieving health for transgender people. Aims: This study explored the social determinants of health, healthcare experiences, and health-related priorities of transgender women of color living in the U.S. South. Methods: Using a community-based participatory research approach, we conducted iterative in-depth interviews with 15 African American/Black and Latinx transgender women in North Carolina in May-July 2019 for a total of 30 interviews. We analyzed interview data using constant comparison, an approach to grounded theory. Results: Participants’ mean age was 34 (range 19–56) years. Twenty themes emerged that were categorized into three domains: (1) social determinants of health (family rejection; bullying, discrimination, and violence; isolation; policy barriers; mistrust in systems; employment obstacles; sex work; high cost of care; transportation barriers; church antagonism; and substance misuse), (2) healthcare experiences (emotional burden of healthcare interactions; name and gender misidentification; staff discomfort and insensitivity; sexual risk assumptions; and use of nonmedical or predatory providers), and (3) health-related priorities (understanding healthcare; respect at all levels of healthcare; inclusive gender-affirming care; and comprehensive resources). Discussion: Transgender women of color living in the U.S. South face profound health barriers compounded throughout the life course and have unmet healthcare needs. Participants faced multilayered minority stressors: racial discrimination from society at large and within the LGTBQ community; gender identity discrimination within their regional context and racial/ethnic communities; and exclusion from existing health equity movements for transgender women of color, which often are found in and focus on larger urban communities.

Three main findings are discussed including: (1) stalking assault rates and stalking-related fear levels differ by victim gender which may be, in part, because more women are stalked by males and by (ex)partners; (2) prior violence to the victim, threats, and frequency of confrontation were associated with stalking assault regardless of victim gender; and (3) among those not assaulted, threats and the stalker not caring about severe consequences was associated with stalking-related fear regardless of victim gender, but other factors associated with stalking-related fear differed by victim gender and assault experience. Arrest and increased concern for victim safety by professionals often hinges on physical violence and victim injury. However, educating professionals who work with stalking victims about the factors associated with assault, as well as the full range of harms and risks beyond assault, is crucial to supporting victims and holding stalkers accountable for the crime of stalking.",2022-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Family Violence,20369,6,37,"Examining Stalking Assault by Victim Gender, Stalker Gender, and Victim-Stalker Relationship",0,false,10.1007/s10896-020-00221-w,Springer,Journal of Family Violence,2020.0,84.0,0.0,,312,144042004,T.

313,"© 2020. American Psychological AssociationPsychological research has been at the forefront of efforts to document, understand, and prevent sexual harassment, sexual coercion, sexual violence, and intimate partner abuse on college campuses. Collectively, these various forms of gender-based violence and misconduct (GBVM) are highly prevalent on college campuses and exert wide-ranging negative effects on students’ mental health and academic success. A recent resolution by the American Psychological Association outlined the field’s research contributions and ongoing commitment to help prevent campus sexual assault. Our article builds on this initiative by offering 10 recommendations to psychology researchers, educators, and practitioners to address critical gaps in GBVM knowledge and practice through novel applications of psychology. These recommendations include: (a) Develop interventions to reduce and prevent faculty-perpetrated GBVM; (b) encourage and support professional sanctions for credibly accused faculty perpetrators of GBVM; (c) explore alternative models of graduate student mentorship; (d) develop improved risk prediction models for GBVM perpetration; (e) enhance selective and indicated prevention focused on individual and contextual risk; (f) support improvements in institutional responses to Title IX cases; (g) study the experiences and needs of student populations traditionally underrepresented in GBVM research, including racial/ethnic minority, sexual minority, and religious minority students, international students, and returning (nontraditional) students; (h) refine and disseminate campus interventions to promote relationship skill development; (i) refine and disseminate classroom-based prevention models; and (j) train and support the next generation of antiviolence scholars, clinicians, educators, and activists.

Participants and Methods: We analyzed data from an online survey that was distributed to students (n = 6,331) at a university in the Southeast. Results: Path analyses indicated disclosure to friends and family partially mediated the relationship between victimization and consequences, such that an increase in the number of disclosures was associated with an increase in the number of consequences.

The Brazilian National Alcohol and Drugs Survey is a probabilistic household survey that collected data from 4,283 Brazilians aged 14 years and older in 2012. The prevalence of rape was 2.3% (n = 107) and the majority (n = 81) of rapes were reported by women. Female gender increased the chances of rape (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.7, 4.3]).

318,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Gender violence is a problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Among its many manifestations Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is one of the most common. In Spain, a police monitoring protocol has been developed to minimize recidivism in IPV cases. This protocol is complemented by VioGén, an Intimate Partner Violence Risk Assessment Tool (IPVRAT) created by the Spanish State Secretariat for Security of the Ministry of Interior (SES) for risk prediction. VioGén's goal is to help the authorities determine what security and safety measures are most suitable. This paper improves on the current version of VioGén by introducing a model based on machine learning and data science and by studying the predictive value of exogenous and historical variables. The model is fitted on an anonymized database provided by SES and extracted from VioGén. This database includes the 2-year evolution of 46,047 new cases of IPV violence reported between October 2016 and December 2017, making it the largest database analyzed in the field. Obtained results show a clear improvement in the predictive capabilities of the new model against the original system, where it would have corrected more than 25% of the infra-protected cases, while improving the overall accuracy at the same time. Finally, lessons learned from the performed study and experiments are reported to aid in the design of future IPVRAT.

Although there is interest in empowering young people to challenge harmful norms, there is scant research on how individual agency, and, specifically, the “power to” resist or bring about an outcome relates to peer violence perpetration and victimization in early adolescence. This manuscript explores the relationship between individual agency and peer violence perpetration and victimization among very young adolescents (VYAs) living in two urban poor settings in sub-Saharan Africa (Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Blantyre, Malawi). Methods and findings The study draws on two cross-sectional surveys including 2,540 adolescents 10 to 14 years from Kinshasa in 2017 (girls = 49.8% and boys = 50.2%) and 1,213 from Blantyre in 2020 (girls = 50.7% and boys = 49.3%). The sample was school based in Malawi but included in-school and out-of-school participants in Kinshasa due to higher levels of early school dropout. Peer violence in the last 6 months (dependent variable) was defined as a four categorical variable: (1) no victimization or perpetration; (2) victimization only; (3) perpetration only; and (4) both victimization and perpetration. Agency was operationalized using 3 scales: freedom of movement, voice, and decision-making, which were further divided into tertiles. Univariate analysis and multivariable multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate the relationships between each agency indicator and peer violence. The multivariable regression adjusted for individual, family, peer, and community level covariates. All analyses were stratified by gender and site. In both sites, adolescents had greater voice and decision-making power than freedom of movement, and boys had greater freedom of movement than girls. Boys in both settings were more likely to report peer violence in the last six months than girls (40% to 50% versus 32% to 40%, p < 0.001), mostly due to higher rates of a perpetration–victimization overlap (18% to 23% versus 10% to 15%, p < 0.001). Adolescents reporting the greatest freedom of movement (Tertile 3) (with the exception of girls in Kinshasa) had a greater relative risk ratio (RRR) of reporting a perpetrator–victim overlap (boys Kinshasa: RRR = 1.9 (1.2 to 2.8, p = 0.003); boys Blantyre: RRR = 3.8 (1.7 to 8.3, p = 0.001); and girls Blantyre: RRR = 2.4 (1.1 to 5.1, p = 0.03)). Adolescents with the highest decision-making power in Kinshasa also had greater RRR of reporting a perpetrator–victim overlap (boys: RRR = 3.0 (1.8 to 4.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, girls and boys in Kinshasa with intermediate decision-making power (tertile 2 versus 1) had a lower RRR of being victimized (Girls: RRR = 1.7 (1.02 to 2.7, p = 0.04); Boys: RRR = 0.6 (0.4 to 0.9, p = 0.01)). Higher voice among boys in Kinshasa (Tertile 2: RRR = 1.9 (1.2 to 2.9, p = 0.003) and Tertile 3: 1.8 (1.2 to 2.8, p = 0.009)) and girls in Blantyre (Tertile 2: 2.0 (1.01 to 3.9, p = 0.048)) was associated with a perpetrator–victim overlap, and girls with more voice in Blantyre had a greater RRR of being victimized (Tertile 2: RRR = 1.9 (1.1 to 3.1, p = 0.02)). Generally, associations were stronger for boys than girls, and associations often differed when victimization and perpetration occurred in isolation of each other. A main limitation of this study is that the cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow a causal interpretation of the findings, which need further longitudinal exploration to establish temporality. Conclusions In this study, we observed that peer violence is a gendered experience that is related to young people’s agency. This stresses the importance of addressing interpersonal violence in empowerment programs and of including boys who experience the greatest perpetration–victimization overlap.",2021-12-01,Journal,Article,PLoS Medicine,144840,1,18,"Assessing the relationship between agency and peer violence among adolescents aged 10 to 14 years in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo and Blantyre, Malawi: A cross-sectional study",1,true,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003552,Public Library of Science,PLoS Medicine,2021.0,31.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'In both sites, adolescents had greater voice and decision-making power than freedom of movement, and boys had greaterfreedom of movement than girls, while boys in both settings were more likely to report peer violence in the last six months.'}",320,51001863,A.

321,"© 2021, The Author(s).The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption to essential health service provision globally, including in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recognising the criticality of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, we review the actual reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SRH service provision and evidence of adaptations that have been implemented to date. Across LMICs, the available data suggests that there was a reduction in access to SRH services, including family planning (FP) counselling and contraception access, and safe abortion during the early phase of the pandemic, especially when movement restrictions were in place. However, services were quickly restored, or alternatives to service provision (adaptations) were explored in many LMICs. Cases of gender-based violence (GBV) increased, with one in two women reporting that they have or know a woman who has experienced violence since the beginning of the pandemic. As per available evidence, many adaptations that have been implemented to date have been digitised, focused on getting SRH services closer to women. Through the pandemic, several LMIC governments have provided guidelines to support SRH service delivery. In addition, non-governmental organisations working in SRH programming have played significant roles in ensuring SRH services have been sustained by implementing several interventions at different levels of scale and to varying success. Most adaptations have focused on FP, with limited attention placed on GBV. Many adaptations have been implemented based on guidance and best practices and, in many cases, leveraged evidence-based interventions. However, some adaptations appear to have simply been the sensible thing to do. Where evaluations have been carried out, many have highlighted increased outputs and efficiency following the implementation of various adaptations. However, there is limited published evidence on their effectiveness, cost, value for money, acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability. In addition, the pandemic has been viewed as a homogenous event without recognising its troughs and waves or disentangling effects of response measures such as lockdowns from the pandemic itself. As the pandemic continues, neglected SRH services like those targeting GBV need to be urgently scaled up, and those being implemented with any adaptations should be rigorously tested.",2021-12-01,Journal,Editorial,Reproductive Health,144680,6,18,Looking ahead in the COVID-19 pandemic: emerging lessons learned for sexual and reproductive health services in low- and middle-income countries,1,true,10.1186/s12978-021-01307-4,BioMed Central Ltd,Reproductive Health,2021.0,68.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'There was a reduction in access to SRH services, including family planning counselling and contraception access, and safe abortion during the early phase of the pandemic, especially when movement restrictions were in place, but services were quickly restored or alternatives to service provision (adaptations) were explored in many LMICs.'}",321,1405071454,A.

322,"© 2021 The AuthorsBackground: Primary prevention strategies are needed to reduce high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The effectiveness of population-based approaches may be improved by adding initiatives targeted at the most vulnerable groups and tailored to context-specificities. Methods: We applied a decision-tree approach to identify subgroups of women at higher risk of IPV in 48 LMICs and in all countries combined. Data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey carried out between 2010 and 2019 with available information on IPV and sociodemographic indicators was used. To create the trees, we selected 15 recognized risk factors for IPV in the literature which had a potential for targeting interventions. Exposure to IPV was defined as having experienced physical and/or sexual IPV in the past 12 months. Findings: In the pooled decision tree, witnessing IPV during childhood, a low or medium empowerment level and alcohol use by the partner were the strongest markers of IPV vulnerability. IPV prevalence amongst the most vulnerable women was 43% compared to 21% in the overall sample. This high-risk group included women who witnessed IPV during childhood and had lower empowerment levels. These were 12% of the population and 1 in 4 women who experienced IPV in the selected LMICs. Across the individual national trees, subnational regions emerged as the most frequent markers of IPV occurrence. Interpretation: Starting with well-known predictors of IPV, the decision-tree approach provides important insights about subpopulations of women where IPV prevalence is high. This information can help designing targeted interventions. For a large proportion of women who experienced IPV, however, no particular risk factors were identified, emphasizing the need for population wide approaches conducted in parallel, including changing social norms, strengthening laws and policies supporting gender equality and women´s rights as well as guaranteeing women´s access to justice systems and comprehensive health services.

323,"© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.Exposure to stigma, violence, sex work, and substance use are associated with increased HIV risk, but relationships between these factors have not been fully elucidated among transgender women whose data are often aggregated with men who have sex with men and other sexual and gender minorities. Considering this gap, we aimed to identify a serologically confirmed HIV estimate for transgender women and examine the relationships between stigma, sex work, substance use, and HIV among a national sample of transgender women in Dominican Republic. We analyzed biomarkers and self-report data from the third wave of Dominican Republic's Encuesta de Vigilancia y Comportamiento con Vinculación Serológica, employing logistic and negative binomial regression to estimate models (n = 307). HIV rate was 35.8%. Nearly 75% of respondents engaged in sex work. Over 20% reported experiencing violence; 61.6% reported being stigmatized. Participation in sex work was associated with higher levels of stigma [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.70, p < 0.05].

324,"© The Author(s) 2021.Violence against sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals has continued to proliferate globally. Yet, less is known about victimization among subgroups of SGM individuals, especially SGM immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. There has been a steady increase in this vulnerable group of migrants over the years, and emerging evidence has pointed to their heightened risk of victimization. We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature that examined violence, abuse, and mental health among SGM individuals who migrate internationally. One hundred ninety-nine articles were identified by searching five scholarly databases and hand searching. Twenty-six articles met inclusion criteria. We first used the migration framework, which outlines the distinct phases of the migration trajectory (predeparture, travel, interception, destination, and return), to categorize findings and then identified four overarching themes to capture SGM migrants’ experiences at each phase: severe and prolonged violence and abuse related to sexual orientation or gender identity (predeparture); continued victimization and high-risk for sexual violence (travel); detainment- and deportation-related violence and abuse (interception and return); and new manifestations of violence and abuse while living with past trauma (destination).

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseTransgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) individuals are at a high risk of adverse mental health outcomes due to minority stress—the stress faced by individuals categorised as stigmatised social minority groups. This systematic review sought to summarise the key mental health findings of the research on TGNC individuals in mainland China. We also aimed to consolidate research on the topic, identify specific mental health disparities, and offer new perspectives for future research to inform both policy and clinical practice. An extensive search of the literature, published in English and Chinese, was done between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 1, 2021, using PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Wanfang (in Chinese), and CNKI (in Chinese). Overall, two qualitative and 28 quantitative articles were identified. The quantitative findings showed a high prevalence of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and stress-related issues, and greater disparities in psychological wellbeing. High prevalence is also reported in suicidality and self-harm behaviours in this group. Across the two qualitative studies, attributable factors included gender-related discrimination, barriers to accessing health services, low social support, decreased knowledge and awareness of HIV prevention, and demographic characteristics—such as marital status, educational level, and gender identity. This Review also found little evidence of gender-affirming care and mental health interventions in mainland China. Following from these results, the next step is to integrate multi-level, social-psychological interventions with education to reduce cultural stereotypes and transphobia in mainland China. Political and social implications are also discussed to inform a standard set of guidelines for transgender-inclusive health-care services, including advocating for funding to create these special care programmes and services.",2021-12-01,Journal,Review,The Lancet Public Health,21100804406,3,6,The mental health of transgender and gender non-conforming people in China: a systematic review,1,true,10.1016/S2468-2667(21)00236-X,Elsevier Ltd,Lancet Public Health,2021.0,59.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The quantitative findings showed a high prevalence of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and stress-related issues, and greater disparities in psychological wellbeing in TGNC individuals in mainland China.'}",325,32273443,Yezhe Lin,145016686,Hui Xie,2156501110,Zimo Huang,14689966,Quan Zhang,153839784,Amanda Wilson,47287041,Jiaojiao Hou,27.0,99.0,5.0,37.0,298.0,10.0,8.0,38.0,2.0,18.0,55.0,5.0,44.0,471.0,9.0,6.0,53.0,4.0,Medicine

327,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdBackground: This study aimed to identify patterns of attempted suicide methods and risk factors in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other gender/sexual minority (LGBTQ+) youth by comparing them to non-LGBTQ+ youth. Methods: A total of 9281 Chinese college students completed the study, 8313 participants were included in the analysis of which 1032 were LGBTQ+ youth and 7281 were non-LGBTQ+ youth. Sociodemographic information was collected along with several scales and self-report items. This included anxiety scores using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, depression scores using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, mania score using the Altman Self-Rating Mania (ASRM), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) victimization using the World Health Organization's definition. Self-report items were used to further collect history of non-fatal self-injurious behaviors, parents' related risk factors, history of suicide attempts, and methods of attempted suicide. Results: The prevalence of attempted suicide in LGBTQ+ youth was 4.2%, which in comparison was more than four times higher than non-LGBTQ+ youth. LGBTQ+ youth 19–22 years old were at a significantly higher risk of attempting suicide than non-LGBTQ+ youth. The most common method of attempted suicide was cutting of the wrist, followed by jumping from a high height. There were some common suicide risk factors that were similar between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ youth, such as living in a rural area, having a history of a psychiatric disorder, and having a history of non-fatal self-injurious behaviors. The associated increased risk factors for LGBTQ+ youth were having a higher score for CTQ-emotional abuse and CTQ-sexual abuse. Limitation: The causality of risk factors to attempted suicide cannot be assumed due to the cross-sectional nature of the survey. Also, due to the relatively small sample size within the subgroups, we did not assess LGBTQ+ youth separately according to the different sexuality groups. Conclusion: LGBTQ+ youth showed a higher prevalence of attempted suicide when compared to their heterosexual peers. Emotional and sexual abuse showed higher rates among LGBTQ+ youth, the cumulative effects of childhood trauma might explain the difficulties in developing healthy coping styles.",2021-12-01,Journal,Article,Child Abuse and Neglect,24451,3,122,Methods of attempted suicide and risk factors in LGBTQ+ youth,0,false,10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105352,Elsevier Ltd,International Journal of Child Abuse & Neglect,2021.0,73.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'LGBT+ youth showed a higher prevalence of attempted suicide when compared to their heterosexual peers, and emotional and sexual abuse showed higher rates among LGBTQ+ youth, the cumulative effects of childhood trauma might explain the difficulties in developing healthy coping styles.'}",327,2146024386,Yuanyuan Wang,1690908036,Yi Feng,151116464,Mengxue Han,82973009,Zhizhou Duan,153839784,Amanda Wilson,46429727,J.

328,"© 2021 Society for the Study of AddictionBackground and aims: Although men's alcohol misuse and less gender-equitable attitudes have been identified as risks for perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV), less is known about how men's gender-equitable attitudes and drinking act together to increase risk of IPV. This study aimed to assess the independent relationships of lower gender-equitable attitudes and drinking to perpetration of IPV and their interaction among men in seven countries. Design: Secondary analysis of the United Nations Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence (UNMCS) and Nabilan Study databases consisting of (1) unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression to measure the association of perpetration of IPV with gender-equitable men (GEM) scale score and regular heavy episodic drinking (RHED) and (2) meta-analyses of prevalence and effect estimates adjusted for country-level sites and countries. Setting and participants: A total of 9148 ever-partnered 18–49-year-old men surveyed in 2011–15 from 18 sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and Timor Leste. Measurements: The outcome variable is reported perpetration of physical or sexual IPV in the previous year. Independent variables: GEM scale scores; RHED, defined as six or more drinks in one session at least monthly (compared with other drinkers and abstainers). Findings: Pooled past-year prevalence of perpetration of IPV was 13% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 9–16%]. GEM scores and RHED were independently associated with perpetration of IPV overall and in most sites. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for perpetration of IPV with less equitable GEM scores were 1.07 (95% CI = 1.04, 1.09) and with RHED were 3.42 (95% CI = 2.43, 4.81). A significant interaction between GEM score and RHED (P = 0.001) indicated that RHED increased the relationship of less gender-equitable attitudes and perpetration of IPV.

329,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Violence against women (VAW) is a global challenge, and the health sector is a key entry point for survivors to receive care. The World Health Organization adopted an earlier framework for health systems response to survivors. However, documentation on the programmatic rollout of health system response to violence against women is lacking in low and middle-income countries. This paper studies the programmatic roll out of the health systems response across select five low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and identifies key learnings. Methods: We selected five LMIC settings with recent or active programming on national-level health system response to VAW from 2015 to 2020. We synthesized publicly available data and program reports according to the components of the WHO Health Systems Framework. The countries selected are Bangladesh, Brazil, Nepal, Rwanda, and Sri Lanka. Results: One-stop centers were found to be the dominant model of care located in hospitals in four countries. Each setting has implemented in-service training as key to addressing provider knowledge, attitudes and practice; however, significant gaps remain in addressing frequent staff turnover, provision of training at scale, and documentation of the impact of training. The health system protocols for VAW address sexual violence but do not uniformly include clinical and health policy responses for emotional or economic violence. Providing privacy to survivors within health facilities was a universal challenge. Conclusion: Significant efforts have been made to address provider attitudes towards provision of care and to protocolize delivery of care to survivors, primarily through one-stop centers. Further improvements can be made in data collection on training impact on provider attitudes and practices, in provider identification of VAW survivors, and in prioritization of VAW within health system budgeting, staffing, and political priorities. Primary health facilities need to provide first-line support for survivors to avoid delays in response to all forms of VAW as well as for secondary prevention.",2021-12-01,Journal,Article,BMC Women's Health,19499,1,21,Mapping the health systems response to violence against women: key learnings from five LMIC settings (2015–2020),1,true,10.1186/s12905-021-01499-8,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Women's Health,2021.0,75.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Significant efforts have been made to address provider attitudes towards provision of care and to protocolize delivery of care to survivors, primarily through one-stop centers, and key learnings are identified.'}",329,6506972,S.

This review examined and evaluated recent literature regarding the influence of sex and gender on obesity prevalence, comorbidities, and treatment in adults. Recent Findings: Obesity is more prevalent in women than men in most countries, but in some countries and population subgroups, this gap is more pronounced. Several obesity-related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension, demonstrate sex-specific pathways. Women, compared to men, are more likely to be diagnosed with obesity and seek and obtain all types of obesity treatment including behavioral, pharmacological, and bariatric surgery. Men tend to have greater absolute weight loss, but this difference is attenuated once accounting for baseline weight. Summary: Obesity is a multifactorial condition with complex interactions among sex/gender, sociocultural, environmental, and physiological factors.

332,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: The use of electronic media is widespread among young people and is a potential tool for the perpetration of intimate-partner violence (IPV) towards women. The aim of this study is to validate two questions focused on harassment and control by electronic tools (HCE-2) as a screening tool for the detection of IPV in young women. Methods: The data source was the third Community of Madrid IPV survey in 2014. The screening tool consisted of two questions with five possible answers prepared by a group of experts. As the gold standard we used the definition of intimate partner violence based on a 26- question survey. The validity indices (with 95% confidence intervals) were compared between two age groups: 18–24 and 25–29 years. Results: Six hundred ninty-four women were sampled. The response rate was 68.7%, and 477 surveys were analyzed. The prevalence of IPV was 10.7% (95% CI: 8.2–13.8). HCE-2 was positive in 5.9% (95% CI: 4.1–8.4). The overall efficiency of the test was 93.5% (95% CI: 91.1–96.7), sensitivity 47.1% (95% CI: 33.7–60.8), specificity 99.1% (95% CI: 97.5–99.6), and positive predictive value 85.7% (95% CI: 67.1–94.6).

333,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: The war in Syria caused the forced displacement of millions of Syrians to neighboring countries. Lebanon is the host country with the largest overall number of Syrian refugees per capita. Adolescent refugee girls experience a unique level of vulnerability during human emergencies and are at increased risk of suffering from poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study to learn about the SRH perceptions and experiences of refugee adolescent girls living in Bourj Hammoud, an urban setting in Lebanon. Methods: We employed a qualitative design with eight focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted with 40 Syrian Arab and Syrian Kurdish adolescent girls between January and March 2020. Every FGD consisted of five participants aged 13 to 17 years. A semi-structured guide was used covering multiple themes: menstruation, puberty, SRH awareness, and sexual harassment. FGDs were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: The participants discussed adolescent girls’ health and named six elements of good health, such as healthy activities and self-protection. The majority of the FGD participants reported a lack of awareness about menstruation when they experienced it for the first time and the social stigma associated with menstruation. When defining puberty, they indicated its social link to a girl’s readiness for marriage and her need to become cautious about sexual harassment. Most FGD participants had very poor knowledge of the female reproductive system. Mothers were the most approached persons to receive information on SRH issues; however, the girls indicated a wish to receive advice from specialists in a comfortable and private atmosphere. All the girls reported that either they themselves, or an acquaintance, had experienced some type of sexual harassment. The girls rarely reported those incidents due to fear of being blamed or subjected to mobility restrictions, or forced to drop out of school.

334,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment is a major global priority. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Building the Resilience of Vulnerable Communities in Burkina Faso (BRB) project, an agricultural development program, improved women’s empowerment, as measured by the project-level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI). Methods: This study used a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study design. Participants included both treatment and comparison groups (total N = 751) comprising female members of savings groups and their husbands or main male household member in Burkina Faso. All participants completed the pro-WEAI questionnaire at both baseline and endline. The treatment group received a comprehensive intervention package consisting of agriculture loans and services, microenterprise loans, and education, nutrition education, and women’s empowerment programs including gender-based discussions designed to facilitate personalized changes in gender relations. Results: The proportion of the treatment group achieving empowerment did not change from baseline for women, but improved substantially for men. Women from the comparison group saw an increase in empowerment at endline while men saw a substantial decrease. Gender parity was high for women in both groups at baseline and increased slightly at endline. Women were more likely to have adequate empowerment in input in productive decisions, group membership, and membership in influential groups than men while men were more likely to have adequate empowerment in attitudes about domestic violence, control over use of income, and work balance than women. Participants from the treatment group reported an increase in the average number of empowerment indicators that they were adequate in while the comparison group saw a decrease in average adequacy over time (p = 0.002) after controlling for age, sex, and level of education. Conclusion: Despite starting at an empowerment disadvantage, the treatment group experienced gains in individual indicators of empowerment while the comparison group men and women experienced mixed results, with the women gaining, and the men losing empowerment.

335,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Few studies explore what it means to be an adolescent parent in the Philippines from the young parents’ perspective. This study sought to improve understanding of how adolescent mothers and young fathers experienced pregnancy in Palawan, Philippines. Methods: We conducted narrative analysis of 27 semi-structured interviews with 15 Filipino young parents. Findings: Our findings point to three pathways to adolescent pregnancy differentiated by life circumstances and perceived self-efficacy: through early unions, through ‘disgrasya’ (accident) in romantic relationships, and when pregnancy is directly related to adversity and disadvantage. Some young people adopted agentic narratives and had intended pregnancies within early unions. Young people who had unintended pregnancies in romantic relationships recounted constrained choice narratives, taking responsibility for their decisions while emphasising external factors’ influence on their decision-making. Other young mothers described the ways that prior adversity and disadvantage gave rise to unfavourable circumstances—including sexual violence—that led to unintended pregnancy but shared narratives showing how they had reclaimed agency in their lives. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need to (1) address underlying poverty and structural inequalities that limit Filipino young people’s life choices and contribute to their pathways to adolescent pregnancy; (2) provide Filipino young people with access to essential sexual and reproductive health information, services, and supplies; and (3) change social norms to rectify gender-based power imbalances and sexual violence. This study sought to improve understanding of how adolescent mothers and young fathers experienced adolescent pregnancy in Palawan, Philippines. By analysing the narratives of 15 Filipino young parents, we found three pathways to adolescent pregnancy differentiated by life circumstances and perceived self-efficacy: intended pregnancy through early, cohabiting unions; unintended pregnancy through ‘disgrasya’ (accident) in romantic relationships; and unintended pregnancy following prior difficult life circumstances where pregnancy led to reclaiming of agency. Our findings highlight the need to address poverty and inequalities, ensure that Filipino adolescents have access to sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies, and change social norms that perpetuate gender-based power imbalances and sexual violence.",2021-12-01,Journal,Article,Reproductive Health,144680,0,18,"Early union, ‘disgrasya’, and prior adversity and disadvantage: pathways to adolescent pregnancy among Filipino youth",1,true,10.1186/s12978-021-01163-2,BioMed Central Ltd,Reproductive Health,2021.0,100.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Three pathways to adolescent pregnancy differentiated by life circumstances and perceived self-efficacy are found: intended pregnancy through early, cohabiting unions; unintended pregnancy through ‘ disgrasya ’ (accident) in romantic relationships; and unintended pregnancy following prior difficult life circumstances where pregnancy led to reclaiming of agency.'}",335,7311379,C.

336,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Femicide is a very important public health problem in Ecuador. Since regional and country-level femicide rates can obscure significant variations at the sub-national level, it is important to provide information at the lowest relevant level of disaggregation to be able to develop targeted preventive policies. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial distribution of the femicide rate and to examine its spatial clustering at the canton level in Ecuador in the period 2018–2019. Methods: Data on cases were collected by a national network of non-governmental organizations. Two age-disaggregated analyses were done, one for the 15 to 24 years-olds and the other for the female population of 15 and older. Age-specific population data were obtained from the National Institute of Statistics for the study period. Standardized mortality ratios for mapping the mortality were calculated using hierarchical Bayesian models and spatial scan statistics were applied to identify local clusters. Thematic maps of age-specific femicide rates were also constructed. Results: During the two-year period, 61 and 183 women were killed in the age ranges 15–24 and 15 years and older, respectively. The annual rate of femicides in Ecuador was 1.0 and 0.8 per 100,000 in the female population aged 15–24 and 15+, respectively, with substantial variations among cantons. The spatial analysis contributed to visualize high risk cantons, which were mainly located in a small area in the central part of the country (for those 15+) but especially in the Amazon region, for both of the studied age groups. Conclusions: This study has shown the usefulness of applying spatial analysis to the problem of femicides in Ecuador. The study has revealed important variations among cantons but also a spatial clustering, mainly in the Amazon region of the country. The results should help policymakers to focus on current prevention programmes for violence against women into these high-risk areas.

337,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Violence risk assessment is a routine part of clinical services in mental health, and in particular secure psychiatric hospitals. The use of prediction models and risk tools can assist clinical decision-making on risk management, including decisions about further assessments, referral, hospitalization and treatment. In recent years, scalable evidence-based tools, such as Forensic Psychiatry and Violent Oxford (FoVOx), have been developed and validated for patients with mental illness. However, their acceptability and utility in clinical settings is not known. Therefore, we conducted a clinical impact study in multiple institutions that provided specialist mental health service. Methods: We followed a two-step mixed-methods design. In phase one, we examined baseline risk factors on 330 psychiatric patients from seven forensic psychiatric institutes in China. In phase two, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 clinicians regarding violence risk assessment from ten mental health centres. We compared the FoVOx score on each admission (n = 110) to unstructured clinical risk assessment and used a thematic analysis to assess clinician views on the accuracy and utility of this tool. Results: The median estimated probability of violent reoffending (FoVOx score) within 1 year was 7% (range 1–40%). There was fair agreement (72/99, 73% agreement) on the risk categories between FoVOx and clinicians’ assessment on risk categories, and moderate agreement (10/12, 83% agreement) when examining low and high risk categories. In a majority of cases (56/101, 55%), clinicians thought the FoVOx score was an accurate representation of the violent risk of an individual patient. Clinicians suggested some additional clinical, social and criminal risk factors should be considered during any comprehensive assessment. In addition, FoVOx was considered to be helpful in assisting clinical decision-making and individual risk assessment. Ten out of 11 clinicians reported that FoVOx was easy to use, eight out of 11 was practical, and all clinicians would consider using it in the future. Conclusions: Clinicians found that violence risk assessment could be improved by using a simple, scalable tool, and that FoVOx was feasible and practical to use.",2021-12-01,Journal,Article,BMC Psychiatry,14260,5,21,Assessment of violence risk in 440 psychiatric patients in China: examining the feasibility and acceptability of a novel and scalable approach (FoVOx),1,true,10.1186/s12888-021-03115-3,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Psychiatry,2021.0,29.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Clinicians found that violence risk assessment could be improved by using a simple, scalable tool, and that FoVOx was feasible and practical to use.'}",337,52193079,S.

338,"© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) undermines HIV prevention and treatment cascades, particularly among women who report partner violence. Screening for violence during HIV testing, and prior to offering pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to HIV uninfected women, provides an opportunity to identify those at heightened HIV risk and greater potential for non-adherence or early discontinuation of PrEP. The paper describes our experience with offering integrated GBV screening and referral as part of HIV counselling and testing. This component was implemented within EMPOWER, a demonstration project offering combination HIV prevention, including daily oral PrEP, to young women in South Africa and Tanzania. Methods: Between February 2017 and March 2018, a process evaluation was conducted to explore views, experiences and practices of stakeholders (study participants and study clinical staff) during implementation of the GBV screening component. This article assesses the feasibility and acceptability of the approach from multiple stakeholder perspectives, drawing on counselling session observations (n = 10), in-depth interviews with participants aged 16–24 (n = 39) and clinical staff (n = 13), and notes from debriefings with counsellors. Study process data were also collected (e.g. number of women screened and referred). Following a thematic inductive approach, qualitative data were analysed using qualitative software (NVivo 11). Results: Findings show that 31% of young women screened positive for GBV and only 10% requested referrals. Overall, study participants accessing PrEP were amenable to being asked about violence during HIV risk assessment, as this offered the opportunity to find emotional relief and seek help, although a few found this traumatic. In both sites, the sensitive and empathetic approach of the staff helped mitigate distress of GBV disclosure. In general, the delivery of GBV screening in HCT proved to be feasible, provided that the basic principles of confidentiality, staff empathy, and absence of judgment were observed. However, uptake of linkage to further care remained low in both sites. Conclusion: Most stakeholders found GBV screening acceptable and feasible.

339,"© 2021, The Author(s).Social struggles have led to the legal recognition of the rights of LGTBI+ people in some countries. Even so, violence against LGTBI+ people is a social problem throughout the world, and has resulted in the vulnerability and victimization of the members of this group. In Spain, no research has been published to date that analyzes this problem in the university context. Considering the scarcity of studies on the identification of this type of violence in Spain, the main objective of this study was to identify violence against LGBTI+ people in Catalan universities. We administered a battery of questions to a sample of 571 university students from six universities in Catalonia (77.8% women) between 17 and 55 years old (M = 21.0; SD = 3.96). Of the 12 situations of violence presented, psychological violence was identified as the most common type. Within our sample, 61.0% reported either being aware of or having experienced some type of violence related to the university context and motivated by the sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression of the victim. The results also show that these types of violence in the university context are rarely reported, especially when they do not include physical violence.

340,"© 2021, The Author(s).Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic affects maternal health both directly and indirectly, and direct and indirect effects are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. Results: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. Conclusion: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies. Plain English summary: The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.",2021-12-01,Journal,Review,Reproductive Health,144680,206,18,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal health: a scoping review,1,true,10.1186/s12978-021-01070-6,BioMed Central Ltd,Reproductive Health,2020.0,118.0,10.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for CO VID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences.'}",340,6109854,B.

Objectives: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with physical punishment and psychological aggression toward children (1 - 14 years of age) in Laos. Methods: In the nationally representative 2017 Lao Social Indicator Survey, 20,949 mothers or caretakers of children aged 1 - 14 years responded to questions on child disciplining methods used by adults in households during the past month and attitudes toward violence. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between household and maternal characteristics and physical punishment and psychological aggression toward children. Results: The prevalence of psychological aggression was 64.0% (shouted, etc., 60.5% and called child dumb, etc., 26.4%), the prevalence of any physical punishment was 35.6% (spanked, etc., 27.1%, hit on extremities 23.9%, hit on the bottom, etc., 4.9%, hit on face 3.9%, and “beat the child as hard as one could” 1.0%).

342,"© 2020, The Author(s).Background: Women’s empowerment, and maternal and neonatal health are important targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. Our objective is to examine the relationship between women’s empowerment and elective cesarean section (ECS), focusing on Vietnam, a country where the use of CS has increased rapidly in recent decades, which raises public health concerns. Methods: We hypothesized that in the context of the developing biomedicalization of childbirth, women’s empowerment increases the use of ECS due to a woman’s enhanced ability to decide her mode of delivery. By using microdata from the 2013–2014 Multiple Indicator Clusters Survey, we conducted a multivariate analysis of the correlates of ECS. We studied a representative sample of 1343 institutional single birth deliveries. Due to higher ECS rates among multiparous (18.4%) than primiparous women (10.1%) and the potential interaction between parity and other correlates, we used separate models for primiparous and multiparous women. Results: Among the indicators of women’s external resources, which include a higher level of education, having worked during the previous 12 months, and having one’s own mobile phone, only education differed between primiparous and multiparous women, with a higher level among primiparous women. Among primiparous women, no resource indicator was significantly linked to ECS. However, considering women’s empowerment facilitated the identification of the negative impact of having had fewer than 3 antenatal care visits on the use of ECS. Among multiparous women, disapproval of intimate partner violence (IPV) was associated with a doubled likelihood of undergoing ECS (odds ratio = 2.415), and living in an urban area also doubled the likelihood of ECS. The positive association with living in the richest household quintile was no longer significant when attitude towards IPV was included in the model. In both groups, being aged 35 or older increased the likelihood of undergoing ECS, and this impact was stronger in primiparous women. Conclusions: These results underline the multidimensionality of empowerment, its links to other correlates and its contribution to clarifying the influence of these correlates, particularly for distinguishing between medical and sociocultural determinants.

343,"© 2020, The Author(s).Background: A health system response to domestic violence against women is a global priority. However, little is known about how these health system interventions work in low-and-middle-income countries where there are greater structural barriers. Studies have failed to explore how context-intervention interactions affect implementation processes. Healthcare Responding to Violence and Abuse aimed to strengthen the primary healthcare response to domestic violence in occupied Palestinian territory. We explored the adaptive work that participants engaged in to negotiate contextual constraints. Methods: The qualitative study involved 18 participants at two primary health care clinics and included five women patients, seven primary health care providers, two clinic case managers, two Ministry of Health based gender-based violence focal points and two domestic violence trainers. Semi-structured interviews were used to elicit participants’ experiences of engaging with HERA, challenges encountered and how these were negotiated. Data were analysed using thematic analysis drawing on Extended Normalisation Process Theory. We collected clinic data on identification and referral of domestic violence cases and training attendance. Results: HERA interacted with political, sociocultural and economic aspects of the context in Palestine. The political occupation restricted women’s movement and access to support services, whilst the concomitant lack of police protection left providers and women feeling exposed to acts of family retaliation. This was interwoven with cultural values that influenced participants’ choices as they negotiated normative structures that reinforce violence against women. Participants engaged in adaptive work to negotiate these challenges and ensure that implementation was safe and workable. Narratives highlight the use of subterfuge, hidden forms of agency, governing behaviours, controls over knowledge and discretionary actions. The care pathway did not work as anticipated, as most women chose not to access external support. An emergent feature of the intervention was the ability of the clinic case managers to improvise their role.

Linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between SO-DV experiences and mental health outcomes. Physical violence was reported less frequently than the other forms of SO-DV. As the number of settings in which SO-DV were experienced increased, a stronger association with negative mental health outcomes was observed. Experiences of subtle SO-DV were associated with increased distress, lower vitality, and increased risk of suicidal ideation. Disapproval of gender nonconformity was associated with negative mental health outcomes independently of violence based on sexual orientation.

Published by BMJ.Introduction While current research on sexuality and health often explores sexual behaviours among heterosexual and gay cisgender individuals, little is known about the sexualities of transgender people, especially transmasculine people. When data are available, sexual health is often reduced to risk exposure, not considering in detail social context and determinants that could contribute to a more comprehensive approach, such as general health, class, race, exposure to violence or social representations. Recognising this gap, identified in both national (French) and international scientific literature, this study aims to explore the sexual health of transmasculine people, employing an intersectional approach and considering both positive and negative health determinants.

346,"Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.Aim Being subjected to childhood maltreatment has devastating long-Term adverse effects and is a major risk factor for mental health problems in adult life. There is empirical support that socio-political factors can be risk factors for childhood maltreatment. Here we examine whether socio-political context predicts self-rated childhood maltreatment in a sample of the German population. Methods Data were drawn from surveys of representative samples of the East and West German population, including participants born 1980 or earlier (5836 participants; 3146 women). Childhood maltreatment was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Screener, the German short screening version of the childhood trauma questionnaire. To examine whether socio-political context is a predictor of childhood maltreatment in women and men, we conducted logistic regression analyses. Results We found that in women, socio-political context (West Germany) significantly predicted childhood maltreatment (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.7 [1.2-2.5], 1.6 [1.1-2.3], 2.5 [1.6-4.1] and 1.8 [1.3-2.5] for emotional neglect, and emotional, physical and sexual violence, respectively). In men, the socio-political context (West Germany) was a predictor of physical and sexual violence (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.8 [1.2-2.7] and 2.5 [1.4-4.5]), respectively. Concerning emotional neglect and violence, socio-political context was not a significant predictor in men. The examination of differential item functioning revealed that our results could not be attributed to differential response behaviour between East and West Germans caused by item bias. Conclusions The results suggest that socio-political context is an important determinant to consider when examining childhood maltreatment. Future research should continue to focus on risk and protective factors at the societal level, such as legal frameworks addressing gender equality and child protection laws, to create further evidence for population-wide prevention strategies ensuring safe, nurturing and thriving environments for children and families.",2021-11-18,Journal,Article,Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences,19900192160,4,30,Socio-political context as determinant of childhood maltreatment: A population-based study among women and men in East and West Germany,1,true,10.1017/S2045796021000585,Cambridge University Press,Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences,2021.0,40.0,1.0,,346,6582774,C.

This paper draws on the findings of a study that considered both the experiences of women seafarers working in the UK shipping industry and the views of key industry stakeholder representatives, and asks what must be done to improve those experiences? Responses across the industry suggest that all women seafarers will experience some form of harassment during their careers, which has significant implications for their occupational health, safety and wellbeing. These experiences reflect failures of leadership in developing and promoting a safe and inclusive onboard culture. This paper calls for fundamental change within the industry, including improvements in training and leadership to reflect modern seafaring and diversity on board. It also calls for relevant policy and strategic changes to be based on the views of seafarers and their representatives.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: Studying prosociality in children is a complex but relevant issue related to the qualitative development of human interactions. The main objective of the present study is to identify the psychosocial factors that most promote or inhibit the adoption of prosocial behaviours among children. Method: In Spring 2021, a survey was conducted amongst primary school children through a structured paper questionnaire. The data analysis has been carried out through bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Path analysis has been used. Results: The results highlight the role played by the parental education level, the perception of positive and negative emotions, the adherence to gender roles and the involvement in cyberbullying actions in predicting prosocial tendencies among children. On the other hand, adopting prosocial behaviours affects the screen-time as well as the devices’ interference in face-to-face interactions and the attitude towards school. Conclusions: The results are relevant and useful for the study of trends in prosocial behaviours among children. Family education level, individual status, peer interactions and social conditionings are variables that highly influence this multidimensional phenomenon. Further research is needed, including the definition of new measures and indicators concerning the context where children live and interact with others, with the aim of designing interventions aimed at facilitating relational well-being of children.",2021-11-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,3,18,The impact of socialisation on children’s prosocial behaviour.

Aims: This work aimed to determine the relationship between violence, jealousy, and ambivalent sexism according to emotional dependence in adolescent student couples. Methods: A cross-sectional study. A total of 234 Spanish adolescents (69.7% female, Mage = 16.77, SD = 1.11) participated in the study. Participants completed an ad hoc interview and several validated tests (Partner’s Emotional Dependency Scale, the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, the Jealousy subscale of the Love Addiction Scale, the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationship Inventory). Results: Of the sample, 40.6% indicated high emotional dependence and 14.5% extreme emotional dependence. Differences were observed according to gender (t = 3.92, p < 0.001), with adolescent boys scoring higher than adolescent girls. Extremely emotionally dependent participants showed differences in both violence (sexual, relational, verbal, and physical) and ambivalent sexism (hostile, benevolent) and jealousy scores. Generating a predictive model of emotional dependence, with the variable jealousy and ambivalent sexism as predictor variables, it was found that jealousy has the greatest predictive and major explanatory capacity (R2 = 0.297); with an R2 = 0.334. However, the contribution of the ASI-Hostile subscale was not significant when the ASI-Benevolent subscale was introduced into the model. Further, in a second model where the scores on jealousy and the couple conflict inventory’s subscales were considered as predictors, are again jealousy makes the greatest predictive contribution and shows the greatest explanatory capacity (R2 = 0.296). It was found that the contribution is significant only for the predictive capacity of Sexual Violence and Relational Violence. In this sense, the educational context is one of the propitious places to detect and correct behaviors that may be indicative of potentially unbalanced and unbalancing relationships for adolescents.",2021-11-01,Journal,Article,Children,21101055706,2,8,"Jealousy, violence, and sexual ambivalence in adolescent students according to emotional dependency in the couple relationship",1,true,10.3390/children8110993,MDPI,Children,2021.0,69.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A predictive model of emotional dependence in adolescent student couples, with the variable jealousy and ambivalent sexism as predictor variables, found that jealousy has the greatest predictive and major explanatory capacity.'}",350,35664822,F.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Female sex workers (FSWs) are at increased risk of mental health problems, including mood disorders and substance abuse, and we need to understand the origins of these to treat and prevent them, and particularly understand how the context in which they sell sex impacts their mental health. We conducted a multi-stage, community-centric, cross-sectional survey of 3005 FSWs linked to SW programmes in twelve sites across all nine provinces of South Africa. We interviewed adult women who had sold sex in the preceding six months, who were recruited via SW networks. We found that FSWs have very poor mental health as 52.7% had depression and 53.6% has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The structural equation model showed direct pathways from childhood trauma and having HIV+ status to mental ill-health. Indirect pathways were mediated by food insecurity, controlling partners, non-partner rape, harmful alcohol use, substance use to cope with SW, indicators of the circumstances of SW, i.e., selling location (on streets, in taverns and brothels), frequency of selling and experiencing SW stigma. All paths from childhood trauma had final common pathways from exposure to gender-based violence (non-partner rape or intimate partner violence) to mental ill-health, except for one that was mediated by food insecurity. Thus, FSWs’ poor mental health risk was often mediated by their work location and vulnerability to violence, substance abuse and stigma. The potential contribution of legal reform to mitigate the risks of violence and mental ill-health are inescapable.

Whereas most poverty research disregards gender and exclusively analyzes average income or the expected probability of being poor, we depart from these approaches by examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families. Focusing on identifying heterogeneous effects according to the sex of the household head, we apply additive quantile models to a cross-sectional dataset containing information on 4,434 women-headed and 14,877 men-headed households. For each model, we introduce 45 variables at the individual/household, community, and regional levels. Two major contributions emerge from this paper. First, the identification of a subset of significant factors whose effect is independent of the head’s sex and is relevant for poor and extremely poor families. This is found for the variables credit card ownership, access to basic housing services, education level, and satisfaction with public services. Second, results also identify a subset of significant factors with an uneven effect on income according to the sex of the head that is observed both in the poor and extremely poor households. Variables having this gendered effect are the community’s income inequality, municipal human development, social networks, access to social security, and gender-based violence against women in the public sphere. Out of these, particularly relevant is the effect of the last three factors, whose association with income has not been explored before for rural Mexico and for which the bias among sexes increases as family income grows from extreme poverty to poverty level.",2021-11-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,16,Examining gender inequalities in factors associated with income poverty in Mexican rural households,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0259187,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2021.0,64.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families in Mexico identifies a subset of significant factors whose effect is independent of the head’s sex and is relevant for poor andextremely poor families.'}",352,2139542559,Juan Armando Torres Munguía,1393695891,I.

Measurement equivalence was confirmed by gender. The latent means differences showed no statistically significant differences by teachers’ gender. The TCEB correlation with school environment factors (e.g., principal support, school climate, and bullying) confirms the scale’s discriminant and concurrent validity.

Four bibliographic databases were explored and references in included articles were searched. We identified 727 articles and retained 66 that met inclusion criteria. Research has identified multiple risk factors which have been associated with increased suicide risk in general (mental health problems, substance abuse, loneliness, stress, sexual orientation/gender identity issues and violent behaviors).

Fewer studies concern protective factors. School connectedness, restrictive style of parenting, parental support, life satisfaction, having a healthy diet, personal skills and having family dinners were associated with less risk of suicidal and self-harm behaviors following cyberbullying.

358,"© 2021 The Author(s)Background: Sexualised drug use (SDU) has been identified as a major risk factor for HIV, as well as other mental health comorbidities among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). While multiple studies have been conducted on the topic, few have explored the role of trauma in underpinning experiences of SDU among substance use treatment-experienced GBMSM. This qualitative study investigates life histories of trauma, and proposes a framework to better situate the factors driving SDU among treatment-experienced GBMSM. Methods: We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 33 purposively-sampled GBMSM with a history of SDU, and seeking treatment for it in Singapore. Interview topics included participants’ experiences and life histories of SDU, substance use, incarceration, trauma, as well as stories of resilience and ongoing recovery from SDU. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis, from which a trauma-informed framework was developed. Results: Participants firstly articulated the positive and desired aspects of SDU, such as its utility in allowing them to achieve positive emotional states, sexual enhancement, and feelings of connectedness and intimacy. Participants also described how SDU, in contrast, was used as a coping mechanism to deal with emotional and situational ‘precipitants’, including dealing with loneliness and a low self-esteem, sexual shame and social anxiety, as well as general stressful situations. Participants also articulated how such precipitants were underpinned by experiences of trauma, including those relating to HIV-related stigma, racism, sexual violence, death and loss, neglect, as well as internalised homophobia.

359,"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This study explores ways in which diverse LGBTQI+ claim frames are sedimented in Greek everyday discourse. Specifically, it is interested in the identification of the argumentative resources that inform lay constructions of LGBTQI+ claims and rights, as well as of their potential social implications. The research data are drawn from seven focus groups, conducted in Thessaloniki, Greece and analysed by the conceptual tools of Critical Discursive Social Psychology. According to the analysis, liberal dilemmas over difference, visibility, and equality are mobilized. In particular, when accounting for violence and discriminations against LGBTQI+ community members, participants construct a normative hierarchy of exclusion, based on alleged differences between sexual and gender-related categories. Notably, in the context of arguing over different claim-making practices, participants prioritize the projection of uniformity – instead of difference – through non-provocative, consensual claiming actions. While liberal concepts and subsequent dilemmas inform these constructions, “liberalism” is also represented as the rhetorical other, when participants prioritize intersectional claims over (sexual and gender-related) identity politics. Finally, participants' discourse is informed by tensions between oriental and occidental ideological patterns.

360,"© 2021, Society for Prevention Research.Machine learning creates new opportunities to design digital health interventions for youth at risk for acquiring HIV (YARH), capitalizing on YARH’s health information seeking on the internet. To date, researchers have focused on descriptive analyses that associate individual factors with health-seeking behaviors, without estimating of the strength of these predictive models. We developed predictive models by applying machine learning methods (i.e., elastic net and lasso regression models) to YARH’s self-reports of internet use. The YARH were aged 14–24 years old (N = 1287) from Los Angeles and New Orleans. Models were fit to three binary indicators of YARH’s lifetime internet searches for general health, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and social service information. YARH responses regarding internet health information seeking were fed into machine learning models with potential predictor variables based on findings from previous research, including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and gender minority identity, healthcare access and engagement, sexual behavior, substance use, and mental health. About half of the YARH reported seeking general health and SRH information and 26% sought social service information. Areas under the ROC curve (≥.75) indicated strong predictive models and results were consistent with the existing literature. For example, higher education and sexual minority identification was associated with seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. New findings also emerged. Cisgender identity versus transgender and non-binary identities was associated with lower odds of general health, SRH, and social service information seeking. Experiencing intimate partner violence was associated with higher odds of seeking general health, SRH, and social service information.

361,"© 2021 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of AndrologyBackground: Vaginoplasty is a gender-affirming procedure for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients who experience gender incongruence. This procedure reduces mental health concerns and enhances patients’ quality of life. A systematic review investigating the sexual health outcomes of vaginoplasty has not been performed. Objectives: To investigate sexual health after gender-affirming vaginoplasty for TGD patients. Data Sources: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases were searched, unrestricted by dates or study design. Methods: We included primary literature that incorporated TGD patients, reported sexual health outcomes after vaginoplasty intervention and were available in English. Outcomes included at least one of these sexual health parameters: sexual desire, arousal, sensation, activity, secretions, satisfaction, pleasure, orgasm, interferences, or aids. Results: Our search yielded 140 studies with 12 different vaginoplasty surgical techniques and 6,953 patients. The majority of these studies were cross-section or retrospective cohort observational studies (66%). 17.4%–100% (median 79.7%) of patients (n = 2,384) were able to orgasm postoperatively regardless of revision or primary vaginoplasty techniques. Female Sexual Function Index was the most used standardized questionnaire (17 studies, ranging from 16.9 to 28.6). 64%–98% (median 81%) of patients were satisfied with their general sexual satisfaction. The most common interference of sexual activity was dyspareunia. Conclusions: The heterogenous methods of measuring sexual outcomes reflect the difficulty in comparing single-center surgical outcomes, encouraging the need for a standardized and validated metric for reporting sexual health after vaginoplasty for TGD patients. The most common sexual health parameter reported is sexual activity while therapeutic aids and pleasure were the least reported parameters. Future studies are needed to improve and expand methods of measuring sexual health, including prospective studies, validated questionnaires, and inclusive metrics.

Participants were recruited from a local MSM-friendly health consulting center. This study used the adjusted Intimate Partner Violence Scale among Gay and Bisexual Men (IPV-GBM scale) to capture lifetime IPV experiences including physical, sexual and emotional violence, monitoring, and controlling behaviors. Among 431 participants, 153 (35.5%) reported any IPV experiences, and 119 (27.6%) reported themselves as being the perpetrator. Adjusted logistic regression models revealed that having been engaged in transactional sex was positively associated with victimization through monitoring behaviors (adjusted odds ratio [ORa] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval CI = [1.7, 7.4]) and perpetration of monitoring behaviors (ORa = 3.9, 95% CI = [1.5, 13.3]); drug use was positively associated with victimization through controlling behaviors (unadjusted odds ratio [ORu] = 2.5, 95% CI = [1.2, 5.0]) and emotional violence (ORa = 1.9, 95% CI = [1.0, 3.5]); older age (≥18 years) of first homosexual intercourse was negatively associated with perpetration of physical violence (ORu = 0.3, 95% CI = [0.2, 0.7]) and sexual violence (ORu = 0.4, 95% CI = [0.2, 1.0]); higher self-esteem was negatively associated with both victimization and perpetration of sexual and emotional violence. We found that victimization and perpetration experiences were correlated in all dimensions of IPV. Violence was prevalent among MSM and merits public attention.

Based on Theory of Normative Conduct, we hypothesized that higher classroom levels of TDV perpetration were associated with a higher likelihood of individual TDV perpetration. Data were drawn from a large survey of ninth-grade students conducted in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany (n = 10,638). From this sample, an analysis sample of n = 4,351 students at risk was drawn (mean age: 15.0, SD: 0.76; 46.6% male). More than half (54.8%) of the at-risk sample reported engagement in any form of TDV within the previous 12 months, whereby rates varied considerably by the dimension of TDV. Controlling for a range of risk factors on the classroom level (proportion of students dependent on social welfare, proportion of students with migration background) and individual level (exposure to family violence, sociodemographic characteristics, TDV victimization, and peer- and school-related factors), regression analyses showed that higher rates of classroom-level TDV perpetration were positively related to individual verbal/emotional TDV perpetration. This pattern of results was observable across all dimensions of TDV. Furthermore, gender-specific patterns of TDV perpetration were observable: Girls were more affected by classroom levels of verbal/emotional and physical TDV than boys, while boys were more affected by classroom levels of relational and sexual TDV.

This study was designed to evaluate age–sex-specific IPV mortality trends and the assault mechanisms (firearm, sharp objects, and other means), at national and provincial levels, in Iran. We used the Iranian Death Registration System (DRS) and the population and housing censuses in this analysis. Spatio-temporal and Gaussian Process Regression methods were used to adjust for inconsistencies at the provincial level and to integrate data from various sources. After assessing their validity, all records were reclassified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). All ICD-10 codes were then mapped to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 coding. More than 700 individuals died due to IPV in 1990 and more than twice this number in 2015. The IPV mortality age-standardized rate, per 100,000, increased from 1.62 (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI] = [0.96, 2.75]) in 1990 to 1.81 [1.15, 2.89] in 2015.

369,"© The Author(s) 2019.An entrenched assumption in the mental health field is that if left “untreated” the aftermath of sexual assault will inevitably lead to some diagnosable form of emotional distress. This assumption has focused the search for pathology on individual survivors rather than systems and led to societal pressure for medical or psychotherapeutic treatment following unwanted sexual experiences in the United States and globally. Humanistic psychology is grounded in an existential phenomenological approach that privileges agency and a sociopolitical context of lived experience. As such, it has great overlap with the social justice mission of liberation psychology and is well equipped to respond to sexual assault survivors and the oppressive and patriarchal systems that perpetuate gender-based violence. This article explores the rising use of neoliberal medicalized frameworks to respond to sexual assault in therapy, analyzing both positive and negative aspects of medicalization.

370,"© 2021 IEEE.In this paper, we applied data mining to determine the causes of gender-based violence against women in Ecuador. We divided the original database into 30 subsets, according to the scopes in which violence occurs. We previously classified these subsets using six algorithms, namely Decision Trees(J48), Exhaustive CHAID, Neural Networks, Nearest Neighbors (IBk), Decision Tables, and Random Forests. The results of this classification showed a bias towards the majority class; for this reason, we applied the SMOTE Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to balance the classes and obtain better results. For the predictions of the causes of violence, we used Exhaustive CHAID because our variables are mostly non-binary, and this algorithm allowed us to generate trees with more than two branches. IBk algorithm was the best at globally classifying the data, and Random Forests performed the best in classification precision. The predictions obtained from the 30 subsets of data show that the most common causes for a woman to suffer violence are: when her partner drinks or consumes alcohol or drugs; if her partner is in another relationship; when her husbands suffered violence in childhood; and when the woman was touched without her consent or denigrated for being a woman.",2021-10-12,Conference Proceeding,Conference Paper,ETCM 2021 - 5th Ecuador Technical Chapters Meeting,21101066123,0,,Data Mining to Determine the Causes of Gender-Based Violence against Women in Ecuador,0,false,10.1109/ETCM53643.2021.9590664,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2021 IEEE Fifth Ecuador Technical Chapters Meeting (ETCM),2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The predictions obtained from the 30 subsets of data show that the most common causes for a woman to suffer violence are: when her partner drinks or consumes alcohol or drugs; if her partner is in another relationship; and when the woman was touched without her consent or denigrated for being a woman.'}",370,1412960674,Oscar M.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, public education has been forced to hold classes online, which increases the time students are on the internet at home. While this situation has significantly reduced the incidence of physical violence between students, cyberbullying has increased sharply, even among younger students. This paper examines a program developed to educate elementary school students on how to best respond to cyberbullying—a social issue that hinders the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The program was applied to students, and the educational effects were tracked. First, we analyzed education programs in South Korea and the United States that teach students how to cope with cyberbullying, extracted characteristic parts, and developed the online education program in accordance with the current situation in South Korea. Next, we conducted an online education preference survey through an independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA. As a result, regardless of gender and grade, most study subjects preferred online education. In addition, we conducted a paired sample t-test to determine the prevention and response effects of suggested online education programs. According to the test, the study subjects experienced less cyberbullying and victimization after participating in the online education program. Additional benefits were the students’ increased ability to defend against cyberbullying and a decreased need for defenders and assistants in warding off the cyberbullies.",2021-10-01,Journal,Article,Sustainability (Switzerland),21100240100,2,13,Can online education programs solve the cyberbullying problem?

Understanding factors associated with the development of aggression offers possibilities for prevention and targeted interventions. This review discusses factors that contribute to the development of aggression on psychiatric wards. Method In Pubmed and Embase, a search was performed aimed at: prevalence data, ward characteristics, patient and staff factors that are associated with aggressive behaviour and from this search 146 studies were included. Results The prevalence of aggressive behaviour on psychiatric wards varied (8–76%). Explanatory factors of aggressive behaviour were subdivided into patient, staff and ward factors. Patient risk factors were diagnosis of psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, substance abuse, a history of aggression, younger age. Staff risk factors included male gender, unqualified or temporary staff, job strain, dissatisfaction with the job or management, burn-out and quality of the interaction between patients and staff. Staff protective factors were a good functioning team, good leadership and being involved in treatment decisions. Significant ward risk factors were a higher bed occupancy, busy places on the ward, walking rounds, an unsafe environment, a restrictive environment, lack of structure in the day, smoking and lack of privacy. Conclusion Despite a lack of prospective quantitative data, results did show that aggression arises from a combination of patient factors, staff factors and ward factors. Patient factors were studied most often, however, besides treatment, offering the least possibilities in prevention of aggression development. Future studies should focus more on the earlier stages of aggression such as agitation and on factors that are better suited for preventing aggression such as ward and staff factors. Management and clinicians could adapt staffing and ward in line with these results.",2021-10-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,18,16,Aggression on the psychiatric ward: Prevalence and risk factors.

373,"© 2021 The Author(s)Introduction: Romantic experiences during adolescence have an important influence on functioning later in life. Romantic love has been associated with the acceptance of abusive behaviors. This study examined the relationship between myths of romantic love and the perceived severity of different types of abusive behaviors, as well as the influence of gender. Methods: The sample comprised 448 Spanish adolescents (M = 12.92 years old; SD = 0.85), of which 50.3% were male and 49.7% were female. Participants were evaluated in the school setting. The Perception of Abuse Scale and the Myths, Fallacies, and Misconceptions about Romantic Love Scale were administered. Results: Statistically significant negative associations between the myths of romantic love and the perceived severity of abusive behaviors were found. Myths regarding possession, dedication, and exclusivity were associated with a lower perceived severity of abusive behaviors in adolescent males. Myths regarding the omnipotence of love were associated with a lower perceived severity of abusive behaviors in adolescent females. Believing in jealousy as a demonstration of love (myth of jealousy) and in the need to establish a steady union when you love someone (marriage myth) explained a lower perceived severity of abusive behaviors in regression models. However, being female and having these beliefs explained a higher perceived severity of abusive behaviors. Conclusions: The myths of romantic love are already present during early adolescence. These beliefs are implicated in the construction of gender inequality and difficulties in the identification of dating abuse behavior severity. A gendered perspective is necessary to understand this issue. Early intervention strategies should address the cognitive and emotional components of intimate relationships.",2021-10-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Adolescence,25655,1,92,Influence of beliefs about romantic love on the justification of abusive behaviors among early adolescents,1,true,10.1016/j.adolescence.2021.09.001,Academic Press,Journal des adolescens,2021.0,36.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study examined the relationship between myths of romantic love and the perceived severity of different types of abusive behaviors, as well as the influence of gender.'}",373,2083176868,E.

Although sexual assault is influenced by a myriad of societal and interpersonal factors, misunderstandings during the communication and interpretation of sexual consent signals likely contribute to this public health crisis. Unfortunately, research on sexual consent miscommunication has been heavily informed by heteronormative theories and conducted primarily with cisgender heterosexual men and women. The present study attempted to help address this gap in the literature by exploring factors that contribute to sexual consent attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in a sample of 251 cisgender and nonbinary sexual minority young adults. Nonbinary participants reported more proactive sexual consent attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors than cisgender participants. Sexual assertiveness was also a robust and unique predictor of adaptive sexual consent, particularly among those who identified as more traditionally masculine. Findings from the current study may help guide the development of more inclusive, research-informed sexual consent and sexual violence prevention programs.",2021-10-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,1,85,"Predictors of Sexual Consent Attitudes, Beliefs, and Behaviors Among Sexual Minority Cisgender and Nonbinary Young Adults",0,false,10.1007/s11199-021-01226-5,Springer,Sex Roles,2021.0,73.0,0.0,,374,144898771,J.

Though the goals of the movement included de-stigmatization and support for victims, the discourse that followed often resulted in highly varied responses to reported incidents. In this study, we examined American adult (n = 512) perceptions about #MeToo and whether gender and ideological beliefs, including sexism, religiosity, and political affiliation, as well as pre-allegation likability of the alleged perpetrator, influenced respondents’ assessments of the incidents. We focused our examination on two very different, high-profile examples of sexual misconduct allegations, specifically against film producer Harvey Weinstein and comedian Aziz Ansari. We found that personal characteristics of respondents related to individuals’ negative assessments of alleged sexual assault perpetrators. Regression analyses showed that higher age and stronger beliefs that sexism exists in our culture predicted harsher judgments of Weinstein, but stronger beliefs that sexism exists in our culture, male gender, lower levels of pre-allegation favorability for Ansari, and higher levels of social religiosity predicted harsher judgments of Ansari.

376,"© The Author(s) 2019.Inequitable gender norms, including the acceptance of violence in intimate relationships, have been found to be associated with the occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration and victimization. Despite these findings, few studies have considered whether inequitable gender norms are related to IPV severity. This study uses baseline data from a psychotherapeutic intervention targeting heterosexual couples (n = 247) in Lusaka, Zambia, who reported moderate to severe male-perpetrated IPV and male hazardous alcohol use to consider: (a) prevailing gender norms, including those related to IPV; (b) the relationship between IPV acceptance and IPV severity; and (c) the relationship between inequitable gender norms and IPV severity. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to model the relationships between IPV acceptance and inequitable gender norms, and female-reported IPV severity (including threats of violence, physical violence, sexual violence, and total violence), separately among male and female participants. In general, men and women were similar in their patterns of agreement with gender norms, with both highly endorsing items related to household roles. More than three-quarters of men (78.1%) and women (78.5%) indicated overall acceptance of violence in intimate relationships, with no significant differences between men and women in their endorsement of any IPV-related gender norms. Among men, IPV acceptance was associated with a statistically significant increase in IPV perpetration severity in terms of threatening violence (B = 5.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.84, 9.89]), physical violence (B = 4.54, 95% CI = [0.10, 8.98]), and total violence (B = 11.65, 95% CI = [3.14, 20.16]). There was no association between IPV acceptance and IPV victimization severity among women.

Smart devices are here to stay, and in adolescence they have become the means of socialization par excellence, the fundamental instrument for communicating and relating to the world. While it is true that these types of devices offer innumerable advantages, improper use involves risks and dangers. One of these dangers is the furtherance of gender inequality, reinforcing existing social and cultural structures and provoking new types of patriarchal violence. The aim of this study was to identify behaviors of gender-based violence practiced by male and female adolescents in virtual environments, and to confirm whether there are significant differences based on the variables of gender or school grade. Method. A cross-sectional, descriptive, ex post facto study was carried out in, involving 615 participating adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The instrument used in this research was an ad hoc questionnaire developed for this study. Results. The results showed that behaviors of gender-based violence in virtual environments were carried out to a greater extent by the male adolescents, except in the case of behaviors related to myths of romantic love. This type of gender-based violence has been recognized by experts in the field and is carried out mainly by women. It was also observed that genderbased violence was practiced more by the 10th-graders. Discussion and conclusions. The results of this study reveal the need for educational interventions to prevent gender-based violence in virtual environments, as well as measures designed to treat the especially detrimental effects of this type of behavior in adolescence.",2021-09-01,Journal,Article,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,18800156721,0,19,Gender-based violence in virtual environments: a look at adolescent reality,1,true,10.25115/EJREP.V19I55.4320,Universidad de Almeria,Electronic Journal of Research in Education Psychology,2021.0,0.0,0.0,,378,2142915966,Milena Villar Varela,1422353453,M.

In examining these power dynamics in the context of health inequalities, scholars have deployed Feminist political ecology analytical framework to situate gender and other forms of vulnerability as emerging from unequal power relations, and political ecology of health to emphasise the health implications of inherent relational power in the distribution of resources. Although appealing, the two theoretical frameworks over time have proven to be limiting in the study of intersectional vulnerabilities such as gender-based violence and water insecurity which reflect multiple dimensions of unequal power structures. This study expands the theoretical space for the study of inequalities in health geography by demonstrating the utility of incorporating feminist political ecology with political ecology of health to form an integrated theoretical framework – Feminist Political Ecology of Health (FPEH). This proposed theoretical framework gives guidance for engaging with a suite of questions and methods related to multifaceted problems such as water insecurity and gender based-violence.

383,"© 2021 The AuthorsBackground: Machine learning techniques can explore low prevalence data to offer insight into identification of factors associated with non-marital sexual violence (NMSV). NMSV in India is a health and human rights concern that disproportionately affects adolescents, is under-reported, and not well understood or addressed in the country. Methods: We applied machine learning methods to retrospective cross-sectional data from India's nationally-representative National Family Health Survey 4, a demographic and health study conducted in 2015–16, which offers 4000+ variables as potential independent variables. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) or L-1 regularized logistic regression models as well as L-2 regularized logistic regression or ridge models; we conducted an iterative thematic analysis (ITA) of variables generated from a series of regularized models. Findings: Thematic analysis of regularized models highlight that past exposure to violence was most predictive of NMSV, followed by geography, sexual behavior, and poor sexual and reproductive health knowledge. After these, indicators largely related to resources and autonomy (e.g., access to health services, and income generating) were associated with NMSV. Exploratory analysis with the subsample of never married adolescents 15–19 years old, a population with higher representation of recent NMSV, further emphasized the role of wealth and mobility as key correlates of NMSV, along with poor HIV knowledge, tobacco use, higher fertility preferences, and attitudes accepting of marital violence. Interpretation: Findings indicate the validity of machine learning with iterative theme analysis (ITA) to identify factors associated with violence. Findings were consistent with prior work demonstrating associations between NMSV and other violence experiences, but also showed novel correlates such as lower SRH knowledge and service utilization and, for girls, norms and preferences suggesting more restrictive gender norms.

In South Africa, an increased risk for gender-based domestic violence against women during the lockdown period was reported by various sources including the national gender-based violence call centre (GBVCC), the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the civil society. Covid-19 lockdown encouraged spatial distance: a public health measure. This measure inadvertently created social distance and social disconnection. Public life, which is frequently a coping mechanism and an escape for some women and girls at risk of domestic violence, was curtailed by the lockdown rules that forbade movements. Informal sources of help for victims of abuse were limited due to closed economic activities, and community-based helping services for domestic violence were not permitted to open. Some victims of domestic violence struggled with public transportation to access informal help, visit the police, social workers and other sources of help. Some organisations offered online and telephone services. The increased risk of gender-based domestic violence during the lockdown is indicative of poly-violence that women are exposed to.

385,"© 2021Background: Little is known about access to treatment or maladaptive coping amongst those with a history of childhood trauma and subsequent depressive disorder, which is often complicated by post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Aims: To (1) identify profiles of complex childhood trauma amongst men and women with major depression, (2) examine patterns of service access and treatment or maladaptive coping (drug misuse, alcohol abuse or suicidality), and (3) associations with socio-economic/demographic characteristics, comorbid PTSD, anxiety/mood disorders and perceived social support. Method: Analysis of Wave 3 of the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions (NESARC) (2012‐2013). We use the Latent Class Analysis 3-step approach in Mplus to examine individual differences in childhood experiences and coping behaviour. We examined both (a) the inter-relationship of this patterning, and (b) the extent to which proactive and maladaptive coping are associated with socio-economic/demographic characteristics, comorbid PTSD, anxiety disorders and perceived social support. Results: a diagnosis of Major Depression was recorded for 7432 people, two thirds of whom reported a history of complex childhood trauma. Maladaptive coping is associated with the most severe trauma groups, comorbid PTSD, dysthymia, and anxiety disorders.

386,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Aims: We examine the extent to which adolescent and young adult psychosocial factors are associated with variation in the experience of common types of harm (e.g., injuries, violence, sexual regrets) with respect to binge-drinking frequency – termed residual harm. Methods: Data were from the Australian Temperament Project, a population-based cohort study that has followed a sample of young Australians from infancy to adulthood since 1983. The current sample comprised 1,081 (565 women). Residual harm was operationalised by saving residuals from models regressing number of alcohol harms onto binge-drinking frequency at each of 5 waves, two in adolescence (15–16 and 17–18 years) and three in young adulthood (19–20, 23–24, and 27–28 years). Psychosocial factors (mental health, social skills, quality of parent and peer relationships) were assessed prior to binge drinking in early adolescence (13–14 years) and then again in young adulthood (19–20 years). Results: Adolescent predictors of decreased residual harm were lower depressive symptoms, and higher cooperation, self-control, and peer and parent attachment. Young adult predictors of decreased residual harm were lower depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms and peer and parent negative appraisal, and higher responsibility, and peer and parent emotional support. Associations were evident in males and females, although the strength of some associations diminished with age.

387,"© 2021The authors examine the prevalence and characteristics of sexual violence victimization - rape and being made to penetrate [MTP] (men only) - involving substances (alcohol or other drugs). Although it has been well-documented that perpetrators commit sexual violence against individuals who are using alcohol or drugs, more research is needed to describe the problem at a national level. Data are from the 2010–2012 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, a nationally representative random-digit-dial telephone survey of English- and Spanish-speaking adults in the United States (n = 41,174). Findings reveal that among victims of physically forced rape, 26.2 % of female and 30.0 % of male victims reported substance use; 44.5 % of male MTP victims reported substance use. The majority of forced rape and MTP victims reported the perpetrator was using alcohol or drugs. Among victims of alcohol/drug-facilitated rape, 29.7 % of female and 32.4 % of male victims reported involuntary use of substances, mostly drugs; 84.0 % of female and 82.6 % of male victims reported voluntary use. Among male victims of alcohol/drug-facilitated MTP, 14.6 % reported involuntary and 85.4 % reported voluntary use of substances. Female and male victims reported that the majority of intimate partner, acquaintance, and stranger perpetrators were using substances during the victimization.

388,"© 2021Background: Although studies have investigated the association between alcohol use and violent behaviors such as weapon carrying, few studies have examined the association between age at first alcohol use and weapon-carrying among adolescents. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between age at first alcohol use and weapon carrying among adolescents. Methods: Data for this study came from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. An analytic sample of 13,442 adolescents aged 14–18 years old (51% female) was analyzed using binary logistic regression. The outcome variable investigated in this study was weapon carrying during the past 30 days, and the main explanatory variable investigated was age at first alcohol use. Results: Of the 13,442 adolescents, 13.5% carried a weapon during the past 30 days, and 15.4% reported having their first alcoholic drink before age 13. In the multivariable logistic regression, adolescents who reported having alcohol before age 13 had more than double the odds of carrying a weapon when compared to those who never had alcohol before age 13 (AOR = 2.32, p < .001, 95% CI = 1.87-2.89). Other significant factors associated with weapon carrying include male gender, victim of bullying, teen dating violence, sexual violence, suicidal ideation, and history of substance use. Adolescents who self-identified as Black/African American or Hispanic were significantly less likely to carry a weapon when compared to adolescents who self-identified as non-Hispanic White.

391,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdGlobally, the range, scale and burden of all forms of violence against children (VAC) have visibly increased. Yet VAC as a physical, mental, public and social health concern is only recently gaining the prominence it deserves. Addressing VAC is critical. Violence experienced early in life can result in short, medium, long-lasting, and/or even inter-generational negative health outcomes. Ample evidence shows that VAC is widespread and the most common forms are usually perpetrated by people with whom children interact every day in their homes, schools and communities. We report on an innovative collaboration between global agencies, led by the International Society for Social Pediatrics and Child Health (ISSOP), the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN), and the International Pediatric Association (IPA), who were galvanized to respond to VAC using a child-rights and public health lens. This collaboration led to a position statement on VAC with an implementation plan. The strength of the position statement was the explicit incorporation of a rights-based expansive understanding of VAC, with a description of typologies of violence pertinent to children globally, including child labor, children in armed conflict, trafficking of children and gender-based violence; and the identification of strategies both in preventing violence from occurring and ameliorating the effects in its aftermath.

In Malawi, 42% of ever-married women have experienced some form of violence perpetrated by their current or most recent spouse. A number of studies have investigated intimate partner violence in Malawi within the context of HIV/AIDS, girls’ sexual abuse, and psychological distress, and a few studies report on the role of sociocultural factors in influencing gender-based violence. No study has used cluster analysis to systematically analyze different levels of abuse among married women in Malawi. Using the 2015 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey data, we employed cluster analysis and multinomial logistic regression to analyze the distribution of different levels of abuse among married women in Malawi and the key attributes associated with each level of abuse. Correlates of domestic violence significantly differ by levels of abuse and are distributed as follows: controlling behavior (11.8%), general controlling behavior (GCB; 27.1%), moderate physical and emotional abuse (27.2%), and the high and complete abuse (8.5%). Alcohol consumption, ethnicity, and women working status were significantly associated with all four levels of abuse, but age and religion were only associated with controlling behavior and generalized controlling behavior. The strength of association between husband’s alcohol consumption, woman’s working status, and marriage type and domestic violence increased by level of abuse. On each of these factors, the odds of experiencing violence were lowest in the controlling behavior group and highest in the high physical and emotional abuse group.

395,"© Authors 2021Introduction Women living with HIV (WLWH) experience accelerated ageing and an increased risk of age-associated diseases earlier in life, compared with women without HIV. This is likely due to a combination of viral factors, gender differences, hormonal imbalance and psychosocial and structural conditions. This interdisciplinary cohort study aims to understand how biological, clinical and sociostructural determinants of health interact to modulate healthy ageing in WLWH. Methods and analysis The British Columbia Children and Women: AntiRetroviral therapy and Markers of Aging-Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CARMA-CHIWOS) Collaboration (BCC3) study will enrol WLWH (n=350) and sociodemographically matched HIV-negative women (n=350) living in British Columbia. A subset of BCC3 participants will be past participants of CARMA, n≥1000 women and children living with and without HIV, 2008-2018 and/or CHIWOS, n=1422 WLWH, 2013-2018. Over two study visits, we will collect biological specimens for virus serologies, hormones and biological markers as well as administer a survey capturing demographic and sociostructural-behavioural factors. Sociodemographics, comorbidities, number and type of chronic/latent viral infections and hormonal irregularities will be compared between the two groups. Their association with biological markers and psychostructural and sociostructural factors will be investigated through multivariable regression and structural equation modelling. Retrospective longitudinal analyses will be conducted on data from past CARMA/CHIWOS participants. As BCC3 aims to follow participants as they age, this protocol will focus on the first study visits. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the University of British Columbia Children's and Women's Research Ethics Board (H19-00896). Results will be shared in peer-reviewed journals, conferences and at community events as well as at www.hivhearme.ca and @HIV-HEAR-me.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Currently, the most successful prevention interventions against sexual violence (SV) on United States college campuses target modifications at the individual and interpersonal levels. Community-level interventions have been under-developed for college campuses. To address this gap, we employ a citizen science model for understanding campus community factors affecting SV risk.

398,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdIntroduction: Interpersonal support can promote positive outcomes among people living with HIV. In order to develop an acceptable psychoeducational couples-based intervention aimed at strengthening the relationship context and improving HIV outcomes before and after pregnancy, we conducted qualitative interviews with pregnant women living with HIV and their male partners. Methods: We interviewed a convenience clinic-based sample of pregnant women living with HIV (n = 30) and male partners (n = 18) in Lusaka, Zambia. Interviews included pile sorting relationship topics in order of perceived priority. Interviews also focused on family health concerns. Interviews were audio-recorded, translated, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Pile sorting data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: All female participants were living with HIV; 61% of the male partners interviewed were additionally living with HIV. The most prioritized relationship topic among both genders was communication between couples. Honesty and respect were important relationship topics but prioritized differently based on gender. Female participants considered emotional and instrumental support from male partners critical for their physical and mental health; men did not prioritize support. Intimate partner violence was discussed often by both genders. Family health priorities included good nutrition during pregnancy, preventing infant HIV infection, safe infant feeding, sexual health, and men's alcohol use. Conclusions: A major contribution of this study is a better understanding of the dyad-level factors pregnant women living with HIV and their male partners perceive to be the most important for a healthy, well-functioning relationship. This study additionally identified gaps in antenatal health education and the specific family health issues most prioritized by pregnant women living with HIV and their male partners. The findings of this study will inform the development of an acceptable couples-based intervention with greater likelihood of efficacy in strengthening the relationship context and promoting family health during and after pregnancies that are affected by HIV.",2021-08-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,2,283,Designing a couple-based relationship strengthening and health enhancing intervention for pregnant women living with HIV and their male partners in Zambia: Interview findings from the target community,0,false,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114029,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2021.0,57.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A major contribution of this study is a better understanding of the dyad-level factors pregnant women living with HIV and their male partners perceive to be the most important for a healthy, well-functioning relationship.'}",398,9718311,K.

399,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdObjective: This study was conducted to identify the profiles of children who experience perpetration and victimization in school violence and to test whether individual- and relational factors may differentiate the identified profiles. Method: This study targeted 4328 children in the 6 th -grade (47.8% female) extracted from the Seoul Education Longitudinal Study (SELS). Items used to measure school violence includes verbal violence, social exclusion, physical violence, spreading malicious rumors, extortion, coercion/threat. Those experiences were captured on the basis of frequency. Individual factors cover self-esteem and self-control, and relationship factors contain parent-child relationship and teacher-student relationship. Gender was introduced as a control variable. Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was utilized to classify profiles, and a modified three-step procedure was used to verify individual and relational factors in created profiles of school violence. Result: A three-profile solution was obtained: Exchanging rare verbal violence (90.20%), interpersonal victimization (7.50%), and inflicting violence (2.30%). First, higher levels of self-esteem made children less likely to belong to the interpersonal victimization group than exchanging rare verbal violence group. Second, greater selfcontrol made children less likely to belong to the inflicting violence group than the exchanging rare verbal violence group. Higher levels of self-control also increased the likelihood of children being placed in interpersonal victimization group rather than inflicting violence group. Third, cohesive and close parent-child relationship made children have a lower likelihood to be affiliated with the interpersonal victimization group than exchanging rare verbal violence group. Lastly, a cohesive and close teacher-student relationship made children less likely to belong to the inflicting violence group or interpersonal victimization group than exchanging rare verbal violence group. Conclusion: The findings can guide how school-based violence prevention can be designed, including enhancing individual competencies (i.e., self-esteem and selfcontrol), by establishing regular training programs in school settings. In addition, findings that relationships with parents and teachers affect children's experiences of school violence suggest focusing not only on affected children but also on taking an approach that encompasses the organically connected relationships surrounding children. This could be achieved by developing and distributing relevant materials or various training programs for the purpose of building their cohesive and supportive relationship with children.

This is due to its smaller scale and lower profile compared to ‘men-to-women’ violence, and its perceived lower impact on society. In 2017, in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 never-married single Chinese women aged 30–48 in 13 cities across mainland China, to ascertain how single women in China both perceive and experience ‘women-to-women’ violence. The field research provided extensive evidence that urban unmarried women over the age of 30 are still negatively perceived in contemporary Chinese society, and are subject to a range of punitive actions including insults, verbal violence and social exclusion. Notably, most of the direct perpetrators of violent acts against single women are married women, who are seen to accept and defend the patriarchal society and value system to vilify the existence of single women. Manifestations of the negative image of single women range from moral condemnation and voicing support for patriarchal gender roles, to verbal and physical attacks on single women. This study contributes to the growing recognition of gender-based ‘women-to-women’ violence and the public hostility single women face in China, with the hope that greater awareness of the problem can help single women to live in a more tolerant social environment.",2021-08-01,Journal,Article,Sexuality and Culture,145138,1,25,Gender-Based ‘Women-to-Women’ Violence Against Urban Chinese Single Women (Aged 30–48) in Contemporary China,0,false,10.1007/s12119-021-09839-4,Springer,Sexuality & Culture,2021.0,109.0,0.0,,400,2118812504,Shaofeng Tang,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,14.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology
401,"© The Author(s) 2020.Increasing recognition of the long-term negative impacts of gendered violence has led to the establishment of a variety of social support services. Feminist research has examined the barriers that prevent women from accessing these services and the problems women report getting the help they need. However, little is known about what happens in situ when women interact with support services. This paper is a novel empirical investigation of naturalistic social interactions where women seek help with problems resulting from violence at home. We used conversation analysis to examine how problems of housing instability and help-seeking unfolded in recorded telephone calls to a victim support service. We found that the routine institutional practice of asking for an address posed interactional trouble for women who were seeking to leave violence, had left a violent home, or were homeless as a result of violence. When answers could not be provided, callers’ responses included disclosures of violence or challenges to the meanings of address. Our findings point to an interactional burden that women confront in institutional interactions. We suggest institutions should carefully consider how routine practices such as asking for an address might pose unintended problems for service users in vulnerable circumstances.",2021-08-01,Journal,Article,Feminism and Psychology,14172,0,31,“I don’t have an address”: Housing instability and domestic violence in help-seeking calls to a support service,2,,10.1177/0959353520963977,SAGE Publications Ltd,Feminism and Psychology,2020.0,52.0,0.0,,401,10541594,A.

402,"© The Author(s) 2020.Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects millions of individuals across all demographics and ethnicities. Research has revealed a direct link between experiencing IPV and having adverse physical, mental, and financial outcomes which can create difficulties for survivors. Survivors experiencing these adverse outcomes are likely to seek out support to address these issues, increasing the likelihood that they will encounter mental health professionals (MHPs). MHPs can play a significant role in assessing and addressing IPV since they are often critical access points for those experiencing violence and are likely to counsel victims. Accurate identification of current or past IPV victimization is crucial to avoiding the potential of misdiagnosis of survivors. In addition, by applying and emphasizing an understanding of the connection between individual and structural explorations of gender, race, class, and other socially constructed identities, mental health professionals can utilize the skills necessary to challenge inequalities, which in turn can encourage survivors to create strategies that make sense to themselves and their communities. This study explores what is known about how MHPs are prepared to work with IPV. Peer-reviewed journals that were published between 2005 and 2019 were reviewed systematically to develop a better understanding of the existing literature. We sought to answer the question, “What is known about how MHPs are prepared to work with IPV?” This review identified 20 articles regarding training experiences of MHPs and how these experiences shaped their responses to and practice with those experiencing IPV.",2021-08-01,Journal,Article,Affilia - Journal of Women and Social Work,28149,3,36,Preparing Mental Health Professionals to Work With Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence: A Comprehensive Systematic Review of the Literature,0,false,10.1177/0886109920960827,SAGE Publications Inc.,,2020.0,61.0,1.0,,402,20531849,A.

To conduct exploratory and comparative analysis, this study recruited 922 students in four Asian countries (India, Iran, Malaysia, and Pakistan), as well as Asian British and White British students in England. All participants read a brief vignette depicting a man whose relatives verbally abuse him and threaten him with life-threatening violence, after suspecting that he is gay and has joined an online dating website to meet men. Participants then completed a short questionnaire that assessed the extent to which they thought the man’s actions had damaged his family’s honor and their approval of the antigay “honor” abuse depicted in the scenario. Broadly in line with predictions, data analyses revealed attitudes more supportive of antigay “honor” abuse in all five collectivist-orientated populations than the sample of individualistic-orientated counterparts in England. Notably, however, a series of one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) demonstrated that these results varied depending on country of residence, gender, religious denomination, educational status, and age. The findings show that individual and demographic differences influence perceptions toward homophobic “honor” abuse in collectivist cultures.

Gender-specific differences in parenting and violent behavior have been studied for many years. Yet, relatively little is known about the impact of gender interactions on parent-to-child physical violence or the impact of such violence on children’s perceptions of their parents’ behavior. This study used data collected from 618 students in academic institutions in northern Israel to examine the relationship between different gender interactions (e.g., mother–daughter, mother–son, father–daughter, and father–son) and the frequency of corporal punishment experienced by the respondents when they were in elementary school (between the ages 6 and 12). This study also examined whether gender interactions influence the relationship between corporal punishment and respondents’ perceptions of their parents’ behavior, namely the perceived parenting the respondents received during childhood. Cross tabulations and repeated measures were used to analyze the data. Significantly fewer daughters (as compared with sons) experienced corporal punishment and significantly fewer daughters experienced corporal punishment from both parents. Corporal punishment had a significant negative impact on the perceived parent–child relationship.

To address this gap in the literature, we utilize data from 702 college women and 677 college men to explore childhood sexual abuse, family violence, sexual minority (SM) status, and problematic alcohol use as potential moderators of the association between hooking-up and three forms of sexual victimization: coerced, incapacitated, and forced.

To understand better the meaning of these new profiles as well as their temporal consistency, the profiles were related to different outcomes of the current psychological treatments, before and after a prescribed one, such as self-deception, moral self-concept, benevolent sexism, and hostile sexism. Results from Latent Profile Analysis and Latent Transition Analysis showed good fit for a four-profile solution.

The study aimed to assess the knowledge about various domains of IPV and self-reported prediction of perpetrating IPV among adolescents in Madurai city, South India. Students pursuing engineering, medicine and humanities were recruited conveniently. A structured self-administered questionnaire developed to cater to the objectives was used. After descriptive analysis, a modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimation was used to identify factors associated with one's self-reported prediction of becoming an IPV perpetrator and adjusted relative risks [0.95 confidence interval (CI)] were calculated. The project was approved by the Institute's Ethics Committee. Of the 369 students, 40% were aware of IPV prevalence among women in India. About 85% agreed with societally prescribed gender roles. More males than females found gender roles manifesting as IPV acceptable (p = 0.003). Only 6.8%, more females than males (p = 0.01), believed that no violence is permissible in intimate relationships. About 55% definitely did not foresee themselves becoming IPV perpetrators.

To test the associations between women's reports of partner alcohol use and their experience of IPV, in three countries in Africa. Design Pooled analysis of cross-sectional baseline data from men and women participating in four IPV prevention studies across Africa and Asia. Setting Data from five data sets generated by four violence against women and girls prevention studies in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa, Ghana and Rwanda. Participants 8104 men 18+ years old and 5613 women 18+ years old from a mix of volunteer and randomly selected samples. Main outcome measures Studies employed comparable measures of past year alcohol use, harmful alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scale) and items from modified WHO Women's Health and Domestic Violence to measure physical IPV and NPSV perpetration among men and IPV experience among women. Findings Overall harmful alcohol use among men was associated with a substantially increased odds of perpetrating physical IPV (adjusted OR (aOR)=3.45 (95% CI 2.56 to 4.64)) and NPSV (aOR=2.64 (95% CI 1.85 to 3.76)) compared with non-drinkers.

PTEs during the asylum-seeking journey were reported at 12.0% (95% CI 10.7–13.4), however, when examined by region of origin, the proportion was 34.5% (95% CI 29.5–39.8) for asylum seekers from Africa (excluding North Africa). Significant symptoms of depression were reported by 41.7% (95% CI 39.6–43.9) of asylum seekers and symptoms of anxiety by 34.2% (95% CI 32.1–36.2). Half of the asylum seekers were assessed as having at least a medium-risk for psychological trauma. Prevalence rates were higher among females and asylum seekers from Africa.

411,"© 2021 The Royal Society for Public HealthObjectives: Sexual violence is a serious global health problem with short- and long-term physical, mental, and reproductive adverse effects. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with sexual violence among women of reproductive age in rural Uganda. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study based on the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) 2016 data. Methods: UDHS 2016 data for 5259 rural women aged 15–49 years were used in this study. Multistage stratified sampling was used to select participants, and data were collected using validated questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with sexual violence. All analyses we carried out in SPSS (version 25). Results: The overall prevalence of sexual violence among rural women was 24.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.4–25.7) compared with 18.4% (95% CI: 17.0–20.7) among urban women. Rural women who had received only primary education had higher odds of sexual violence compared with those who had received tertiary education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.17–7.72). Women living in the Western region were more likely to experience sexual violence than those living in the Northern region of Uganda (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.41–2.87). In addition, women in the poorest wealth quintile had higher odds of sexual violence compared with those in the richest quintile (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.02–4.17). Women justifying beating, health care decision-making, and husband's/partner's frequency of getting drunk were also significantly associated with sexual violence. Conclusions: The prevalence of sexual violence among rural Ugandan women was high and is associated with factors such as educational level, region, wealth index, justified beating, health care decision-making, and husband's/partner's frequency of getting drunk. Thus, there is a need to improve the livelihoods and income of rural women, including the promotion of continued education for girls, as well as to strengthen protective laws and policies to curb this public health issue.",2021-07-01,Journal,Article,Public Health,17697,5,196,Prevalence and factors associated with sexual violence among women aged 15–49 years in rural Uganda: evidence from the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey 2016,2,,10.1016/j.puhe.2021.05.004,Elsevier B.V.,Public Health,2021.0,28.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""The prevalence of sexual violence among rural Ugandan women was high and is associated with factors such as educational level, region, wealth index, justified beating, health care decision-making, and husband's/partner's frequency of getting drunk.""}",411,101397356,J.

412,"© 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.Modern slavery is a significant global human rights crisis that disproportionately affects women and girls, and research indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities to exploitation. Early evidence suggests that the pandemic has disproportionately affected women and girls, including an increase in lack of access to family planning and adequate sexual and reproductive care and an increase in maternal mortality rates. Additionally, the pandemic has instigated a reduction in economic opportunities and access to education for women and girls and increased violence against women. For this study, regression analysis was used to examine country-level data from 197 UNmember countries. Predictor variables included indicators reflecting key areas addressed by UN Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG-5): gender inequality, educational and economic opportunities for females, women's leadership, gendered violence, and women's health. SDG-5 calls for gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. The criterion variable was the estimated prevalence of modern slavery across UN countries. Regression analysis revealed significant results across all models. Literacy rates and expected years of schooling for females, femicide, lifetime prevalence of violence, and several indicators of women's health were found to be strongly and significantly related to increased estimated prevalence ofmodern slavery. Furthermore, we propose that the pandemic has increased vulnerability to exploitation for women and girls by regressing progress across all areas addressed by SDG-5.",2021-07-01,Journal,Review,"International Perspectives in Psychology: Research, Practice, Consultation",21100824968,2,10,COVID-19 and Women: Key Components of SDG-5 and the Estimated Prevalence of Modern Slavery,0,false,10.1027/2157-3891/a000019,Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co.

413,"© 2021 The AuthorsObjective: We conducted a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on subjective experiences of gender dysphoria (GD) amongst transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth in order to improve clinical encounters, complement existing knowledge and potentially influence future research. Methods: We systematically searched for qualitative studies on GD in English, German, Spanish and Scandinavian languages in seven databases. Starting with 2000 articles, we finally included 12 papers in the meta-synthesis, following Noblit and Hare's (1988) seven steps for qualitative meta-synthesis research. Results: Through the consistent comparison of key concepts, we were able to cluster the findings from the 12 included studies into four meta-themes: (1) the emerging understanding and awareness of GD was described as navigation in the dark, (2) the importance of relationships and societal norms, (3) the role of the body and the exploration of one's own body and (4) sexuality and sexual impulses. The young person's relation with his or her own body and sexuality influences subjective experiences of GD. The experiences are always mediated in relation with other people and societal norms, and they are both long-lasting and changing. Conclusion: The phenomenological analysis indicated that GD is a complex phenomenon involving manifold factors that changes across time and place for each individual. GD is not a static phenomenon but an expression of continuous negotiation amongst the body, its impulses, sexual desire and the relationships in which each person participates. Therefore, clinicians who treat TGNC youth should help them to reflect on this developmental process over time as a complement to medical approaches.",2021-07-01,Journal,Review,Social Science and Medicine,18983,1,281,Navigating in the dark: Meta-synthesis of subjective experiences of gender dysphoria amongst transgender and gender non-conforming youth,1,true,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114094,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2021.0,43.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A meta-synthesis of qualitative research on subjective experiences of gender dysphoria amongst transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth indicated that GD is a complex phenomenon involving manifold factors that changes across time and place for each individual.'}",413,114118805,R.

415,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdBackground: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) may have long-lasting effects on late life health, probably through life-course mediators. However, whether such effects still exist when these mediators have been appropriately controlled is unclear. Objectives: To estimate the controlled direct effect of ACEs on Activities of Daily Life (ADL) disability in middle-aged people and examine the gender-difference of this effect. Participants and setting: We used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of persons aged 45+ years. Methods: ACEs were measured by the Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire and number of ACEs was classified as 0, 1, 2 and 3+, while ADL disability was measured using the Katz Index. Gender-specific controlled direct effects of ACEs on the incidence of ADL disability were estimated by marginal structural model (MSM) with stabilized inverse-probability-of-treatment weights of mediators (unhealthy behaviors, chronic diseases and depression). Results: 4,544 males and 4,767 females were included. Gender differences existed in most categories of ACEs, and about 10 % participants had 3+ ACEs. Participants who had 3+ ACEs had 39 % and 59 % higher risk of ADL disability than those with 0 ACEs among males and females, respectively. After controlling for the mediators, the direct effect was slightly increased in males (risk ratio (RR) = 1.45, p < 0.001) but decreased in females (RR=1.28, p < 0.05).

416,"© The Author(s) 2021.The aim of the article is to examine if and how the welfare state regime typology translates into a violence regime typology in a European context. It builds on the concept of violence regimes (Strid et al. 2017; Hearn et al. 2020) to empirically examine whether the production of interpersonal violence constitutes distinct regimes, and how these correspond (or not) with welfare regimes, gender regimes, and with other comparative metrics on violence, gender equality and feminist mobilisation and transnational actors. Its main contribution is to operationalise the concept of violence regimes, thereby moving from theory to a first empirical measurement. By first constructing a new composite measure of violence, a Violence Regimes Index, based on secondary administrative and survey data covering the then 28 EU member states, countries are clustered along two axes of violence: ‘deadly’ violence and ‘damaging’ gender-based violence. This serves to examine if, and how, the production of gendered violence in different states constitutes distinct regimes, analogous to welfare state regimes, as well as to enable future research and further comparisons and contrasts, specifically related to violence and the welfare state. By providing an empirical measurement of violence regimes in the EU, the article then contributes further to the debates on welfare, welfare regimes, and violence. It specifically contributes with discussions on the extent to which there are different violence regimes, comparable to welfare regimes, and with discussions on the relevance of moving from thinking about violence as an institution within other inequality regimes, to thinking about violence as a macro-regime, a way of governing and ruling in its own right.

Environmental risk and prior victimization history impact concerns about personal safety. However, few studies include stalking as part of the victimization history. Two reasons studies may not include stalking are that adding more questions to a research assessment increases participant burden and measurement of stalking has not always been clear. The current study used a community sample of 2,719 men and women and a five-item stalking assessment to examine the prevalence and impact of stalking and stalking-related fear on concern about personal safety, perceived vulnerability to an attack, perceptions that risk of victimization is higher due to personal characteristics, discomfort when thinking about safety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms controlling for victimization history, age, and environment risk by gender. Overall, 30% of women and 12% of men experienced stalking using the extreme fear standard which is double the national rates. Stalking-related fear, for both women and men, was associated with all of the outcome measures. Furthermore, there were significant main effects of gender after controlling for stalking-related fear on three of the outcomes consistent with the gender fear gap.

However, it has rarely been examined if childhood experiences—both negative and positive—have an effect on prison misconduct. We analyzed self-report data from more than 4,800 male and female adult prisoners in Germany to examine if childhood experiences of harsh parenting and parental warmth are associated with physical inmate-on-inmate violence. We also assessed the inmates’ attitude toward violence and examined if violence approval mediates the relationship between childhood experiences and violent misconduct. The results of the structural equation models show that both harsh parenting and positive, caring parental behavior have a small, but significant effect on violent prison misconduct, which is completely mediated by the inmates’ attitude toward violence. Furthermore, the results suggest that the same model holds for both male and female inmates, indicating that childhood victimization is not a gender-responsive need.

Published by BMJ.Objectives We synthesise evidence on sexual harassment from studies in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate its prevalence and conduct a meta-analysis of the association between sexual harassment and depressive symptoms. Methods We searched eight databases. We included peer-reviewed studies published in English from 1990 until April 2020 if they measured sexual harassment prevalence in LMICs, included female or male participants aged 14 and over and conceptualised sexual harassment as an independent or dependant variable. We appraised the quality of evidence, used a narrative syntheses approach to synthesise data and conducted a random effects meta-analysis. Results From 49 included studies, 38 focused on workplaces and educational institutions and 11 on public places. Many studies used an unclear definition of sexual harassment and did not deploy a validated measurement tool. Studies either used a direct question or a series of behavioural questions to elicit information on acts considered offensive or defined as sexual harassment. Prevalence was higher in educational institutions than in workplaces although there was high heterogeneity in prevalence estimates across studies with no international comparability. This posed a challenge for calculating an overall estimate or measuring a range. Our meta-analysis showed some evidence of an association between sexual harassment and depressive symptoms (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.76; p=0.016) although there were only three studies with a high risk of bias. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess measurement approaches and estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment across settings in LMICs. We also contribute a pooled estimate of the association between sexual harassment and depressive symptoms in LMICs.

It demonstrates that being misidentified as a predominant aggressor on a family violence intervention order can have a significant impact on women’s lives and their access to safety, highlighting the need for improved policing and court responses to the issue beyond existing reforms.",2021-06-16,Journal,Article,"International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy",21100407545,5,10,"‘I’m not at all protected and i think other women should know that, that they’re not protected either’: Victim–survivors’ experiences of ‘misidentification’ in Victoria’s family violence system",1,true,10.5204/IJCJSD.1992,Queensland University of Technology,,2021.0,39.0,0.0,,423,1381200066,E.

424,"© 2021 American Psychological AssociationObjective: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and gender minorities (GM) are more likely to have substance problems and experience various forms of victimization compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. Polyvictimization allows for the assessment of the combined impact of multiple forms of victimization on health. This study examines the effects of polyvictimization patterns on stimulant use, alcohol and marijuana problems among a large cohort study. Method: The sample was collected between 2015 and 2019 (n = 1,202). Mean age was 22. The sample was racially diverse (34.4% Black, 29.0% Hispanic/Latinx, 25.8% white, 5.9% other racial identity), 92.4% of the sample wereMSMand 7.6% of the sample were GM. Using latent class analysis five qualitatively different polyvictimization classes were identified. Associations between these classes and stimulant use, alcohol and marijuana problems were examined using negative binomial and logistic regressions. Results: Polyvictimization class significantly predicted alcohol problems and cannabis problems, at baseline as well as methamphetamine, and cocaine use at both time points. The polyvictimization profiles that were characterized by intimate partner violence (IPV), childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and high victimization across types were associated with substance outcomes at baseline. The polyvictimization class that was characterized by report of IPV was associated with cocaine use at 6 month follow-up. The polyvictimization class that was characterized by CSA was associated with methamphetamine use at 6 month follow-up. Conclusions: Researchers should examine the effects of victimization experiences more holistically and develop substance interventions that take multiple forms of victimization experiences into account",2021-06-03,Journal,Article,Psychology of Addictive Behaviors,25372,1,36,"Patterns of Polyvictimization Predict Stimulant Use, Alcohol and Marijuana Problems in a Large Cohort of Sexual Minority and Gender Minority Youth Assigned Male at Birth",1,true,10.1037/adb0000751,Educational Publishing Foundation,Psychology of Addictive Behaviors,2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Polyvictimization class significantly predicted alcohol problems and cannabis problems, at baseline as well as methamphetamine, and cocaine use at both time points, among a large cohort study.'}",424,1881221942,Casey D.

426,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Prior studies on adverse outcomes of parental corporal punishment on children have focused on examining one of two broad domains of parental corporal punishment: parental beliefs or actual use. Recently, researchers have argued that parental belief and actual use of corporal punishment should work jointly to contribute to children’s depression and involvement in school violence. Yet, studies supporting this proposition are lacking. This study examined the indirect link from parental attitudes towards corporal punishment to children’s depression and school violence involvement through actual use of corporal punishment. Four hundred and thirty-three elementary school students and their parents in Taiwan participated in this study. The results indicate that positive parental attitudes towards corporal punishment do not predict children’s depression and involvement in school violence. However, parental attitudes towards corporal punishment had significant indirect relationships with depression and involvement in school violence through the actual use of corporal punishment. These findings applied to both genders. This study supports the proposition that parental attitudes and the actual use of corporal punishment could work together to predict children’s depression and school violence. Future intervention programs for decreasing children’s depressive symptoms and involvement in school violence might need to tackle corporal punishment in the family.",2021-06-02,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,5,18,"Parental beliefs and actual use of corporal punishment, school violence and bullying, and depression in early adolescence",1,true,10.3390/ijerph18126270,MDPI,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2021.0,75.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The proposition that parental attitudes and the actual use of corporal punishment could work together to predict children’s depression and school violence is supported.'}",426,2109264059,Ji‐Kang Chen,2117470114,Zixin Pan,2143373489,Li-Chih Wang,,,,,,,65.0,1065.0,17.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,10.0,23.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,Medicine
427,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) partner notification services (HPN), peer mobilization with HIV self-testing, and acute and early HIV infection (AEHI) screening among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women (TGW) were assessed for acceptability, feasibility, and linkage to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services. Methods: Between April and August 2019, peer mobilizers mobilized clients by offering HIV oral self-tests and immediate clinic referral for clients with AEHI symptoms. Mobilized participants received clinic-based rapid antibody testing and point-of-care HIV RNA testing. Newly diagnosed participants including those derived from HIV testing services were offered immediate ART and HPN. Partners were recruited through HPN. Results: Of 772 mobilized clients, 452 (58.5%) enrolled in the study as mobilized participants. Of these, 16 (3.5%) were HIV newly diagnosed, including 2 (0.4%) with AEHI. All but 2 (14/16 [87.5%]) initiated ART. Thirty-five GBMSM and TGW were offered HPN and 27 (77.1%) accepted it. Provider referral identified a higher proportion of partners tested (39/64 [60.9%] vs 5/14 [35.7%]) and partners with HIV (27/39 [69.2%] vs 2/5 [40.0%]) than index referral. Of 44 enrolled partners, 10 (22.7%) were newly diagnosed, including 3 (6.8%) with AEHI. All 10 (100%) initiated ART. PrEP was initiated among 24.0% (103/429) mobilized participants and 28.6% (4/14) partners without HIV.

However, in some cases, controlling and aggressive behaviors can occur in the context of virtual interactions in couples; this is known as cyber-dating abuse (CDA). Identifying factors linked to CDA, as perpetrator and victim, are relevant for its prevention; therefore, more research is needed in this novel field of study. To contribute to the literature, our first goal was to analyze the associations among certain risk factors for CDA perpetration and victimization of, i.e., sexist attitudes and violence justification, problematic smartphone usage and impulsivity; sex and age were also considered. The second goal was to study whether there were differences in direct aggression and control, from the perpetrator and victim perspectives, with consideration of the above-mentioned risk factors. Third, differences in the diverse range of control behaviors and direct aggression between women and men were explored. To this end, 697 young adults (aged between 18 and 35 years; 548 women) completed self-report questionnaires that allowed assessment of the above-mentioned variables. The results showed that, among the wide range of CDA behaviors, indirect ones such as control behaviors were the most common. The highest level of control was strongly associated with the inability to manage behaviors under certain emotional states, especially negative ones, along with problematic smartphone usage. Sex differences were also observed: Men displayed more sexist attitudes and violence justification, and perceived that they were more controlled by their partners. Regarding CDA behaviors, men and women showed differences in control (e.g. men considered themselves to be more controlled in terms of location and status updates), and direct aggression (e.g. men used more insults and humiliations than women). The results were discussed in terms of the importance of better understanding these risk factors to attenuate the increasing prevalence of CDA in relationships.",2021-06-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,7,16,"Cyber-dating abuse in young adult couples: Relations with sexist attitudes and violence justification, smartphone usage and impulsivity",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0253180,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2021.0,85.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results showed that, among the wide range of CDA behaviors, indirect ones such as control behaviors were the most common and the highest level of control was strongly associated with the inability to manage behaviors under certain emotional states, especially negative ones, along with problematic smartphone usage.'}",428,40260529,Rocío Linares,1665397314,María Aranda,2092278734,M.

The aim of this study is to determine whether the presence of sexist attitudes, double standards and/or romantic myths contributes to the risk of gender violence. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at five secondary schools in the province of Malaga (Spain). In total, 879 adolescents aged 12–18 years were included, studying years 1–4 of compulsory secondary education. Their attitudes were measured on the following scales: Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), Double Standard Scale (DSS) and Romantic Love Myths Scale (EMA). Results: Significant differences were observed among the age/year groups for the mean scores obtained on each of the above scales (DSS, p < 0.01; EMA, p < 0.01; ASI, p < 0.01). By gender, the boys recorded higher scores for ASI and lower ones for DSS (p < 0.01). The Spearman’s rho value revealed significant relationships between the presence of sexual double standards and that of romantic myths and ambivalent attitudes (p < 0.01).

Empirical inquiries focus on its prevalence, those who are most at risk, and associated mental health effects and frequently include all-male samples. Studies also tend to narrowly measure PV as incidents of physical force or fatal encounters. Our study examined these gaps in knowledge by exploring police neglect and psychological, physical, and sexual violence perpetrated by police to examine how these forms of PV relate to perceptions of police legitimacy/trust, police effectiveness, and police performance. Method: Using data from the 2017 Survey of Police-Public Encounters—a cross-sectional, demographically representative survey of adults in Baltimore, MD, and New York, NY (N = 1, 000)—we assessed detailed forms of PV using the Police Practices Inventory. Results: Regression results indicated that most forms of PV were significantly and inversely associated with police perceptions. Individuals exposed to PV who were younger, female, had lower levels of education and income, identified as a racial/ethnic minority, and were born in the United States held more negative police perceptions.

434,"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Background Chemsex (drug use to enhance sex) has emerged among men who have sex with men (MSM). Non-consensual sex (NCS) is hypothesised to occur frequently under the influence of chemsex, however data are scarce. In this cross-sectional study, it was aimed to assess whether NCS is associated with chemsex. Methods We offered a survey about chemsex in the past 6 months (crystal methamphetamine, mephedrone and/or gamma-hydroxybutyrate/gamma-butyrolacton use) and NCS (sexual experiences beyond one's limits or unpleasant sexual experiences) in the past 5 years to Amsterdam-located gay dating platform users. Associations were assessed using χ test, Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression. Results Of 891 participants, 30.6% (273 of 891) engaged in chemsex; 21.2% engaging and 16.7% not engaging in chemsex reported any NCS experiences (p=0.109). Among MSM who reported any NCS experiences, chemsex engagers reported being touched against one's will less often compared with non-engagers (22.4% vs 39.8%; p=0.036). Yet, chemsex engagers reported passing out and not remembering what happened during drug use more often (41.4% vs 8.7%; p<0.001). The level of suffering from NCS experiences did not differ between chemsex engagers and non-engagers (p=0.539); and was rated by most participants with no suffering at all or low suffering (77.1%). In the multivariable regression analyses, chemsex engagement in the past 6 months was associated with NCS (adjusted OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11). Conclusions A substantial proportion of MSM (regardless of chemsex engagement) reported NCS in the past 5 years. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, chemsex engagement was associated with an NCS experience.

The majority of the perpetrators were well known to the victims in both groups. In both groups, we observed genital injuries in 1 of 3 patients. We found a strong association between the presence of genital injuries and a positive screening test for sexually transmitted diseases, in particular with regard to the adolescent victims. Conclusion: Adolescents’ delayed disclosure of sexual violence may affect the ability to properly manage these crimes. Prevention programs and public awareness campaigns should be implemented to highlight the importance of a prompt disclosure after sexual assault has occurred.

437,"© 2020, The Author(s).Visibility for transgender and gender nonconforming people and the elderly is growing; however, thus far the overlap of the two groups has rarely been considered. Trans persons therefore remain largely invisible in the context of older people’s care and medicine. The discrimination faced by this group is at least twofold: they are the targets of aggression incited by transphobia, and also by ageism. Although older trans and gender nonconforming people exist as a greatly marginalized group within another already marginalized group, even the field of theological ethics has neglected to grant them ethical attention. This leads to especially harsh consequences for elderly transgender and gender nonconforming people due to their specific vulnerabilities. There are reports from trans persons who have resolved never to make use of health services again due to regular experiences of transphobia in medical settings. There are religious components within transgender and gender nonconforming issues that should not be overlooked in this context. On the one hand, medical staff, in the name of their Christian beliefs, have refused to provide trans persons with basic medical care. On the other hand, demands for places of visibility, and spaces for the individual, are regularly made in trans-positive studies, and can be linked to discussions within theological ethics about giving space. Some ethical formulas within the Hebrew and Christian traditions focus on the creation of space in which other beings may exist, as found in concepts like brother–sisterhood, friendship, and Sabbath. By casting light on elderly trans and gender nonconforming people, and on their demands for space, via reflections on ethical concepts of space-making, this study develops a specific understanding of space for elderly trans persons. The paper aims to develop an understanding of trans-positive spaces within theological ethics and applied ethics. Spaces that assume a withdrawal or contraction by all those who have previously taken up trans spaces through ignorance, contempt, or violence, should not thereby become spaces of absence: indeed, elderly trans and gender nonconforming people might be in need of both kinds of spaces, those where otherness enables withdrawal, and those where the helping presence of others continues.",2021-06-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Religion and Health,27339,0,60,"Demand for Space: Elderly Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People, Healthcare, and Theological Ethics",1,true,10.1007/s10943-020-01101-9,Springer,Journal of religion and health,2020.0,81.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The paper aims to develop an understanding of trans-positive spaces within theological ethics and applied ethics, and casts light on elderly trans and gender nonconforming people, and on their demands for space, via reflections on ethical concepts of space-making.'}",437,2055806772,Mathias Wirth,,,,,,,,,,,16.0,27.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Medicine, Sociology"
438,"© 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and MedicinePurpose: Sexual and gender minority adolescents report higher levels of dating violence compared with their heterosexual and cisgender peers. The objectives of the present study were to (1) identify latent profiles of dating violence; (2) examine if sexual and gender minority adolescents were particularly vulnerable to certain profiles of dating violence; and (3) explore how experiences of peer victimization, discrimination, and parental maltreatment explained this greater vulnerability. Methods: High school students in Grades 9 and 11 from the 2016 Minnesota Student Survey (N = 87,532; mean age = 15.29 years, SD = 1.23) were asked about their sexual and gender identities, their gender nonconformity, their experiences of verbal, physical, and sexual dating violence victimization and perpetration, as well their experiences of childhood maltreatment, peer victimization, and gender-based and sexual minority status–based discrimination. Results: Multinomial logistic regression analysis in a three-step latent class analysis procedure suggested five profiles of dating violence victimization and perpetration across the entire sample. Sexual and gender minority adolescents were generally more likely to be in classes high in dating violence victimization, perpetration, or both, compared with their heterosexual and cisgender peers. Gender nonconformity was also associated with greater risk for being in high dating violence classes. These differences, however, were generally nonsignificant when the social stressors of childhood maltreatment, peer victimization, and experiences of discrimination were accounted for.

In Study 1 (n = 329), male collective narcissism was associated with sexism. This relationship was sequentially mediated by precarious manhood and traditional gender beliefs. In Study 2 (n = 877), Catholic collective narcissism predicted tolerance of violence against women (among men and women) over and above religious fundamentalism and in contrast to intrinsic religiosity. In Study 3 (n = 1070), national collective narcissism was associated with hostile sexism among men and women and with benevolent sexism more strongly among women than among men. In contrast, national in-group satisfaction—a belief that the nation is of a high value—predicted rejection of benevolent and hostile sexism among women but was positively associated with hostile and benevolent sexism among men.

442,"© The Author(s) 2018.Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) college students experience disproportionate rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) compared with their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. Some studies report rates of IPV among lesbian, gay, and bisexual college students as high as 50%, and 9 times greater among transgender students compared with their cisgender peers. Few studies have investigated the impact of intersectional identity on experiencing different types of IPV, such as emotional, physical, and sexual IPV. The present study utilized the National College Health Assessment–II from 2011 to 2013 (n = 88,975) to examine the differences in types of IPV among college students based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and the intersection of these two identities. Bivariate Rao–Scott chi-square and multilevel logistic regression was used to test the associations between sexual orientation, gender identity, and the intersection of these identities on multiple types of IPV. Adjusting for covariates and school clustering, LGBT college students had higher odds of reporting emotional IPV (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 1.34-1.99), physical IPV (AOR = 1.58-2.93), and sexual IPV (AOR = 1.41-6.18). Bisexual and transgender college students demonstrated the highest odds of reporting IPV based on sexual orientation and gender identity, respectively. Intersectional identities were not significantly associated with IPV. These findings demonstrate a need for clinicians working with college students to be aware of the disproportionate prevalence of IPV among LGBT individuals, particularly for those clients those who identify as bisexual and/or transgender and participate in continuing education related to these populations.

443,"© The Author(s) 2018.Prior research has explored victim blaming in the context of hate, often depicting hate crime victims as relatively passive recipients of harassment and violence. In reality, victims often do engage with their perpetrators, and the present research explored the effect that victim behavior might have on observer reactions to Islamophobic hate crimes. Participants completed a measure of Islamophobia and read a scenario in which a White man verbally harassed a victim in the park before physically assaulting him. We manipulated both the victim’s identity (White or South Asian Muslim) and the victim’s response to the perpetrator’s verbal harassment (the victim either ignored the offensive comments, verbally reacted to them, or became physically confrontational). When the victim was portrayed as passive and nonresponding, the South Asian Muslim victim attracted lower victim blame, higher perpetrator blame, and increased certainty that the offense was a hate crime. As the victim’s behavior became more aggressive, victim blaming increased and perpetrator blaming decreased, but only for the South Asian Muslim victim. It appeared that observers scrutinized the behavior of the South Asian Muslim victim in a way they did not for the White victim, such that sympathy toward the Muslim hate crime victim was tied to his “good behavior.” We propose that observers hold expectations of the model hate crime victim, one who is a racialized, religious, or sexual minority who accepts harassment passively and with good behavior; deviation from this script results in a loss of sympathy and an increase in victim blaming. Finally, those higher in Islamophobia displayed reduced perpetrator blame, guilt, and sentences but greater victim blame when the crime targeted a South Asian Muslim as opposed to White victim.",2021-06-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,4,36,Model Victims of Hate: Victim Blaming in the Context of Islamophobic Hate Crime,0,false,10.1177/0886260518805097,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2018.0,64.0,0.0,,443,51460522,Caroline A.

444,"© The Author(s) 2018.Child-to-parent violence has been defined as any act used by children to gain power and control by generating fear in their parents and that seeks to cause physical, psychological, and/or financial harm to their parents. This behavior puts family safety at risk due to the imbalance of power that it generates. For this reason, most abused parents feel guilty and humiliated. Child-to-parent violence has been historically underresearched compared with other studies about family violence. Most of the research conducted on this topic has been carried out in Europe and North America in the least decades. Nevertheless, in Chile, the research about child-to-parent violence has been really insufficient. This article presents the first analysis conducted in Chile regarding the prevalence of violent adolescent behavior toward parents. A total of 1,861 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 20 (M = 16.1, SD = 1.29) participated in the study (48.1% boys; 51.9% girls). Participants answered an ad hoc questionnaire on child-to-parent violence. Our findings indicate that psychological, economic, and physical aggression against the mother was more frequent than against the father. Daughters are more likely to use psychological aggression toward their fathers and mothers, whereas sons are more likely to use financial and physical aggression. Young people living in single-parent families are more likely to use financial and psychological aggression toward their mother.

445,"© The Author(s) 2018.The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) in an emergency department (ED) by sexual orientation and gender identification. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult patients (n = 1,136) presenting to a Level I Trauma Center ED from November 2015 to November 2016. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of reporting any IPV or IPV subtypes (physical or sexual IPV or battering) by sexual orientation and gender identification, controlling for confounders. Overall, 11.6% (132 / 1,136) of those surveyed were IPV positive. The prevalence of IPV was significantly higher in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) patients than in heterosexuals (18.3% vs. 10.8%, p =.0151); prevalence was highest among bisexuals (21.6%) and gay men (18.5%). IPV prevalence did not differ significantly in females versus males (13.5% vs. 9.2%, p =.0872).

446,"© The Author(s) 2018.The purpose of this article is to explore some underlying mechanisms of women’s psychological aggression in intimate partner violence (IPV), as a phenomenon that requires better understanding and intervention, even in cases when it does not lead to physical violence. Psychological aggression is known to be the most prevalent pattern of IPV for both genders, and its impact on many survivors is known to be equal and sometimes worse than that of physical harm. Despite the fact that most aggressive conflicts between couples do not escalate into physical violence, research mainly addresses psychological aggression in the context of its correlation with it. This article is based on qualitative interviews with 30 women who were in bidirectional abusive heterosexual relationships, who were at least psychologically aggressive toward their male intimate partner, and who were willing to be interviewed about this experience. Results of the phenomenological psychological method of analysis of the interviews are presented, focusing on the women’s personal accounts for using psychological aggression. These accounts are further analyzed from two perspectives: (a) the bimodal classification of impulsive, as opposed to instrumental, aggression; and (b) the client’s perceived need-to-control the partner as opposed to the ability to exercise self-control.

447,"Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes any violence (physical, sexual or psychological/emotional) by a current or former partner. This review reflects the current understanding of IPV as a profoundly gendered issue, perpetrated most often by men against women. IPV may result in substantial physical and mental health impacts for survivors. Women affected by IPV are more likely to have contact with healthcare providers (HCPs) (e.g. nurses, doctors, midwives), even though women often do not disclose the violence. Training HCPs on IPV, including how to respond to survivors of IPV, is an important intervention to improve HCPs' knowledge, attitudes and practice, and subsequently the care and health outcomes for IPV survivors. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of training programmes that seek to improve HCPs' identification of and response to IPV against women, compared to no intervention, wait-list, placebo or training as usual. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and seven other databases up to June 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registries and relevant websites. In addition, we contacted primary authors of included studies to ask if they knew of any relevant studies not identified in the search. We evaluated the reference lists of all included studies and systematic reviews for inclusion. We applied no restrictions by search dates or language. Selection criteria: All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing IPV training or educational programmes for HCPs compared with no training, wait-list, training as usual, placebo, or a sub-component of the intervention. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures outlined by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, undertook data extraction and assessed risks of bias. Where possible, we synthesised the effects of IPV training in a meta-analysis. Other analyses were synthesised in a narrative manner. We assessed evidence certainty using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 19 trials involving 1662 participants. Three-quarters of all studies were conducted in the USA, with single studies from Australia, Iran, Mexico, Turkey and the Netherlands. Twelve trials compared IPV training versus no training, and seven trials compared the effects of IPV training to training as usual or a sub-component of the intervention in the comparison group, or both. Study participants included 618 medical staff/students, 460 nurses/students, 348 dentists/students, 161 counsellors or psychologists/students, 70 midwives and 5 social workers. Studies were heterogeneous and varied across training content delivered, pedagogy and time to follow-up (immediately post training to 24 months). The risk of bias assessment highlighted unclear reporting across many areas of bias. The GRADE assessment of the studies found that the certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes was low to very low, with studies often reporting on perceived or self-reported outcomes rather than actual HCPs' practices or outcomes for women. Eleven of the 19 included studies received some form of research grant funding to complete the research. Within 12 months post-intervention, the evidence suggests that compared to no intervention, wait-list or placebo, IPV training:. · may improve HCPs' attitudes towards IPV survivors (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.03; 8 studies, 641 participants; low-certainty evidence);. · may have a large effect on HCPs' self-perceived readiness to respond to IPV survivors, although the evidence was uncertain (SMD 2.44, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.37; 6 studies, 487 participants; very low-certainty evidence);. · may have a large effect on HCPs' knowledge of IPV, although the evidence was uncertain (SMD 6.56, 95% CI 2.49 to 10.63; 3 studies, 239 participants; very low-certainty evidence);. · may make little to no difference to HCPs' referral practices of women to support agencies, although this is based on only one study (with 49 clinics) assessed to be very low certainty;. · has an uncertain effect on HCPs' response behaviours (based on two studies of very low certainty), with one trial (with 27 participants) reporting that trained HCPs were more likely to successfully provide advice on safety planning during their interactions with standardised patients, and the other study (with 49 clinics) reporting no clear impact on safety planning practices;. · may improve identification of IPV at six months post-training (RR 4.54, 95% CI 2.5 to 8.09) as in one study (with 54 participants), although three studies (with 48 participants) reported little to no effects of training on identification or documentation of IPV, or both. No studies assessed the impact of training HCPs on the mental health of women survivors of IPV compared to no intervention, wait-list or placebo. When IPV training was compared to training as usual or a sub-component of the intervention, or both, no clear effects were seen on HCPs' attitudes/beliefs, safety planning, and referral to services or mental health outcomes for women. Inconsistent results were seen for HCPs' readiness to respond (improvements in two out of three studies) and HCPs' IPV knowledge (improved in two out of four studies). One study found that IPV training improved HCPs' validation responses. No adverse IPV-related events were reported in any of the studies identified in this review. Authors' conclusions: Overall, IPV training for HCPs may be effective for outcomes that are precursors to behaviour change. There is some, albeit weak evidence that IPV training may improve HCPs' attitudes towards IPV. Training may also improve IPV knowledge and HCPs' self-perceived readiness to respond to those affected by IPV, although we are not certain about this evidence. Although supportive evidence is weak and inconsistent, training may improve HCPs' actual responses, including the use of safety planning, identification and documentation of IPV in women's case histories.

448,"© 2021Background: Effective targeting of services requires that we establish which undergraduates are at increased risk of mental health problems at university. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems in undergraduates. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register. Eligible studies were assessed using the Quality of Prognostic Studies checklist and narratively synthesised. Pooled prevalence of depression and suicide-related outcomes, and associated risk factors (odds ratios) were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses. Results: Sixty-six eligible studies of varying quality were included in a narrative synthesis. The pooled prevalence of depression (eight studies; 13,790 participants) was 25% (95% CI 17%, 35%) and the pooled prevalence of suicide-related outcomes (four studies; 2,586 participants) was 14% (95% CI 0%, 44%). Thirteen studies contributed to meta-analytic syntheses of 12 depression-related and four suicide-related risk factors. Presenting with a current mental health problem, negative rumination, parent separation, experiences of sexual harassment and parental depression significantly predicted depression outcomes. Childhood adversity, baseline mental health problems and financial difficulties significantly predicted suicide-related outcomes. Limitations: Student mental health is a heterogeneous research area and is hampered by the use of imprecise terms, both for describing risk factors and mental health outcomes. These inconsistencies limit the extent to which datasets can be meaningfully synthesised. Conclusions: This review evidences the importance of a range of risk factors for poor undergraduate mental health. Interventions should be developed to target modifiable risk factors and prevent poor mental health outcomes.

Published by BMJ.Introduction Disasters triggered by climate and other natural hazards are increasing in frequency, severity and duration worldwide. Disasters disproportionately impact women and girls, with some evidence suggesting that violence against women and girls (VAWG) increases in disaster settings. Suggested risk factors for postdisaster VAWG include increased life stressors, failure of law enforcement, exposure to high-risk environments, exacerbation of existing gender inequalities and unequal social norms. We aim to systematically appraise the global literature on the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. Methods We conducted a systematic review using the following databases: Embase, Global Health, Medline, PubMed and Social Policy and Practice and searched grey literature. We included quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies published in English language that examined the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. We summarised the findings using a narrative synthesis approach. Results Of 555 non-duplicate records, we included a total of 37 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Among the quantitative studies, eight studies found a positive association between disaster exposure and increased VAWG, and four additional studies found positive associations with some violence types but not others. Qualitative findings offered insights into three hypothesised pathways: disaster exposure associated with (1) an increase of stressors that trigger VAWG; (2) an increase of enabling environments for VAWG and (3) an exacerbation of underlying drivers of VAWG. Conclusion As the first known global systematic review on the relationship between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG, this review contributes to the evidence base. We were limited by the quality of quantitative studies, specifically study designs, the measurement of variables and geographic scope. The severe health consequences of VAWG and increasing frequency of extreme events means that rigorously designed and better quality studies are needed to inform evidence-based policies and safeguard women and girls during and after disasters.",2021-05-06,Journal,Article,BMJ Global Health,21100898934,26,6,"Natural hazards, disasters and violence against women and girls: A global mixed-methods systematic review",1,true,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004377,BMJ Publishing Group,BMJ Global Health,2021.0,96.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The severe health consequences of VAWG and increasing frequency of extreme events means that rigorously designed and better quality studies are needed to inform evidence-based policies and safeguard women and girls during and after disasters.'}",450,66232159,A.

Male violence toward women is often considered a psychopathic trait that sometimes involves the woman’s homicide by her partner and, at other times, attempted homicide. This phenomenon has been studied by conducting interviews following Hare’s model with 92 men incarcerated under a compliance regime in a Spanish prison (Córdoba). The results detected six explanatory factors of IPA as a result of attempted homicide or homicide: criminal past and delinquency, impulsivity, the need to stand out from others, lack of empathy, manipulation of others, and instability in partner relationships.

In severe cases, some of those involved develop anxiety, depression, and suicidal tenden-cies. However, few studies focus on cyberbullying among Chinese college students. We aimed to understand the incidence of cyberbullying in social media and online games and its associated factors among college students in China. A cross-sectional STAR questionnaire survey was conducted for college students from the end of June to the beginning of July 2019. Selected via the method of cluster random sampling, students graded 1–5 (college) from two colleges in Shantou were invited to participate in the survey. Information was collected regarding respondents’ socio-demographic information, cyberbullying in social media and online games, self-esteem, anxiety symptoms, Internet addiction, etc. A binary logistic regression model was employed to use all significant variables tested using χ² test or t-test for estimating the effect of potential factors on cyberbullying among college students. Participants were 20.43 ± 1.513(X ± SD) years old, and the age range was 15 to 25 years old. 64.32% college students reported that they had suffered from cyberbullying, and 25.98% reported bullying others online during the semester. Gender, anxiety symptoms, Internet addiction, game time, and violent elements in games were associated with cyberbullying in social media and online games among college students in China.

454,"© 2021Subject: The objective of this study is to determine the violence experienced by women who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) due to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and their previous experiences of violence. Method: The descriptive study was conducted with 96 women. The data was analyzed in SPSS 17.0 statistics package program. Findings: The average age of the women is X = 35.33 ± 11.72, 35.4% of them are in the 31–40 age group, 69.6% are married, 44.8% are high school graduates, 60.4% are unemployed. It was determined that women who were IPV victims were exposed to violence by being beaten (punching, kicking etc.) at the highest rate (82.3%), and nearly half of them (47.9%) were injured in the head and neck regions. The vast majority of women (86.5%) have been subjected to violence before, only %13.5 of them stated that they experienced violence for the first time. It was found that the majority of women (69.8%) continued to live with the perpetrator after violence. Only three of the women (3.4%) attempted to initiate legal action, and the majority (76.5%) did not intend to take legal action. Conclusions: Healthcare professionals should be aware that most woman presenting to the ED with IPV has a history of violence before it, and that this will probably not be the last. Healthcare professionals should also consider the fact that the victims may be exposed to different types of violence at the same time.

Most research on this topic has been done on indigenous communities in Canada, Australia, the US, parts of Europe and New Zealand, leaving indigenous communities in other parts of the world largely unrepresented. This study focuses on alcohol and drug consumption among the Baka: a former hunter-gatherer society in southeastern Cameroon that has been facing drastic socio-ecological changes in the last five decades. During long-term fieldwork we collected ethnographic and empirical data by means of group and individual interviews among four Baka communities. By using a multivariable approach, we describe psychoactive substance use behaviors, its socio-cultural and political context, and consequences. Our findings show that 48% of men, 24% of women and 11% of children between five and 16 years old reported alcohol intake in the past 24 h. The use of Tramadol was also reported, including by children as young as five years old. Psychoactive substances were used for recreational purposes, as painkillers, and energy boosters. Substance abuse was related to health issues, especially problems with fertility, and to several household and social conflicts. Other factors related to substance abuse were Baka's marginalization and sexual exploitation of Baka women and girls. By discussing these matters, we hope to stimulate more research on similar problems in small-scale societies and to invite governments, human rights activists, and other important parties to take action.",2021-05-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,0,277,"Alcohol, drugs and sexual abuse in Cameroon's rainforest",1,true,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113929,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2021.0,63.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study focuses on alcohol and drug consumption among the Baka: a former hunter-gatherer society in southeastern Cameroon that has been facing drastic socio-ecological changes in the last five decades and hopes to stimulate more research on similar problems in small-scale societies.'}",455,7029030,S.

457,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe trans-Atlantic slave trade had, for long, been abolished and yet many countries of the world are experiencing the resurgence of slavery that manifests in several different forms. Because the Nigerian situation presents some peculiarities, this research therefore uniquely explored two underexplored but growing trends: (1) Unlawful confinement of girls in ‘baby factories’ (illegal clinics and orphanages) and (2) the exploitation of girls and women by the Boko Haram terrorist group. These were expounded within the framework of radical feminist theory. Although men are also victims, children and women have been the most at risk populations. As victims in the terrorist dens, girls and women suffer as economic-slaves, sex-slaves and suicide-mission-slaves. In the baby factories, they serve as economic-slaves, sex-slaves, procreation-slaves, and money-ritual-slaves. The choice of women in providing these services is a testament to the disproportionate economic and power relations (such as inequalities, poverty, social exclusion, exploitations, and obnoxious cultural practices) inherent in patriarchal societies. This was also explained within the contexts of women's vulnerability which intersects with national and human insecurity factors to further predict their never-ending victimisations and bondage. Thus, it was concluded that the two phenomena constitute aggression, violence and abuse largely targeted at children and women, with long-term traumatic effects on victims. The problem requires national and transnational security interventions to combat, involving inter-security agency and public-private partnership to scale up control measures and safeguard victims' rights.",2021-05-01,Journal,Review,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,3,58,Gender and modern-day slavery in Nigeria: A critical analysis of baby factory and terrorism,0,false,10.1016/j.avb.2021.101549,Elsevier Ltd,,2021.0,69.0,1.0,,457,2087408976,M.

DV against men is a problem often overlooked and associated with numerous stereotypes. This study examines gender differences of DV help-seekers and specificities related to men. Data were derived through structured face to face interviews specifically designed for this study which based on DV literature that included 3296 help-seeking interviewees who personally visited the Counseling Center for Domestic Violence Victims, Zagreb, Croatia. Mental health professionals collected data on gender differences of help-seekers, socio-demographic characteristics, types, and duration of violence, perpetrators, and types of interventions. Important predictors of the gender of DV help-seekers were age, educational level, marital status, and DV types, duration and reporting. Women were more commonly abused by current partners and men by parents. Female victims were more likely to seek help after years of sustaining DV while male victims would seek help after up to 6 months of abuse. Women were more often victims of physical, financial, and multiple-type abuse, and men were more likely to suffer psychological abuse. Men were less likely to report abuse to the police, and misdemeanor or felony courts, but they sought legal counseling. 25% of DV help-seekers were men. Gender differences between victims of DV were in the socio-demographic characteristics, types and duration of violence, and perpetrators.

Despite a recent focus on family and intimate partner violence in Australia, there is almost no Australian data on the frequency or nature of youth intimate partner abuse (YIPA). The current study sought to better understand the frequency and nature of YIPA in Australian adolescents. To this end, 423 participants aged between 14 and 18 from Victorian (Australian) high schools completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding experiences of perpetration and victimization in their most difficult intimate relationship. Results showed high rates of both YIPA victimization and perpetration among boys and girls who had been in intimate relationships. As was expected, verbally and psychologically aggressive behaviors were reported more frequently than physically or sexually aggressive actions. Mutual YIPA was detected more frequently than unidirectional YIPA, and most commonly involved high severity reciprocal aggression. The current study further confirmed that YIPA is a complex and heterogeneous issue, involving a range of behaviors, patterns of use, and severities. A gender-sensitive approach to the current study allowed for consideration of the similarities and differences between male and female experiences of YIPA.

462,"© The Author(s) 2018.Nonfatal strangulation between intimate partners represents an extreme controlling form of violent behavior, increasing the risk that intimate partner violence (IPV) becomes lethal. Guided by Dutton and Goodman’s conceptualization of coercive control, the present research explored the relation between death threats and subsequent nonfatal strangulation to amplify the credibility of those threats, using a large sample of IPV perpetrators (n = 6,488). Logistic regression analyses determined the relation between overt threats to a partner’s life during an initial incident arrest and subsequent nonfatal strangulation postincident arrest, accounting for perpetrator characteristics and assessed risk.

463,"© The Author(s) 2018.This research examines how binary gender (male or female) interacts with trans status (cis or trans) to determine rape myth acceptance (RMA), perceived similarity, victim empathy, and victim blaming. Utilizing vignette methodology with an acquaintance rape scenario with a heterosexual female victim, we analyze these variables using multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) and ordered logit regression. We find support for the argument that both harm avoidance and blame avoidance are operating to predict similarity, empathy, and victim blaming experienced by cisgender and transgender individuals. We argue that this is based on in-group identification from both gender identity and perceived likelihood of future victimization. Specifically, we find that cisgender men have the lowest rates of perceived similarity. Transgender women have the highest rates of empathy whereas cisgender women and trans men have lower rates of victim blaming than cisgender men.

Many social associations and governmental institutions have addressed this problem in different ways. In the context of computer science, some effort has been developed to deal with this problem through the use of machine learning approaches to strengthen the strategic decision making. In this work, a deep learning neural network application to identify gender-based violence on Twitter messages is presented. A total of 1,857,450 messages (generated in Mexico) were downloaded from Twitter: 61,604 of them were manually tagged by human volunteers as negative, positive or neutral messages, to serve as training and test data sets. Results presented in this paper show the effectiveness of deep neural network (about 80% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic) in detection of gender violence on Twitter messages. The main contribution of this investigation is that the data set was minimally pre-processed (as a difference versus most state-of-the-art approaches). Thus, the original messages were converted into a numerical vector in accordance to the frequency of word’s appearance and only adverbs, conjunctions and prepositions were deleted (which occur very frequently in text and we think that these words do not contribute to discriminatory messages on Twitter).

While previous studies have identified protective and risk factors, individual differences in gender roles have yet to be explored. Moving beyond sex, the present study aims to examine the ways in which gender roles influence exposure to workplace violence, professional quality of life, and wellbeing at work among child protection workers. A randomized sample stratified by sex of 301 Canadian child protection workers (male: 15.6%, female: 84.4%) completed validated questionnaires of gender roles, professional quality of life, and wellbeing at work. We assessed mean differences using analyses of covariances controlling for clinical experience and type of work. We then assessed the moderating effect of gender roles on other variables through hierarchical multiple linear regressions. Androgyny (high masculinity and high femininity) was associated with higher scores on positive indicators of professional quality of life and wellbeing at work. However, gender roles showed no significant moderating effect on the relationship between exposure to violence, professional quality of life, and wellbeing at work.

Site: Region of Murcia, Spain. Participants: A total of 1269 users of social networks belonging to the Millennials generation (19–38 years) and Generation X (39–54 years) who are in a romantic relationship. Main measurements: The instrument “Questionnaire about new technologies to transmit gender violence”, analyzes the use of social networks, suffered and exercised violence on couples. The study variables have been the generational group, age, sex, alcohol and drug consumption, the level of formal education, origin and residence country and sexual orientation. Results: Millennials show a statistically significant association with the items on risk patterns in networks related to phising, sexting, flaming, false offers, cyberstalking, and webcam hijacking (p < 0.05), while regarding violence suffered only has been observed association in items related to flaming (OR: 0.405) (95% CI: 0.226–0.726) and sexual coercion (OR: 0.420) (95% CI: 0.200–0.882).

It is less clear if and to what extent substance use is associated with an increased risk in perpetrating cyber aggression, an emerging form of aggressive behavior that occurs through digital communication. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature resulted in 15 studies and 18 unique samples from which effect size estimates were calculated. Results: Analyses resulted in a moderate, significant mean observed correlation indicating that individuals who engaged in substance use were more likely than those who did not to perpetrate cyber aggression (r = 0.24, k = 18, 95% CI = 0.20, 0.28). Comparing data across types of substances revealed that alcohol use represents a stronger risk factor for cyber aggression than nicotine, cannabis, or other illicit drugs. Results also suggest a stronger relationship between substance use and cyber aggression among older than younger samples and in the context of intimate partner rather than peer aggression. Comparable estimates of substance-related cyber aggression emerged across types of cyber aggression and perpetrator gender.

Methods: Black women, aged 18–44 (n = 305) were recruited from STI clinics in Baltimore, MD into a retrospective cohort study. A survey assessed feminine gender ideologies using a measure of hyperfemininity and sexual hyperfemininity (subscale of sexual domains), harmful drinking (AUDIT), lifetime STI (Y/N and count), and syndemic burden (no burden [0−1 morbidity] and syndemic burden [2−3 comorbidities]). Multivariable regression models identified correlates of harmful drinking, STI, and syndemic burden. The analytic sample included (n = 231) women with complete data. Results: Nearly half of our sample reported high hyperfemininity and high sexual hyperfemininity, 23% reported harmful drinking, 39% experienced sexual violence as an adult, and 74% reported a lifetime STI.

Experiences of homophobic violence are associated with suicidal ideation. Yet, the specific mechanisms linking homophobic violence to suicidal ideation remain unclear. Entrapment and social belongingness were tested to determine their relevance for understanding the link between homophobic violence and suicidal ideation. A sample of sexual minority Dutch emerging adults (N = 675; ages 18–29, M = 21.93 years, SD = 3.20) were recruited through online platforms and flyers. Homophobic violence was expected to be positively associated with suicidal ideation and entrapment. The association between homophobic violence and suicidal ideation was expected to be indirectly linked through entrapment. We explored whether various sources of social belongingness moderated the path between entrapment and suicidal ideation and whether those sources of social belongingness moderated the indirect effect of homophobic violence on suicidal ideation through entrapment. Results showed that homophobic violence and entrapment were positively associated with suicidal ideation and that family belongingness was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Homophobic violence and suicidal ideation were not indirectly linked through entrapment. The interaction effect between entrapment and family belongingness was significant, suggesting that, on average, the effect of entrapment on suicidal ideation decreased when family belongingness was high.

Research on IPV in heterosexual couples, in particular on heterosexual women, has been prolific. However, there is a dearth of literature to document the distinct experiences of gay and bisexual men, despite the evidence of prevalence of IPV as reported equal or higher to heterosexual women. Studies have found that one in four gay men and four in 10 bisexual men have experienced IPV in their lifetime. This scoping review examines studies between 1931 and 2019 that had a predominant focus on violence among gay and bisexual men. Four electronic databases were searched in 2019. Arksey and O’Malley’s framework was utilized to extract 28 studies using a range of research designs that represented 13,224 sexual minority male participants. Across studies, gay and bisexual men were observed to experience IPV similarly to heterosexual couples involving psychological, physical, and sexual violence. However, as a marginalized and sexual minority group, they experience distinctive features of violence including sexual orientation outing, unprotected sexual intercourse, homophobia, internalized homophobia, and difficulties accessing minority men–focused services.

473,"© 2020Gender mainstreaming (GM) is a strategy to empower women and promote gender equality. Using mixed-methods, this study draws on perspectives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Armenia and Georgia to investigate NGOs’ resistance to, versus embrace of, GM in rural development and agriculture (electronic surveys, 215 NGOs; in-person interviews, 53 NGOs). Applying Bourdieu's theory of field-habitus, and intersectionality as critical praxis, we suggest that NGO leaders' social belonging along with field-related experiences explain how GM is understood and endorsed. In Armenia and Georgia, GM without intersectionality – the critical inclusion of rural women's empowerment and equality – enforces a reductionist interpretation of social classifications. Analysis reveals that social belonging of NGO leaders is a determinant for choosing constituents: female NGO leaders include rural women; male leaders, rural men. Field practices are pivotal for formal adoption of GM (e.g. adhering to funders’ requirements, affiliation to international NGOs, engagement in feminist activism). Concurrently, internalization of social power structures grounds NGO leaders' thinking about gender equality. Respondents express three distinct narratives on GM urgency depending upon leaders' gender and organizations' self-reported feminist orientation. First, only female leaders of self-identified feminist NGOs support GM necessity in response to economic and political shocks that reinforce patriarchal dynamics. For feminist NGOs, violence against women intertwines with other rural livelihood threats. Intersectionality as critical praxis guides addressing gender-based rural inequalities. Second, female leaders of non-feminist NGOs employ GM primarily to improve rural households' wellbeing by targeting women in unpaid and new ventures. Rural household vulnerability outweighs gender-based inequality concerns. Third, interviewed male NGO leaders do not identify as feminist. They grudgingly accept GM as funders’ burdensome requirement that, given other rural challenges, overemphasizes women's equality and engagement.

476,"© The Author(s) 2018.Totalitarian style partner control is seldom studied apart from intimate partner violence (IPV) independently as an outcome. This article uses a comparative study of Beijing and Seoul to begin to address this gap in the research. We collected three-stage probability proportional to size cluster samples of married/partnered women from Beijing (n = 301) and Seoul (n = 459), using refusal conversion to keep response rates high. We hypothesized (1) totalitarian style partner control will be positively associated with Confucian sex role norms at the (a) individual and (b) neighborhood levels, (2) totalitarian style partner control will be positively associated with IPV secrecy at the (a) individual and (b) neighborhood levels, and (3) totalitarian style partner control will be positively associated with the need for refusal conversion. Mixed effects (multilevel) regression models supported all three hypotheses at the individual level. Surprisingly, neighborhood socioeconomic status was positively associated with totalitarian style partner control. The combined data conceal important differences between Beijing and Seoul. The rate of totalitarian style partner control is more than 5 times higher in Seoul, and Confucian sex role norms, at both the individual and neighborhood levels, predict totalitarian style control there.

Yet trans people continue to face minority stressors, including structural violence (i.e., discrimination, violence, and stigma), which may interfere with the achievement of these milestones. Among trans women specifically, however, potential associations between gender developmental milestones and structural violence are not well characterized in the literature. In a sample of Filipinx (i.e., an inclusive term for describing non-binary genders in the Philippines) trans women who are sexually active with men (trans-WSM), we thus sought to: (a) describe the mean ages at which gender developmental milestones occur and (b) examine the associations between structural violence and mean ages at which at which Filipinx trans-WSM experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Methods Using data from Project #ParaSaAtin, an online survey of Filipinx trans-WSM (n = 139), we mapped age-estimates per trans-specific milestones and then tested whether structural violence is associated with the mean age at which trans women experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Results Overall, participants who reported higher levels of discrimination, stigma, and violence also experienced a later age for nearly each milestone (i.e., initial self-Awareness of transfeminine identity, transfeminine expression in private, transfeminine expression in public, first consensual oral/vaginal/anal sex with a cisgender male partner, first consensual oral/vaginal/ anal sex with a cisgender male partner as a trans women, and hormone integration) (all p-values 0.05). Of note, the single exception to this pattern was the non-significant association between stigma and initial disclosure of transfeminine identification to another person. Conclusion Results are consistent with psychological literature outlining a temporal sequence of developmental milestones among young trans-WSM.

481,"© The Author(s) 2018.Childhood gender nonconformity has been associated with numerous adverse experiences, including peer bullying and homophobic violence. However, little is known about gender nonconformity in the context of intimate relationships, independent of sexual orientation. This study aimed to examine associations between childhood gender nonconformity and intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescence and early adulthood. Using data from the 2007 wave of the U.S. Growing Up Today Study (N = 7,641, mean age = 22.8 years), we estimated risk ratios (RRs) for the association of gender nonconformity up to age 11 years and lifetime IPV victimization and perpetration. Models were adjusted for demographic characteristics, including sexual orientation identity. We assessed effect modification by gender and examined whether childhood abuse mediated the association between nonconformity and IPV. Males in the top decile of nonconformity were at elevated risk of IPV victimization (RR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 1.71]) and IPV perpetration (RR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.54, 3.56) compared with those below median nonconformity, adjusting for sexual orientation and demographic characteristics. There was no evidence of a similar association for females in the top decile of gender nonconformity. Childhood abuse did not mediate IPV disparities by gender nonconformity. We identify gender nonconformity as an important risk indicator for IPV victimization and perpetration among young adult males, independent of sexual orientation. Findings highlight the vulnerability of boys and men who do not conform to societal gender norms and the importance of studying gender expression as a determinant of violence. IPV prevention efforts may be improved with more explicit focus on socially constructed gender norms and support for diverse gender expressions.

483,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.Purpose of review: The evidence for association of alcohol and gender-based violence (GBV) is quite strong; however, the exact pathways of this association need further study. Areas that need more research include the role of alcohol in any type of intimate partner violence and the risks for violence when alcohol is combined with other psychoactive substances. This will help in developing targeted interventions for different groups. This paper aims at reviewing existing literature on alcohol-related GBV and intimate partner violence (IPV) and provide a reference for future research. Recent Findings: Alcohol plays an important role in perpetuation of gender violence and in coping with victimisation among women. It acts as a proximal factor along with distal factors like relationship problems in the perpetuation of gender-based violence. While the association of male-to-female violence and alcohol has been mostly studied, similar findings are also seen in female-to-male violence and among same-sex couples. It appears that patriarchy and power imbalance in societies add to the risk. The effects of other substances like cannabis and stimulants used along with alcohol have an additive effect on GBV. The role of alcohol-related policies like decreasing alcohol outlet density, prohibition, and increasing the minimum legal age for drinking have shown some evidence in reducing partner violence but cannot be generalised to all contexts. Summary: A gendered lens to view alcohol and its association with gender-based violence is vital for several of the above reasons, and hence, targeting alcohol use is necessary but may not be sufficient for violence prevention.

484,"© 2021Background: Transgender and gender-diverse people are at higher risk for drug use and drug use disorder than their cisgender peers. Theory and research have suggested that external minority stressors (e.g., discrimination, violence, and rejection) and internal minority stressors (e.g., internalized transphobia) may contribute to this health disparity. However, few studies have examined the proximal (e.g., same-day) association between minority stress and drug use. Methods: The present study tested the same-day association of external and internal minority stressors with use of drugs in a sample of 38 transgender and gender-diverse participants residing in two Southeastern cities. Participants reported their previous day's experiences with minority stress and drug use over the course of 30 days. A total of 836 daily surveys were collected (73.3 % compliance rate). Results: Multilevel modeling revealed that external minority stress (i.e., violence, harassment, discrimination, rejection), but not internalized stigma, was associated with increased odds of drug use on a given day, while controlling for time, same-day depressive affect and cognition, same-day gender dysphoria symptoms, demographics, and baseline levels of drug use.

The sample was stratified by gender and logistic regression models were fit to determine the adjusted odds of an identified need for domestic violence services. For both mothers and fathers, the strongest association was an additional need for mental health services. Age, education status, alcohol use, marijuana use, and a reported history of physical violence victimization were also associated with a need for domestic violence services among mothers, while race, age, marital status, annual income, alcohol use, cocaine use, and a reported history of physical violence perpetration were associated with a need for domestic violence services among fathers.

490,"© 2021 American Psychological AssociationSexual violence, including rape, is a pervasive problem on college campuses in the United States. Although men perpetrate the majority of sexual violence, men’s attitudes, experiences, and perspectives are not typically included in research on rape and sexual violence. We addressed this empirical gap through our mixed-methods analysis of 365 college-aged men’s definitions of the term “rape.” Our analysis via consensual qualitative research revealed that men’s definitions fit into nine primary domains: lack of consent, taken advantage of, sex, sexual activity, unwanted, gender/sex-specific, harm to victim, relationship, and emotional response, as well as a miscellaneous domain. Further, using chi-square tests of independence, we compared responses from men with and without histories of sexual violence perpetration. Findings showed that the definitions generated by men with a history of perpetration were less likely to include nonpenetrative sexual violence and were more likely to use gender/sex-specific language. We conclude that most young men have a generally accurate understanding of rape, though perpetrators’ understandings may be somewhat narrower and more limited than those without a history of perpetration. We end with recommendations for refocusing sexual education curricula to better aid in the prevention of sexual violence perpetration. Specifically, given that (most) men know what rape is, educators should emphasize the cultural and situational factors that make rape more likely so all people can reduce the risk of sexual violence and take proactive precautions to prevent it.

Measures of health anxiety, COVID-19 perceived dangerousness, negative affect, anxiety, depression, stress, contamination-related obses-sions and compulsions, and intrusive illness-related thoughts were administered online to 742 community individuals during the Italian national lockdown. Results showed that, after controlling for demographic variables and other internalizing problems, health anxiety was the single most important factor associated with the perceived dangerousness of COVID-19. Moreover, a comparison between the current sample’s scores on various symptom measures and scores from prepandemic Italian samples revealed that, whereas other internalizing symptoms increased by a large or very large magnitude during the pandemic, levels of health anxiety and negative affect increased by a medium amount. This result may indicate that health anxiety is relatively trait-like, increasing the likelihood that our correlational data support the model of health anxiety as a vulnerability rather than an outcome.

In this study, we aimed to analyse the prevalence and the psychosocial and socioeconomic risk and protective factors associated DV among male and female adolescents in Eu-rope. It was performed a cross-sectional study based on a non-probabilistic sample of 1555 students aged 13–16 years (2018–2019). The global prevalence of DV victimization was significantly greater among girls than boys (girls: 34.1%, boys: 26.7%; p = 0.012). The prevalence of DV in both girls and boys was greater for those over age 15 (girls: 48.5% p < 0.001; boys: 35.9%; p = 0.019). There was an increased likelihood of DV victimization among girls whose fathers did not have paid employment (p = 0.024), who suffered abuse in childhood, and reported higher Benevolent Sexism [PR (CI 95%): 1.01 (1.00–1.03)] and machismo [1.02 (1.00–1.05)].

Persistent stress stemming from anti-SGM stigma and prejudice may place SGM individuals at increased risk for negative mental health outcomes. This study ex-plored experiences with violence (intimate partner violence and SGM-based violence), mental health outcomes (psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and depressive symptoms), alcohol and other substance use, and prioritization of community needs among SGM adults in Western Kenya. Methods: This study was conducted by members of a collaborative research partnership between a U.S. academic institution and a Kenyan LGBTQ civil society organization (CSO). A convenience sample of 527 SGM adults (92.7% ages 18–34) was recruited from community venues to complete a cross-sectional survey either on paper or through an online secure platform. Results: For comparative analytic purposes, three sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) groups were created: 1) cisgender sexual minority women (SMW; 24.9%), 2) cisgender sexual minority men (SMM; 63.8%), and 3) gender minority individuals (GMI; 11.4%). Overall, 11.7% of participants reported clinically significant levels of psychological distress, 53.2% reported clinically significant levels of post-trau-matic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and 26.1% reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms. No statistically significant differences in clinical levels of these mental health concerns were detected across SOGI groups. Overall, 76.2% of participants reported ever using alcohol, 45.6% home brew, 43.5% tobacco, 39.1% marijuana, and 27.7% miraa or khat. Statistically significant SOGI group differences on potentially problematic substance use revealed that GMI participants were less likely to use alcohol and tobacco daily; and SMM participants were more likely to use marijuana daily. Lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV) was reported by 42.5% of participants, and lifetime SGM-based violence (SGMV) was reported by 43.4%. GMI participants were more likely than other SOGI groups to have experienced both IPV and SGMV. Participants who experienced SGMV had significantly higher rates of clinically significant depressive and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Despite current resilience demonstrated by SGM adults in Kenya, there is an urgent need to develop and deliver culturally appropriate mental health services for this population. Given the pervasiveness of anti-SGM violence, services should be provided using trauma-informed prin-ciples, and be sensitive to the lived experiences of SGM adults in Kenya.

494,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.(1) Background: Gender-based violence has no geographical, personal, or social boundaries. It constitutes a serious public health problem that affects the entire society. This research aims to identify and compare the level of ambivalent sexism in Spanish and Colombian university students and its relationship with sociodemographic factors. Ambivalent sexism, developed by Glick and Fiske (1996), is considered a new type of sexism since, for the first time, it combines negative and positive feelings that give rise to hostile and benevolent sexism, maintaining the subordination of women through punishment and rewards. (2) Methods: The methodology consisted of the application of the validated Spanish version of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) to a sample of 374 students in their final academic year of the Law program, of which 21.7% were students at the University of Santander (Bucaramanga, Colombia), 45.5% at the University Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain), and the remaining 32.9% at the University of Seville (Seville, Spain). (3) Results: A high level of ambivalent sexism is reported in Colombian students nowadays. In the two countries. there are similarities (e.g., the great weight of religion and the variation in attitudes towards sexism in people who identify themselves as women, compared to male or students consulted that prefer not to answer) and differences (e.g., absence in Colombia of gender-specific legislation, low number of students who have received gender education in Spain). (4) Conclusions: These findings may contribute to the construction of laws that take into account the particular problems of women and the development of educational programs on gender that are offered in a transversal and permanent way and that take into account cultural factors and equity between men and women as an essential element in the training of future judges who have the legal responsibility to protect those who report gender violence.",2021-02-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,2,18,Assessment of ambivalent sexism in university students in colombia and spain: A comparative analysis,1,true,10.3390/ijerph18031009,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2021.0,85.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The level of ambivalent sexism in Spanish and Colombian university students and its relationship with sociodemographic factors may contribute to the construction of laws that take into account the particular problems of women and the development of educational programs on gender.'}",494,2047656715,A.

This paper focuses on a key gender norm, namely, women's perception of experiencing domestic violence. Specifically, we investigate the impact of household access to remittance income on attitudes held by women in the household regarding the acceptability of domestic violence. Using data from a Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey conducted in the Punjab province of Pakistan in 2014, we isolate the causal impact of remittance income by employing a matching estimator to construct counterfactuals that allow us to compare women from otherwise identical households who differ solely in their access to remittances. Our results indicate that women in households with access to remittances are less likely to accept domestic violence than women in comparable households without remittance income, though there is considerable heterogeneity once we differentiate between different contexts for DV. Interestingly, the result persists even when we distinguish between transnational and domestic remittances, access to either type of transfer reducing the acceptance of domestic violence by comparable magnitudes.

Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial issues co-occur and interact, and thus increase sexual risk behaviour. Psychosocial issue identification, referral and management might reduce risk behaviour. Methods In the syndemic-based intervention study, an open-label randomised controlled trial, MSM were enrolled at the STI outpatient clinic of the Public Health Service of Amsterdam. We screened participants using validated questionnaires on the following problem domains: alcohol and substance use, sexual compulsivity, anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, alexithymia, intimate partner violence and childhood sexual abuse. Individuals were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tailored, face-to-face feedback and help-seeking advice on mental health screening, or no feedback and no help-seeking advice. Participants were followed trimonthly for a year. The primary outcomes were self-reported and confirmed help-seeking behaviour. Results We included 155 MSM: 76 in the intervention group and 79 in the control group. At inclusion, 128 participants (83.1%) scored positive in at least one problem domain. We found no significant differences in self-reported or confirmed help-seeking behaviour between the intervention and the control group: 41% vs 29% (p=0.14) and 28% vs 22% (p=0.44), respectively. There were also no differences in STI incidence and condomless anal sex acts between the two groups.

501,"© The Author(s) 2017.Violence against Women (VaW) has come to be recognized as a serious human rights abuse with important consequences not only for women but for whole societies. Since VaW has several manifestations, it is possible to differentiate among different types of violence. In this article, a broad theoretical framework with different dimensions of gender violence was adapted to a Latin American social and cultural context to measure three out of the five main types of violence: economic violence, emotional psychological violence, and coercive control. The goal of this article is to provide empirical evidence to determine whether access to microfinance services plays a role in reducing VaW. To this end, we designed and performed a cross-sectional study with a treatment and a control group in rural Guatemala. A sample of 883 rural women in the “Altiplano” area of Guatemala (448 women with microfinance services and 435 without) was surveyed from May to November 2012. The results of the bivariate logistic regression showed evidence of association between access to microfinance services and reduction of VaW. After adjusting for covariates, global, economic, and emotional psychological violence maintained a negative and statistically significant association with microfinance, while only coercive control showed no statistical association with microfinance services. Access to microcredits showed a very clear relationship to reducing economic and emotional violence but not coercive control, a factor that may be determined by social and cultural norms. In contrast to Status Inconsistency Theory, which has been tested primarily in Asia, our study of Guatemala showed that increased status and economic independence of women due to their participation in microfinance services reduced VaW.",2021-02-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,5,36,Microfinance and Violence Against Women in Rural Guatemala,0,false,10.1177/0886260517738780,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2017.0,84.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A study of Guatemala showed that increased status and economic independence of women due to their participation in microfinance services reduced VaW, in contrast to Status Inconsistency Theory.'}",501,32109216,Isabel Cepeda,1404975289,M.

Second, we examined whether perspective-taking and empathy each moderated the association between FOA and electronic dating aggression and explored the moderating role of gender. Participants included 359 undergraduate students (50% female; 42% White) from an urban university. Results indicated that greater FOA during childhood was associated with perpetrating greater electronic aggression against romantic partners. Furthermore, significant interactions indicated that perspective-taking and empathy separately buffered these associations. Youth from aggressive families did not exhibit increased electronic dating perpetration when they had higher perspective-taking or empathy.

504,"© The Author(s) 2017.Knowledge on young adults’ perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV) is important as these are the ages at which most people form their first serious intimate relationships and begin to develop norms about how to communicate within a relationship. This study uses an experimental vignette design to examine whether the type of violence employed and the gender dynamics within the couple (male perpetrator and female victim vs. female perpetrator and male victim) affect young adults’ perceptions of IPV normality. Gender differences in these perceptions are assessed and moreover, we explore whether these differences can be attributed to respondents’ prior IPV experiences. Young adults (N = 599) were recruited from various schools and universities throughout the Netherlands. They were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental vignettes. Findings demonstrate that, generally, scenarios describing more serious types of IPV as well as those describing a male perpetrator and a female victim received lower ratings of normality. Gender differences in perceptions were found and, moreover, the direction of these gender differences appeared to depend on the actual gender dynamics described in the IPV scenario. Prior IPV experiences increased perceptions of IPV normality among female respondents in particular. Moreover, the suggestion that respondents’ prior IPV experiences may better explain respondents’ IPV perceptions than respondents’ gender, was only partly supported. Our findings suggest that this is true for respondents’ prior psychological, but not physical IPV experiences and for the manipulations of the gender dynamics within the couple, but not so much for the type of violence employed.

In spite of this, studies investigating attitudes toward violence and their correlates among participants drawn from the region are missing. To address this void in the literature, we examined associations between violence exposure and victimization and two gender-based violence-related cognitions (attitudes toward male physical domestic violence and social norms regarding physical violence against girls) as well as general beliefs about violence using structural equation modeling. Participants were a sample of adolescent girls (n = 661; M age = 13.15) and boys (n = 639; M age = 13.22) from two Eastern Caribbean countries, Barbados and Grenada, recruited from 10 primary schools, nine secondary schools, and two youth offender centers. In considering that girls and boys were previously demonstrated to differ in their experiences as well as tolerance of violence, structural models were specified and tested separately for the two sexes. Results indicated that violence victimization was positively strongly associated with attitudes toward male physical domestic violence and social norms regarding physical violence against girls among boys. Increased violence victimization among girls, in turn, correlated with increased acceptance of social norms regarding physical violence against girls, but this relationship was weak.

Design/methodology/approach: Participants (n = 15) were female police officers working in a specialist sexual offences investigation unit in a large English Metropolitan Police Force. A semi-structured interview was employed to elicit their experiences as an example of “extreme” police work. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to develop themes elucidating psychological and physical impacts on officers and their coping strategies. Findings: Personal consequences were framed within the conceptualisation of secondary trauma. Emergent findings revealed profound and lasting vicarious traumatisation. Participants reported feelings of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, intrusive imagery, altered beliefs and cognitions as well as disrupted intimacy with partners. Coping adaptations included sensory shutdown, avoidance, dissociation and a reduction in victim care. Practical implications: The findings support the need to consider occupational interventions to address risk factors associated with caseload, tenure, personal experience of neglect (e.g. in childhood), and the permeability of work and family boundaries for such exceptional policing tasks. Originality/value: The paper contributes to a nascent literature on stress in “extreme” police work.

Comorbid depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are typical psychiatric consequences of GBV. Despite attention to the HIV-GBV syndemic, few HIV clinics offer formal mental healthcare. This problem is acute in sub-Saharan Africa, where the world’s majority of HIV–positive women live and prevalence of GBV is high. Methods and findings We conducted a randomized controlled trial at an HIV clinic in Kisumu, Kenya. GBV-affected HIV–positive women with both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD were randomized to 12 sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) plus treatment as usual (TAU) or Wait List+TAU. Nonspecialists were trained to deliver IPT inside the clinic. After 3 months, participants were reassessed, and those assigned to Wait List+TAU were given IPT. The primary outcomes were diagnosis of MDD and PTSD (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included symptom measures of depression and PTSD, intimate partner violence (IPV), and disability. A total of 256 participants enrolled between May 2015 and July 2016. At baseline, the mean age of the women in this study was 37 years; 61% reported physical IPV in the past week; 91% reported 2 or more lifetime traumatic events and monthly income was 18USD. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression showed that participants randomized to IPT+TAU had lower odds of MDD (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, 95% CI [0.11 to 0.60], p = 0.002) and lower odds of PTSD (OR 0.35, [0.14 to 0.86], p = 0.02) than controls. IPT+TAU participants had lower odds of MDD-PTSD comorbidity than controls (OR 0.36, 95% CI [0.15 to 0.90], p = 0.03). Linear mixed models were used to assess secondary outcomes: IPT+TAU participants had reduced disability (−6.9 [−12.2, −1.5], p = 0.01), and nonsignificantly reduced work absenteeism (−3.35 [−6.83, 0.14], p = 0.06); partnered IPT+TAU participants had a reduction of IPV (−2.79 [−5.42, −- 0.16], p = 0.04). Gains were maintained across 6-month follow-up. Treatment group differences were observed only at month 3, the time point at which the groups differed in IPT status (before cross over). Study limitations included 35% attrition inclusive of follow-up assessments, generalizability to populations not in HIV care, and data not collected on TAU resources accessed.

508,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Violence against women with disabilities is a social problem with important consequences for their physical and mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared violence against women as a public health priority issue in 1996 and the fact that violence is used by the intimate partner and upon women with disabilities exacerbates the situation. Therefore, this is an issue that must be addressed from a public health viewpoint. Violence is studied from various aspects: Physical, psychological, sexual, or social control, and its multiple consequences in women’s health and the use of health services. In this perspective, with the data from the VI Violence against Women Macro-survey 2019 (VWM-2019) and adjusted to Spain, this study examines the incidence of intimate partner violence and its consequences in the health of women with disabilities and its impact on health services.

509,"© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the current literature which assesses the incidence of completed or attempted mass shooting events in which a female party acted either alone or as an accomplice; explore the involvement of women in the planning or execution of acts of terrorism; evaluate the pathology of women involved in these acts of extreme violence; highlight any gender-specific pathological and environmental risk factors associated with the planning or completion of the mass shooting, spree killing or terrorist attack events. Design/methodology/approach: Using the 27-item preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (Moher et al., 2009), the present systematic review explored peer-reviewed literature published between 1908 and September 2020 using six databases [SalfordUniversityJournals@Ovid; Journals@Ovid Full Text; APA PsycArticles Full Text; APA PsycExtra; APA PsycInfo; Ovid MEDLINE(R)], in addition to conducting a grey literature search on “Google Scholar” using specific search terms, predetermined following use of the patient/population, intervention, comparison framework. Findings: Findings of the review did identify several distinguishing characteristics exclusive to women allied to terror organisations; including lower levels of extremism and religious ideology, lower age of radicalisation, higher levels of education than currently hypothesized and the significance of relational affiliation with extremist causes. Despite the synthesis of descriptive characterises being achieved, data relating to female mass shooters was scant and relied upon case study review and discussion. As a result, identification of precipitating psychopathological and environmental triggers was difficult, however, there does appear to be a higher proportion of female mass shooters targeting current or previous places of employment. Research limitations/implications: One of the potential limitations of this review is that some relevant studies were not identified during the search. The risk of this was minimised as much as possible by screening the reference section of relevant reviews and theoretical papers (which were identified in the search of the databases) for any potentially relevant studies that may have been missed. In addition, numerous permutations of the search criteria that were entered into the databases were also entered into “GoogleScholar”. Practical implications: Current literature has highlighted that the age of radicalisation among women across both jihadi-inspired, right-wing and far-left extremist organisations are decreasing, with many new recruits being born after 1990 (Jacques and Taylor, 2012). This finding aids in identifying a target of entry to minimise the chance of radicalisation, through targeted educational training and anti-radicalisation programmes intervening in at risk groups at the correct time. However, further exploration will be necessary to identify specific risk factors prior to radicalisation in such groups. Originality/value: There appears to be a large gap in literature quantitively assessing the rates of psychopathological variables among this demographic. When narrowing the lens further onto female mass shooters, empirical literature investigating even characteristic variables continues to evade the academic remit. Arguably this obstruction to the current understanding of female perpetrated violence, both in an organised terror and a mass shooter capacity, limits the ability to meaningfully evaluate whether previous models assessing risk among mass shooters is valid across genders.",2021-01-01,Journal,Review,Journal of Criminal Psychology,21100370349,0,11,Exploring female involvement in acts of terrorism and mass shootings: a systematic review,2,,10.1108/JCP-05-2021-0017,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Journal of Criminal Psychology,2021.0,30.0,0.0,,509,113138431,Danielle Nicholson,48263975,C.

Twenty-first-century scholarship continues to refine and, in some cases, supplant long-held axioms about gang formation, organization, and behavior. Recent advances can be traced to shifts in the empirical social reality and conditions within which gangs exist and act. We draw out this relationship mdash between the ontological and epistemological mdash by identifying key macrostructural shifts that have transformed gang composition and behavior and, in turn, forced scholars to revise dominant theoretical frameworks and analytical approaches. These shifts include large-scale economic transformations, the expansion of punitive state interventions, the proliferation of the Internet and social media, intensified globalization, and the increasing presence of women and LGBTQ individuals in gangs and gang research.

It seeks to provide a better understanding of the reception and the influences of such strategies, through a mediatized form of human and social interactions and a triangulated mixed-method (focus group and “before-after” attitudes measurement protocol). The results show that, in reception: (1) violence is perceived in its collective dimension; education is the more important way to counter this social problem, while notably the law and contemporary feminism represent resistances to change. Characters and violence based in reality constitute specific cues of GDS. (2) Furthermore, the GDS generate a psychological discomfort but a little virtual empathy.

Therefore, in this article, we analyse the circumstances that promote the search for religious spiritual assistance and how this corresponds to the expectations of victims of violence in the workplace. Based on the results of the empirical study, we demonstrate that despite secularization trends, a sufficient value-based foundation still remains, which makes assistance provided by religious organizations potentially acceptable to victims. Contrary to what could have been expected, men reported being victims of violence more often, and the differences between individual age groups were statistically insignificant. The age variable was important only for obtaining information on this type of assistance. Women, meanwhile, emphasized the importance of religious values more than men did, but at the same time, they also showed greater sensitivity to the contextual circumstances on which the decision to seek religious assistance depended.

515,"© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This article explores the theoretical and practical role(s) of humour in facilitating outreach about sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in Sierra Leone. While humour might be considered an insensitive way of approaching difficult issues, this project shows that incongruity can in fact be productive. Recognizing that humour itself can be a form of symbolic or physical violence in some contexts, we argue that humour is a means of opening up conversations about violence (in this case SGBV) in order to address the social and legal challenges associated with it. Our pilot project–devised by an interdisciplinary team and conducted in partnership with a Sierra Leonean access-to-justice NGO, Timap for Justice–used comedy and performance to meet two key challenges: to disseminate awareness about social and legal issues related to commonplace practices of SGBV, and to open up a broader discussion about experiences of SGBV. Using empirical evidence from focus groups and interviews, this article shows how a humorous approach proved to be a productive mode of engagement and examines key concepts including ‘the vicinity of laughter’ (involving the spatial and interpersonal aspects of humour), the connections between laughter and memory, and the paradoxical relationship between lived experience, humour and violence.",2021-01-01,Journal,Article,Critical African Studies,21100426136,2,13,"Bringing inside out: humour, outreach, and sexual and gender-based violence in Sierra Leone Faire ressortir l’intérieur: Humour, sensibilisation, et violence sexuelle et sexiste en Sierra Leone",1,true,10.1080/21681392.2021.2005378,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Critical African Studies,2021.0,59.0,0.0,,515,145741734,Laura S.

517,"© 2021 American Psychological AssociationAlthough hostile expressions of masculinity have robust negative impacts in multiple domains among civilian populations, in the military, masculinity is a rarer target of inquiry and remains a polarizing subject. This article examines hostile and hypermasculine attitudes that prior work suggests may be associated with negative consequences for the social environment and men themselves in a U.S. military educational environment (N = 1,560 freshmen and 499 graduating senior men). Multivariate moderated multiple regressions (MMMR) linked military hypermasculinity facets (Machiavellian desire for status and control; conformity to masculine norms including emotional control, violence tolerance, needing to win, and impersonal sex preference; hostile and benevolent sexism) to performance outcomes including academics, leadership, and fitness; perceptions of peers, leadership, and antibias programming; and behavior. Desire for status, impersonal sex preference, violence tolerance, and benevolent sexism predicted negative performance outcomes. Violence tolerance, emotional control, and hostile sexism were associated with poorer perception of character education and/or anti-bias programming. Needing to win and control were associated with positive performance outcomes.

519,"© 2021 AOSIS (pty) Ltd. All rights reserved.We support an affirming approach to managing the transgender and gender diverse (TGD) client, centering on the individual’s agency, autonomy and right to selfdetermination, as opposed to practices that pathologise and stigmatise transgender identity, imposing barriers to accessing healthcare services. Transgender and gender diverse individuals have long faced discrimination on multiple axes, both globally and in South Africa. Although South Africa enshrines the protection of human rights in its Constitution, TGD individuals continue to face marginalisation, prejudice and threats to their safety. Challenges, including homelessness, unemployment, poor social support, bullying, harassment and violence, persist, indicating failures of policy development, practice implementation and a disregard for the human rights of individuals in the TGD community. This guideline has been developed primarily with the intention of centering and amplifying voices of TGD individuals in order to facilitate access to healthare that is sensitive, skilled and respectful. We recognise that there are significant gaps in the knowledge and skills of healthcare providers, and there is a lack of understanding of the unique experiences faced by TGD persons. The prevailing sentiment that many healthcare providers hold around TGD individuals, informed by ignorance and conditioning within social and societal structures, are malevolent towards this community, and often include harmful assumptions and generalisations. We believe that healthcare providers have an ethical obligation to interrogate these notions, and we promote an attitude of respect for diversity that upholds human rights. It has been well established that access to competent and dignified gender-affirming healthcare (GAHC) is not only safe but also plays a significant role in improving measurable outcomes for TGD clients. It has also been well established that pathologising approaches and practices that limit access to care can be damaging and harmful. Finally, we recognise that TGD individuals have historically endured being undermined, condescended to and pitied by the healthcare system and its providers. We affirm a commitment to upholding a strength-based perspective that values and respects the experiences of TGD clients and celebrates their individual identity rather than merely accepting or tolerating it. This guideline, which no doubt will require ongoing revision, reflection and refinement in consultation with TGD communities and healthcare providers, represents a first step made in good faith towards creating a practical tool founded in robust scientific evidence, lodged within a human rights framework, and is intended to facilitate access to skilled and sensitive care that will yield tangible benefits to this unique and important group.",2021-01-01,Journal,Review,Southern African Journal of HIV Medicine,93433,4,22,Southern African HIV Clinicians Society gender-affirming healthcare guideline for South Africa,1,true,10.4102/sajhivmed.v22i1.1299,AOSIS (pty) Ltd,,,,,,519,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,12.0,2.0,11.0,128.0,6.0,10.0,136.0,6.0,25.0,54.0,4.0,9.0,69.0,4.0,8.0,171.0,5.0,

While there has been a great deal of feminist work dedicated to analysing the social, cultural, political, and institutional effects of misogyny, the ancillary theories of misogyny these analyses produce are only ever partial, fragmented, vague or conceptually inconsistent. This article engages and critiques these theories by focusing on three separate but related issues within existing feminist scholarship on misogyny: the conflation of misogyny with sexism, the elision of misogyny's affective elements and the supplanting of misogyny with gendered violence. Through my identification and critique of these issues, I argue that misogyny should be understood as a profoundly complicated and emotional social dynamic. Moreover, I argue that to attempt to cleanse misogyny of its affective/emotional complexity or conflate misogyny with sexism and/or violence is to rob theorists of possible loci of apprehension and intervention. My hope is that this article will stimulate feminist theorists to work collectively towards a more comprehensive feminist understanding of misogyny – one that grapples with the interpersonal and affective complexities of how misogyny emerges, circulates and self-perpetuates.",2021-01-01,Journal,Article,Feminist Theory,700147308,2,,Feminist theory and the problem of misogyny,0,false,10.1177/14647001211039365,SAGE Publications Ltd,Feminist Theory,2021.0,8.0,0.0,,520,148164648,S.

521,"© 2021 Masaryk University. All rights reserved.This research explores the reasons that lead survivors of sexual and gender-based violence to share their experiences on Twitter, as well as the reasons that prevent them from doing so. Using an online survey, we investigated the perspective of 94 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Open-ended responses were analysed with the ALCESTE method, a lexical analysis. Considering that in-person self-disclosure differs from in-public self-disclosure, we based our interpretations of the findings on self-disclosure as well as collective action and social activism frameworks. Results showed that those who shared their experience on Twitter did so to render sexual and gender-based violence more visible, and to support the #MeToo movement. They also wanted to change public perceptions of sexual and gender-based violence, while addressing violence at work and denouncing rape culture (the difficulty of filing a complaint, and victim blaming). On the contrary, survivors who did not tweet their experience expressed several concerns, such as feeling ashamed, the fear of being judged by others, and a lack of trust in the Twitter platform and its members. This research concludes that in order to understand the disclosure of victimisation on social network sites, like Twitter, it is worthwhile to complement the self-disclosure framework with insights on collective action and social activism. We also make a call for taking into account differences of social network sites when studying online disclosure of sexual and gender-based violence.

523,"© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Gender-based online violence (GBOV) involves digitally-mediated and -enabled forms of harassment and abuse targeting women, and thus represents a major challenge to feminist movements globally. In this paper, we argue that civil society-based feminist organizations from various parts of the world have responded to this challenge by centring evidence of GBOV in order to develop key though hitherto under-examined epistemic, cultural, and socio-political practices, which we term evidentiary activism. Using a qualitative content analysis of 82 documents produced by feminist organizations, our analysis finds that this activism has two fundamental components. First, feminist organizations engage with existing formal evidentiary cultures by advancing and critiquing legislative and regulatory reforms to address GBOV, platform-based technological ‘solutions,’ and conventional notions of user privacy and anonymity. Second, they embrace and contribute to informal evidentiary cultures, which treat evidence as a tool of cultural and political mobilization against GBOV through strategies of publicization, moral pollution, and the cultivation of feminist digital citizenship. We contend that, akin to evidence-based advocacy that is influential in the fields of biomedicine and health, feminist organizations participate in and invent modes of digitally-oriented evidentiary activism designed to combat GBOV.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Homicide presents a significant health burden globally, but geographical differences in homicide rates necessitate focussed analyses of spatial and temporal patterns, particularly in affected areas. The highest rates are concentrated in regions in Central and South America, but analyses of sub-regional patterns and sex-specific differences may yield important information for addressing the upstream causes of homicide at the community level. Objective: This study examines and presents spatial and temporal patterns of homicide victims from 2006 to 2015 in the state of Alagoas, Brazil, focussing on the municipality scale and differentiated by victims’ sex. Methods: Data comprising victims’ age, sex, the date, time, and the municipality of the homicide incident were acquired from the Brazilian National Mortality Information System. These data were aggregated by municipality, and we made quantitative comparisons of sex-specific homicide rates between the capital city of Macieó metropolitan region and the peripheral, predominantly rural regions. Empirical Local Bayes methods were used to adjust per-capita homicide risk estimates and map the results. Results: A total of 19,560 homicides occurred during the study period, with an average of 60.4 per 100,000 inhabitants; the metropolitan region rate was 81.8, compared to 46.5 for the remaining regions. The male homicide rate was 115.9 per 100,000, compared to 7.1 for females. Empirical Local Bayes mapping showed strong clustering of male homicide risk in specific cities near the capital, while female risk was more dispersed throughout the region. Conclusions: The risk of male victim homicide observed for the metropolitan region of Alagoas was amongst the highest globally, particularly during the period 2012–2014.

531,"© 2021, The Author(s).Purpose: Experiences of reported trauma are common and are associated with a range of mental health problems. Sex differences in how reported traumas are experienced over the life course in relation to mental health require further exploration. Methods: 157,358 participants contributed data for the UK Biobank Mental Health Questionnaire (MHQ). Stratified Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to analyse combinations of reported traumatic experiences in males and females separately, and associations with mental health. Results: In females, five trauma classes were identified: a low-risk class (58.6%), a childhood trauma class (13.5%), an intimate partner violence class (12.9%), a sexual violence class (9.1%), and a high-risk class (5.9%). In males, a three-class solution was preferred: a low-risk class (72.6%), a physical and emotional trauma class (21.9%), and a sexual violence class (5.5%). In comparison to the low-risk class in each sex, all trauma classes were associated with increased odds of current depression, anxiety, and hazardous/harmful alcohol use after adjustment for covariates. The high-risk class in females and the sexual violence class in males produced significantly increased odds for recent psychotic experiences.

534,"© The Author(s) 2021.Background: RBMS3 (RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-intervacting protein 3) acts as a tumor-suppressive gene in a number of human cancers, however, its role in breast cancer is not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinicopathological significance of RBMS3 in breast cancer. Methods: A total of 998 breast cancer tissue samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database with survival outcomes were divided into high RBMS3 expression and low expression groups using the median as the cutoff. Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were compared between the 2 groups. Results: TCGA showed that RBMS3 mRNA was downregulated in breast cancer tissues, and RBMS3 downregulation was correlated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry staining of 127 paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues showed that RBMS3 protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus; however, nuclear staining was present in 90.0% of normal breast tissues but only 28.3% of breast cancer tissues. Decreased RBMS3 protein expression was significantly correlated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative status and death at final follow-up. Patients with lower RBMS3 protein expression had substantially shorter survival than those with higher RBMS3 expression. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that the combination of RBMS3 expression and ER status (a variable designated as “cofactor”) was an independent prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.420, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.223-0.791, P = 0.007).

Our starting point is that questions about violence in education are inextricably bound to gender and sexuality, and no engagement with violence can exclude it. The chapter provides a strong basis for understanding the key themes in the book, articulated through a “three-ply yarn approach.” This approach rejects pathologising the violent behaviour of individuals and instead draws attention to gender, sexuality, and the cultural dimensions of violence as it is experienced in educational spaces in South Africa. Through the triple-ply approach the chapter provides a context for understanding masculinities, heterosexuality, gender, race, culture, poverty, class, and structural inequalities. It introduces the key themes in the chapters that comprise the book and argues that changes to dominant ideologies around gender and sexuality are required, as is the need to focus on poverty, culture, race, and class inequalities in order to address gender violence in educational spaces in the country.",2021-01-01,Book Series,Book Chapter,Palgrave Studies in Gender and Education,21100903771,2,,"Introduction: Gender, sexuality, and violence in education—a three-ply yarn approach",0,false,10.1007/978-3-030-69988-8_1,Palgrave Macmillan,,2021.0,88.0,0.0,,535,47711986,Deevia Bhana,79709364,Shakila Singh,108514659,Thabo Msibi,,,,,,,193.0,2918.0,32.0,23.0,99.0,7.0,38.0,726.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,Sociology

The authors identified the problems of effective participation of Ukrainian human rights NGOs in the field of gender equality provision and suggested the ways to tackle them. The purpose of the article is to define the nature and the rate of engagement of non-governmental human rights organizations in the issue of provision of gender equality in Ukraine. Materials and methods: The investigation was based on the theoretical methods that cover the content analysis of statutory documents and reports of non-governmental human rights organizations that carry out activities on provision of gender equality in Ukraine. The empirical methods are related to the processing of statistical data on the amount of legal services provided and human rights-related activities of non-governmental human rights organizations in the field of promotion of female rights in Ukraine. Discussion and Conclusion: Human rights NGOs play a fundamental role in the provision of gender equality in Ukraine. Human rights NGOs in the field of gender equality provision founded in Ukraine are of international, national, and local levels. Most human rights NGOs in the field of gender equality provision are concentrated in large regions of Ukraine. Ways of increasing the amount of gender-related human rights NGOs are suggested. Human rights NGOs in Ukraine carry out educational, advocacy, consulting, monitoring, and research activities. The most common activity carried out by Ukrainian human rights NGOs is educational. Few Ukrainian human rights NGOs publish reports on the results of their activities, which demonstrates the low level of transparency of such organizations’ activities. Due to weak connection of human rights NGOs with governmental human rights and research institutions, there is a low number of gender-related monitoring and scientific projects within the activity of human rights NGO.

537,"© 2021. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.The notion woman were created ‘inferior’ and its interplay with the negative cultural perceptions of women by Christian men arguably act as an accessory to gender-based violence (GBV) in the church. Hence, there is a need for the church to rethinks and continually discerns the implications of the creation of man and woman in Genesis 1:26–27 and 2:18. The following question arise: Does the creation of man and woman in Genesis assume women inferiority? What is the interplay between the notion ‘she was created inferior’ and negative cultural perceptions of women? How could the church interrogate this interplay to improve gender relations within church and local cultural contexts? This article utilises a public pastoral care approach as a theoretical lens that the church could employ to address women inferiority as a form of GBV. Firstly, the article examines the interplay between ‘she was created inferior’ and negative cultural gender relations in church that fan GBV. Secondly, it assesses Genesis 1:26–27; 2:18 and 3:1–6 in the context of man and woman creation to discern God’s ideal plan for gender relations. Thirdly, the article establishes how a positive conception of Genesis 1 and 2 could transform certain cultural understandings of women that fan GBV in church. Fourthly, the article proposes public pastoral care roles for the church to mitigate the perception of women inferiority as GBV in church and community. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: The article considers sociocultural factors that cause GBV and evaluates the phenomenon from a theological perspective to develop GBV ecclesiological interventions. Thus, it considers GBV from a socio-theological and biblical framework.

539,"© The Author(s) 2020.Intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) is the most pervasive violation of women’s rights worldwide, causing devastating lifelong damage. Victims can suffer physical, emotional or mental health problems, and experience detrimental effects in social, psychological and relational health with their families, especially children. Due to the complexity regarding violence against women in heterosexual couples, it is important to make a clear distinction between psychological and physical mistreatment, which also includes psychological violence. This differentiation is important in determining different emotional and psychological aspects of mistreatment in order to understand the reasons why some women stay in such relationships and to explain the personality profiles of victims and perpetrators. In this short narrative review, we have combined perspectives of depth psychology and attachment theory from studies on trauma, traumatic bonds and the perpetrator/victim complex in gender violence. We have also considered the growing literature on IPVAW as it relates to the medico-legal field. Our search strategy included intimate partner violence, attachment styles, risk factors and the victim/perpetrator relationship.

We suggest that women’s social inequality contributes to both roles of women as victims and as perpetrators of terrorist violence, with both roles ultimately contributing to increases in supplies of domestic terrorism. Particularly, women’s social inequality contributes to terrorism in three ways: it normalizes violence in society, makes women susceptible to coercion from terrorist groups, and results in grievances in the female population that may mobilize them to violence. An in-depth case study of women in Somalia and the quantitative results both suggest that women’s political, economic, and social inequality are associated with higher levels of domestic terrorism.

Kidney diseases are particularly challenging to tackle because they are pathologically diverse and are often asymptomatic. As such, kidney disease is often diagnosed late, and the global burden of kidney disease continues to be underappreciated. When kidney disease is not detected and treated early, patient care requires specialized resources that drive up cost, place many people at risk of catastrophic health expenditure and pose high opportunity costs for health systems. Prevention of kidney disease is highly cost-effective but requires a multisectoral holistic approach. Each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) has the potential to impact kidney disease risk or improve early diagnosis and treatment, and thus reduce the need for high-cost care. All countries have agreed to strive to achieve the SDGs, but progress is disjointed and uneven among and within countries.

546,"© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Most research on sexual abuse examines the role of men in the perpetration of abuse against women and children. Few studies have explored victims’ accounts of Female-perpetrated Sexual Abuse (FSA), and even fewer have focused on male FSA victims. However, the limited research available demonstrates that there are particular conditions that make it possible for men to identify as FSA victims. This is the first study of its kind that explores the possibilities for such self-identification by investigating how male victims negotiate masculinity and victimhood in the context of FSA in the Global South. As part of a larger study on FSA, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five culturally diverse South African men who self-identified as experiencing sexual abuse as children or adolescents by women, and analysed the data using a critical discourse analysis. We demonstrate precisely how contemporary constructions of gender and sexuality both produce and constrain possibilities for men who report childhood or adolescent FSA to identify as victims. These constructions are anchored in accounts that emphasise hierarchies of vulnerability, body betrayal, emasculation, preconceptions of ‘normal’ sexuality, the eroticisation of the female offender and ‘triumphant’ variants of masculinity. Such accounts present just how male victimhood becomes possible to ‘detect’ and challenge contemporary constructions of sexual violence, in turn suggesting new possibilities for understanding the conditions under which normative gender roles implicated in violence are sustained or disrupted.",2021-01-01,Journal,Article,"Gender, Place and Culture",23638,1,28,The making of male victimhood in South African Female-perpetrated Sexual Abuse,0,false,10.1080/0966369X.2020.1835831,Routledge,,2020.0,85.0,0.0,,546,40422745,Sherianne Kramer,145741018,B.

547,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdPurpose: Psychopathy is a multifaceted disorder of personality that gives rise to distinct profiles of scores across the interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and antisocial features of the disorder. The identification of distinct profiles of psychopathic traits is of practical importance as they help to distinguish between patients with distinct areas of risk and need. Methods: We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of psychopathic traits in female (N = 357) and male (N = 483) civil psychiatric patients. Results: Three latent profiles were identified that appeared similar in women and in men. These profiles were termed Callous Aggressive, Antisocial, and Low psychopathic traits. A fourth profile identified in men was termed Moderate psychopathic traits. These profiles were distinguishable in terms of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, thoughts and attempts at self-harm, violence, and normal range personality traits. Extending current knowledge, we showed that equivalent profiles in women and in men were nonetheless distinguishable in terms of their associated psychological characteristics. Conclusions: Our results suggest that areas of risk and need vary between profiles of psychopathic traits, and that interventions should incorporate gender-specific features that account for between-gender variation.",2021-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Criminal Justice,25733,2,72,Variants of psychopathy in male and female civil psychiatric patients: Latent profile analyses of the MacArthur violence risk dataset,0,false,10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2020.101748,Elsevier Ltd,,2020.0,58.0,0.0,,547,3995705,Steven M.

548,"© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Introduction: Large socioeconomic, gender, and ethnic inequalities exist in terms of childhood obesity worldwide. Children from low socioeconomic status families are more likely to have overweight/obesity and related cardiometabolic problems and future cancer risk. A wider concept are social vulnerabilities defined as social or economic characteristics or experiences negatively affecting children through behavioral, biological factors, or mental health. Social vulnerabilities include also therefore low subjective perceptions of social position. Objective: This study aims to identify social vulnerabilities and to summarize their impact as obesity development risk factor. Preventive programs implemented targeting these vulnerable groups and their effectiveness are also discussed. Methods: Literature review based on the experience of the authors social vulnerabilities identified as risk factors for childhood obesity were children whose parents lack of a social network, low support from formal and informal sources, parental unemployment, belonging to a minority group or having migrant background, adverse childhood experiences including household dysfunction, violence and childhood maltreatment and other traumatic experiences, gender inequalities and being part of nontraditional families. Results: The impact of social vulnerabilities on childhood obesity is independent of SES; however, SES exacerbates or buffer the effect social vulnerabilities have on different lifestyles and stress. Behavioral, biological, and mental health mechanisms may explain the association between social vulnerabilities and childhood obesity. Conclusions: Behaviors such as dietary intake, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep are negatively affected by the stress and low levels of mental health derived from social vulnerabilities. It seems that high energy intakes rather than low physical activity levels might be the main driving force behind the obesity epidemic in vulnerable groups. Most of the prevention programs identified did not take into account social vulnerabilities and inequalities making them ineffective in most vulnerable groups.

553,"© 2020 American Psychological AssociationThe Twitter hashtag #Gillette emerged in 2019 as a reaction to an advertisement that called attention to unhealthy manifestations of masculinities among men. The advertisement also encouraged men to intervene when they witnessed violence by and among other men. The “precarious manhood” thesis posits that pressure to constantly “prove” one's masculinity provokes deep anxiety among men and that some men may resort to extreme, potentially risky externalizing behaviors—such as aggression—to project the traditional masculine norm of dominance when they perceive their masculine status is challenged. Gender transformative public health policies and programs also invoke resistance from some men. From this framework, the present study used qualitative thematic coding of a sample of original-content tweets (N = 497) to examine public sentiment toward an advertisement that directly challenged masculine norms of dominance and aggression. Themes included (a) commentary on the company that used the advertisement, (b) descriptions of masculine norms, (c) engaging men in challenging hypermasculine norms, and (d) resistance to the advertisement through deflection and antifeminist sentiment. A fifth theme encompassed comments that reflected nationalism, racial animus, and commentary on the political affiliations of other Twitter users. These findings highlight the opportunity for advertisements to initiate widespread discussion of masculine norms on social media, as well as the potential for discussions that question traditional masculine norms to incite defensiveness among some individuals.

561,"© 2021 SAGE Publications.Dating violence presents a serious threat for individual health and well-being. A growing body of literature suggests that starting in adolescence, individuals with sexual minority identities (e.g., individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual) may be at an increased risk for dating violence compared with heterosexuals. Research has not, however, identified the mechanisms that explain this vulnerability. Using a diverse sample of young adults (n = 2,474), the current study explored how minority stress theory, revictimization theory, sex of sexual partners, and risky sexual behavior explained differences in dating violence between sexual minority and heterosexual young adults. Initial analyses suggested higher rates of dating violence among individuals who identified as bisexual, and individuals who identified as gay or lesbian when compared with heterosexuals, and further found that these associations failed to differ across gender. When mediating and control variables were included in the analyses, however, the association between both sexual minority identities and higher levels of dating violence became nonsignificant. Of particular interest was the role of discrimination, which mediated the association between bisexual identity and dating violence. Other factors, including sex and number of sexual partners, alcohol use, and childhood maltreatment, were associated with higher rates of dating violence but did not significantly explain vulnerability among sexual minority individuals compared with their heterosexual peers. These findings suggest the importance of minority stress theory in explaining vulnerability to dating violence victimization among bisexuals in particular, and generally support the importance of sexual-minority specific variables in understanding risk for dating violence within this vulnerable population.",2021-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,29,36,Mediating Factors Explaining the Association Between Sexual Minority Status and Dating Violence,0,false,10.1177/0886260517726971,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2017.0,67.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The importance of minority stress theory in explaining vulnerability to dating violence victimization among bisexuals in particular is suggested, and the importance of sexual-minority specific variables in understanding risk for dating violence within this vulnerable population is generally supported.'}",561,1398755533,A.

562,"© 2021 SAGE Publications.The occurrence of aggressive behavior in intimate relationships carries serious mental and physical health consequences for the victims and children exposed to such events. Studies have been devoted toward understanding the nature and prevalence of the phenomenon; however, there has been a paucity of empirical investigation into the complexities and nuances of the subject matter, and this study seeks to address one of such complexities. This study examines the dynamics of intimate partner violence (IPV) within the context of perpetration and victimization among residents in Bariga Local Community Development Area in Lagos State, Nigeria. Using a cross-sectional survey, 218 married residents of the area were analyzed through bivariate and multivariate regression analysis.

563,"© 2020 Author(s). Published by BMJ.Background Between 2015 and 2018, three civil society organisations in Rwanda implemented Indashyikirwa, a four-part intervention designed to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV) among couples and within communities. We assessed the impact of the programme's gender transformative curriculum for couples. Methods Sectors (n=28) were purposively selected based on density of village savings and loan association (VLSA) groups and randomised (with stratification by district) to either the full community-level Indashyikirwa programme (n=14) or VSLA-only control (n=14). Within each sector, 60 couples recruited from VSLAs received either a 21-session curriculum or VSLA as usual. No blinding was attempted. Primary outcomes were perpetration (for men) or experience (for women) of past-year physical/sexual IPV at 24 months post-baseline, hypothesised to be reduced in intervention versus control (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03477877). Results We enrolled 828 women and 821 men in the intervention sectors and 832 women and 830 men in the control sectors; at endline, 815 women (98.4%) and 763 men (92.9%) in the intervention and 802 women (96.4%) and 773 men (93.1%) were available for intention-to-treat analysis. Women in the intervention compared with control were less likely to report physical and/or sexual IPV at 24 months (adjusted relative risk (aRR)=0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.59). Men in the intervention compared with control were also significantly less likely to report perpetration of physical and/or sexual IPV at 24 months (aRR=0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.75). Additional intervention benefits included reductions in acceptability of wife beating, conflict with partner, depression, and corporal punishment against children and improved conflict management, communication, trust, self-efficacy, self-rated health, household earnings, food security and actions to prevent IPV. There were no study-related harms. Conclusions The Indashyikirwa couples' training curriculum was highly effective in reducing IPV among male/female couples in rural Rwanda.

However, we have little knowledge about the extent to which gun homicides within adolescents' neighborhoods affect their mental health and behavioral outcomes. This is important because local gun homicide incidents may be uniquely harmful for adolescents and their association with adolescents' mental health and behavior may represent an underappreciated externality of the U.S.‘s gun violence epidemic. In this study, we used data on the geocoded location of gun homicides linked with restricted Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study data to examine whether gun homicides incidents near adolescents' homes and/or schools were associated with their mental health and behavioral outcomes.

566,"Copyright © 2020 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of individuals each year and is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. TBI is heterogeneous and outcome is influenced by a combination of factors that include injury location, severity, genetics, and environmental factors. More recently, sex as a biological variable has been incorporated into TBI research, although there is conflicting literature regarding clinical outcomes in males versus females after TBI. We review the current clinical literature investigating sex differences after TBI. We focus our discussion on differences within contemporary gender categories to suggest that binary categories of male and female are not sufficient to guide clinical decisions for neurotrauma. Some studies have considered physiological variables that influence sex such as hormone cycles and stages in males and females pre- and post-TBI. These data suggest that there are phasic differences within male populations and within female populations that influence an individual's outcome after TBI. Finally, we discuss the impact of gender identity and expression on outcome after TBI and highlight the lack of neurotrauma research that includes non-binary individuals. Social constructs regarding gender impact an individual's vulnerability to violence and consequent TBI, including the successful reintegration to society after TBI.

While some pandemic-related stressors affect nearly everyone, many especially affect women. Purpose: To review what is known about the pandemic’s effect on women’s mental health, what makes them more predisposed to vulnerabilities and adverse impacts, and strategies for preventing and treating these mental health consequences in the female population during specific stages across the lifespan. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review in combination with their observations from clinical experience in the field of women’s mental health and reproductive psychiatry. Articles on women’s mental health and COVID-19 up to May 30, 2020, were searched using the electronic PubMed and PsychInfo databases, as well as publications by major health entities (e.g., World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations) and press releases from prime communication outlets (e.g., National Public Radio). Results and conclusions: Women who are pregnant, postpartum, miscarrying, or experiencing intimate partner violence are at especially high risk for developing mental health problems during the pandemic. Proactive outreach to these groups of women and enhancement of social supports could lead to prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment. Social support is a key protective factor.

568,"© 2020, The Author(s).Background: Gender-based violence among young women is a growing problem worldwide. The consequences of this victimization have been well reported in the scientific literature, among which negative health outcomes stand out. The factors influencing this problem are many; one highlighted by research is socialization into a dominant coercive discourse that associates sexual-affective attraction to males with violent attitudes and behaviors, while in turn, such discourse empties males with egalitarian behaviors from sexual attractiveness. This coercive discourse may be shaping the sexual preferences of female youth. The current paper explores young women’s preferences for different types of sexual relationships and, more particularly, for what type of sexual affective relationships they coercively preferred men with violent attitudes and behavior. Methods: A quantitative, mixed-design vignette study was conducted with 191 college females in Spain. We focused the analysis only on responses about vignettes including narratives of men with violent attitudes and behaviors. In addition, we examined whether participants would report higher coerced preferences for violent men when asked about the coerced preferences of their female friends than when asked about their own preferences. Results: Only 28.95% of participants responded that their female friends would prefer a young man with violent behavior for a stable relationship, meanwhile 58.42% would do it for hooking up. When reporting about themselves, the difference was greater: 28.42% would prefer a young man with violent behavior for hooking up and just 5.78% for a stable relationship. Conclusions: The dominant coercive discourse that links attractiveness to people with violent attitudes and behaviors may be explaining the results obtained in this study. The findings can help eliminate the stereotype largely adopted by some intervention and prevention programs which assume that gender-based violence occurs mainly in stable relationships, considering that falling in love is the reason that lead women to suffer from violence. Our results can also support health professionals and others serving young women to enhance their identification of gender violence victimization, as well as our findings point to the need to include the evidence of gender violence in sporadic relationships in prevention programs and campaigns addressed to young women.",2020-12-01,Journal,Article,BMC Women's Health,19499,7,20,Female university students’ preferences for different types of sexual relationships: implications for gender-based violence prevention programs and policies,1,true,10.1186/s12905-020-01131-1,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Women's Health,2020.0,120.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings can help eliminate the stereotype largely adopted by some intervention and prevention programs which assume that gender-based violence occurs mainly in stable relationships, considering that falling in love is the reason that lead women to suffer from violence.'}",568,1417184545,Laura Ruiz-Eugenio,1405218880,Sandra Racionero-Plaza,35115070,Elena Duque,7140125,Lídia Puigvert,,,,,18.0,152.0,5.0,25.0,111.0,6.0,26.0,251.0,8.0,56.0,1055.0,18.0,,,,,,,Medicine

Yet, the timing and nature of gender inequalities during childhood and adolescence are less clear. We describe the emergence of gender inequalities in health and wellbeing across the first two decades of life. Methods: We focused on the 40 low-income and middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific. A measurement framework was developed around four key domains of wellbeing across the first two decades: health, education and transition to employment, protection, and a safe environment. Specific measurement constructs were then defined by considering gender indicator frameworks, the Sustainable Development Goals, indicator frameworks for child and adolescent health and wellbeing, and key stakeholder input. Available data were then mapped to define 87 indicators, subsequently populated using databases (UN agencies and the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study) and nationally representative surveys. Where possible, estimates in girls were compared with boys to report relative risks. Findings: Although son preference is evident in some settings—as shown by higher than expected male-to-female sex ratios at birth in India, Vietnam, and China (all >1·10 compared with an expected ratio of 1·05) and excess mortality of girl children in some South Asian and Pacific nations—it is during early adolescence where marked gender inequalities consistently emerged. Adolescent girls face considerable disadvantage in relation to sexual and reproductive health (notably in South Asia and the Pacific), with high rates of child marriage (≥30% of women aged 20–24 years married before 18 years in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Afghanistan), fertility (≥65 livebirths per 1000 girls in Nauru, Laos, Afghanistan, Nepal, Marshall Islands, Bangladesh, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea), and intimate partner violence (>20% in Timor Leste, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar). Despite educational parity in many countries, females aged 15–24 years were less likely than males to be in education, employment, or training in 17 of 19 countries for which data were available. Compared with girls, adolescent boys experienced excess all-cause mortality and substantially higher mortality due to unintentional injury, interpersonal violence, alcohol and other drugs, and suicide, and higher prevalence of harmful drinking and tobacco smoking. Interpretation: These findings call for a focus on gender policy and programming in later childhood and early adolescence before gender inequalities become embedded.

570,"© 2020, The Author(s).Background: There are an estimated 3.2 million women who inject drugs worldwide, constituting 20% of all people who inject drugs. The limited data that are available suggest that women who inject drugs are at greater risk of HIV and viral hepatitis acquisition than men who inject drugs. This increased vulnerability is a product of a range of environmental, social and individual factors affecting women, which also affect their ability to engage in health promoting services such as harm reduction. Methods: The researchers undertook a narrative literature review examining access to harm reduction services for women who use drugs in Europe and conducted semi-structured focus groups with women who use drugs and harm reduction and prison health workers in Barcelona, Spain. Results: Women who use drugs face multiple barriers to accessing harm reduction services. These include stigma, both in society in general and from health and harm reduction workers in prisons and in the community; gender-based violence and a lack of services that are equipped to address the interaction between drug use and experiences of violence; criminalisation in the form of legal barriers to access, arrest and harassment from law enforcement, and incarceration; and a lack of services focused on the specific needs of women, notably sexual and reproductive health services and childcare. In Barcelona, participants reported experiencing all these barriers, and that their engagement with the Metzineres harm reduction centre had to some extent mitigated them. However, women continued to experience structural barriers to harm reduction service access. Conclusions: Women and gender non-conforming people who use drugs face unique barriers to accessing harm reduction services. While services such as Metzineres can be life changing and life affirming for its members, it is incumbent on states to act to address the structural barriers to health faced by women who use drugs.",2020-12-01,Journal,Article,Harm Reduction Journal,20814,22,17,"Women and barriers to harm reduction services: a literature review and initial findings from a qualitative study in Barcelona, Spain",1,true,10.1186/s12954-020-00429-5,BioMed Central Ltd,Harm Reduction Journal,2020.0,113.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Women and gender non-conforming people who use drugs face unique barriers to accessing harm reduction services, and it is incumbent on states to act to address the structural barriers to health faced by women who usedrugs.'}",570,1435533937,S.

571,"© 2020, The Author(s).There is rising attention in Italy and Europe to the occurrence, consequences, and factors related to sexual violence. The focus on women as the primary victims of sexual violence has, however, left data collection and research on young men and sexual minorities in the background. Moreover, young people’s experiences of sexual abuse in the context of their relationships with peers are hardly recognised as a policy concern. The ultimate aim of this paper is to disentangle intersectionalities between gender, migration background, sexual orientation, and sexual experience in shaping the risk of experiencing sexual violence among university students in Italy. We use data from the Sexual and Emotional LiFe of Youths (SELFY) survey carried out in Italy in 2017. Our data confirm that women and foreign-born students are at higher risk of sexual violence. Our data also support previous evidence that bisexual women are at a higher risk of sexual violence victimisation compared with peer students with other sexual orientations. Previous same-sex sexual experience is more relevant than sexual orientation in shaping the risk. The effect is gendered: the risk of sexual violence is lower for women with previous same-sex sexual experience compared with their male peers.

Method: Data were based on self-reports from 14,765 students who responded to the 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Confirmatory latent class analysis (LCA) identified two distinct, dichotomous latent class variables manifested by indicators of past-year NFSB (i.e., ideation, plan, and attempt) and aggressive behavior (i.e., physical fighting in general and on school property). The structural model estimated the odds ratios between NFSB, aggressive behavior, and their potential risk factors. Results: Without adjusting for covariates, the confirmatory LCA estimated an odds ratio (OR) of 2.55 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.93, 3.37) between two latent class variables for violence against self (NFSB) and others (physical fighting). The net association, however, was rendered nonsignificant (OR = 1.08 [95% CI: 0.88, 1.31]) when adjusted for covariates. Significant common risk factors included exposure to physical dating violence, being bullied on school property and/or electronically, being threatened or injured by someone with a weapon on school property, and lifetime illegal drug use and prescription opioid misuse.

Results showed that females scored significantly higher on vulnerable narcissism than males, but no gender differences were found for grandiose narcissism. In males, vulnerable narcissism was a significant positive predictor of physical/sexual abuse perpetration, and grandiose narcissism was a significant positive predictor of psychological abuse. For females, only vulnerable narcissism emerged as a significant positive predictor of physical/sexual and psychological abuse perpetration.

574,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdBackground: The South African national HIV plan recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for transgender women, whose HIV prevalence estimates are as high as 25% in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to explore PrEP awareness, uptake, and willingness, as well as associated barriers and facilitators, in order to inform PrEP implementation efforts with transgender women in South Africa. Methods: Using a community-engaged, convergent parallel mixed methods design, trained local transgender women data collectors recruited 213 transgender women participants (aged >18 years, assigned male sex at birth, and identifying as a gender different from male), via network referral and word-of-mouth in Cape Town, East London, and Johannesburg. A subset of 36 transgender women also participated in qualitative in-depth interviews. Quantitative analyses included descriptive statistics and negative binomial regression models to assess correlates of PrEP willingness. Qualitative interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded. Thematic content analysis was used to identify key themes. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated for interpretation. Findings: Participants were recruited between June 1 and Nov 30, 2018. 57 (45%) of 127 HIV-negative participants were PrEP-aware and only 14 (11%) of 129 were currently taking PrEP. HIV-negative participants experiencing social (eg, violence, poverty) and interpersonal (eg, discrimination, low transgender women community connectedness) hardship reported PrEP awareness more frequently than HIV-negative transgender women who did not. Willingness to take PrEP was low, at 56 (55%) of 102, among HIV-negative participants who were not currently taking PrEP, and negatively associated with transgender women community connectedness (multivariable prevalence ratio 0·87; 95% CI 0·77–0·99). Barriers to PrEP included taking a daily pill, side-effects, and cost. Participants urged greater education and engagement of transgender women in PrEP implementation.

575,"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Attaining equality between women and men and eliminating all forms of discrimination are fundamental human rights and United Nations values. Nevertheless, women globally suffer violations of their human rights throughout their lives. This necessitates investigation of the attitude that people hold towards women empowerment, which is defined as their ability to practice their rights, freedom and attain resources within a framework of gender inequality. The purpose of this study is to develop an instrument to measure attitudes regarding women’s empowerment, which can develop better understanding and future interventions to counter these negative attitudes for better social and health care, including mental and physical health. Design/methodology/approach: The factorial structure, reliability, content validity and impact of gender on factor structure of scale were examined among university students (N = 500) in study with male (n = 180) and female (n = 320) population. Findings: Exploratory factor analysis using direct oblimin method based on principal component analysis indicated a three-factor, 16-item scale including subscales of personal freedom; equal rights and women empowerment-related fears. Instrument exhibited decent reliability (0.80) and content validity in both male and female university students with a t = −7.64, p = 0.00, suggesting a highly significant difference between the two genders on the developed scale. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation was that the sample was obtained from student population; therefore, it will not be entirely correct to generalize it to the whole population of Pakistan. Similarly, there are issues regarding the availability of students because of a busy schedule or not having interest to take part in the study that led to variance in the sample. Lastly, the current scale is developed based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and it should be further enhanced using item response theory in future. Future studies need to include samples from different populations in Pakistan to bring out a more generalized view and try to minimize the variances in sample as much as possible for better results. Practical implications: The scale is constructed using the basic features of women empowerment at its core and is applicable in various settings to measure the attitude towards women empowerment. It will be a helpful tool to be used in various health, employment and educational settings. Moreover, this instrument can be applied for research purpose of measuring attitude as a predictor in combination with other variables such as domestic violence and harassment. Social implications: Empowering of women is one of the main agendas of 2019 of United Nations for Asian countries where women are not given equal rights, because of which suffer socially and economically from various problems along with issues regarding physical and mental health. By identifying the attitudes of general population, their causes for their attitudes can help in betterment of the women empowerment process. Originality/value: This paper in discussion is an original work and has been performed with the purpose of assessing attitudes of males and females regarding women empowerment as the previous measures are either not psychometric valid or are in interview or survey form. The current developed scale is an attempt to develop an instrument that can be globally used.",2020-12-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare,21100834354,9,13,Psychometric development and validation of attitude rating scale towards women empowerment: across male and female university population in Pakistan,0,false,10.1108/IJHRH-12-2019-0090,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,2020.0,64.0,0.0,,575,1640417858,Kanwar Hamza Shuja,1564733833,M.

However, its application to the Malaysian setting as well as its relation to gender equality attitudes is rarely explored. Therefore, this research guided by the social constructionist perspective aims to examine the relationship between gender role (masculinity and femininity) and attitudes towards inequitable gender norms. A sample of 168 Malaysian men completed the two measures of Gender Equitable Men scale and the BSRI. Results showed that there was a significant relationship between gender role and attitudes towards inequitable gender norms. In contrast to the femininity gender role, masculinity gender role in men contributes to gender inequality attitudes. The findings in this study are largely supporting the theory that masculinity may be a key construct in the men’s negative attitudes about gender equality, which has been shown to be an important predictor of achieving women’s right and empowerment.

Reported gambling in males and females associated with lifetime use of any drugs, marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, heroin, methamphetamines, ecstasy, synthetic marijuana, non-medical pain-relievers, and injected drugs, in addition to past-30-days cigarette smoking, alcohol and heavy alcohol drinking, and marijuana use. Gambling associated with reported weapon-carrying, being threatened or injured with a weapon, forced sexual intercourse, bullying, and electronic bullying in males; physical dating violence in females; and physical fighting and sexual dating violence in both groups. Gambling and gender interaction terms did not associate with outcome measures except synthetic marijuana use, which trended towards significance (P = 0.052).

This requires adequate planning in order to optimize both resources and budget, which demands a thorough understanding of the magnitude of the problem, as well as analysis of its past impact in order to infer future incidence. On the other hand, for years, the rise of Machine Learning techniques and Big Data has led different countries to collect information on both GBV and other general social variables that in one way or another can affect violence levels. In this work, in order to forecast GBV, firstly, a database of features related to more than a decade’s worth of GBV is compiled and prepared from official sources available due to Spain’s open access. Then, secondly, a methodology is proposed that involves testing different methods of features selection so that, with each of the subsets generated, four techniques of predictive algorithms are applied and compared.

583,"© 2020 The Author(s)Working with men to prevent their perpetration of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence is increasingly recognised as effective. However, in any given context there are a multiplicity of masculinities, each of which has a different association with violence perpetration. There remains lack of clarity about whether such interventions impact all men and masculinities equally. We undertook a post-hoc analysis of men involved in the successful Stepping Stones and Creating Futures cluster randomized control trial in Durban, South Africa, to assess: i) whether there were different groups of men, ii) the factors associated with group allocation, and iii) whether the intervention had a differential impact on these groups in terms of violence perpetration. We used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify masculinity classes, based on fit statistics and theoretical plausibility, and then used descriptive statistics (numbers, percentages, means) and p-values and multinomial models (95% confidence intervals, p-values) to assess factors associated with allocation to each class. To assess intervention impact by group, we used an intention-to-treat analysis, comparing men in each masculinity class, by intervention and control arm, using generalized estimating equations reporting unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (aORs). In total 674 were recruited at baseline, and the LCA identified three classes of men: high violence (29% of men), medium violence (50% of men) and low violence (21% of men). Multinomial models showed those in more violent classes were more supportive of violence, had more adverse experiences, more depression and had worked more. By masculinity class, the impact of SS-CF showed reductions among the most violent men, with significant reductions in past year physical IPV (aOR0.59, p = 0.014), emotional IPV (aOR0.44, p = 0.044) and economic IPV (aOR0.35, p = 0.004), with non-significant reductions among other classes of men.

Adolescents living in rural settings may often experience poverty and a host of risk factors which can increase their vulnerability to various forms of health risk behavior (HRB). Understanding HRB clustering and its underlying factors among adolescents is important for intervention planning and health promotion. This study examines the co-occurrence of injury and violence, substance use, hygiene, physical activity, and diet-related risk behaviors among adolescents in a rural setting on the Kenyan coast. Specifically, the study objectives were to identify clusters of HRB; based on five categories of health risk behavior, and to identify the factors associated with HRB clustering. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted of a random sample of 1060 adolescents aged 13–19 years living within the area covered by the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Participants completed a questionnaire on health behaviors which was administered via an Audio Computer-Assisted Self–Interview. Latent class analysis on 13 behavioral factors (injury and violence, hygiene, alcohol tobacco and drug use, physical activity, and dietary related behavior) was used to identify clustering and stepwise ordinal logistic regression with nonparametric bootstrapping identified the factors associated with clustering. The variables of age, sex, education level, school attendance, mental health, form of residence and level of parental monitoring were included in the initial stepwise regression model. Results We identified 3 behavioral clusters (Cluster 1: Low-risk takers (22.9%); Cluster 2: Moderate risk-takers (67.8%); Cluster 3: High risk-takers (9.3%)). Relative to the cluster 1, membership of higher risk clusters (i.e. moderate or high risk-takers) was strongly associated with older age (p<0.001), being male (p<0.001), depressive symptoms (p = 0.005), school nonattendance (p = 0.001) and a low level of parental monitoring (p<0.001).

587,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdPopulations in the global south are disproportionately exposed to the stressors of development, disaster and armed conflict, all of which heighten cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We consider how war-related stressors exert a lasting influence upon population health, in particular the cardiovascular health of war survivors now entering older adulthood. Data come from the 2018 Vietnam Health and Aging Study conducted among 2447 northern Vietnamese adults age 60 and older. We conduct survey-adjusted logistic regression analyses to examine the associations among respondents' wartime exposure to combat and physical threat, malevolent environment conditions, and four CVD conditions (hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, and stroke). We examine posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as it mediates the association between wartime stress exposures and late life CVD, and gender as it moderates the relationship between wartime stressors and CVD. We find that exposure to wartime combat and violence, as well as malevolent living conditions, exhibit significant, positive associations with cardiovascular conditions. These associations are mediated by the severity of recent PTSD symptoms. For certain CVD conditions, particularly hypertension, the associations between wartime stressors and late life cardiovascular conditions diverge across gender with women experiencing a greater penalty for their exposure to war-related stressors than their male counterparts. We conclude that the stressors of war and resultant PTSD, widespread in this cohort of Vietnamese older adults who endured myriad forms of war exposure during their young adulthood, exhibit modest, yet significant associations with late-life cardiovascular conditions.

590,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdRationale: The association between male partner alcohol use and increased risk and severity of their perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) is well-established in quantitative research. However, few studies have explored the nature and trajectory of relationships involving partner drinking and abuse, and how women find pathways to safety. Objective and method: We conducted in-depth interviews with a community sample of 18 Australian women (aged 20–50 years) who reported feeling afraid when their male partner drank alcohol. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we identified key processes underpinning women's experience of alcohol-related IPV and mapped these over four relationship phases. Results: Partner alcohol use played a key role in how women interpreted and dealt with IPV victimisation. In early relationships, women spoke of not seeing or dismissing early warning signs of problem drinking and aggression in settings that normalized men's heavy drinking. Later, women identified patterns of inter-connected drinking and aggression, leading to questioning their reality, trying to ‘fix’ their partner's drinking to stop the abuse, and in the absence of change, learning to manage daily life around the drinking and abuse. In the third phase, giving up hope that the partner would stop drinking, women ended the relationship. Finally, after leaving the abuser, women attempted to reset normal around drinking behaviour but continued to experience trauma associated with others' drinking in social settings. Discussion and conclusion: For women who have experienced partners' alcohol use intertwined with violence in their relationship, changing their partners' drinking plays a central role in their journey to safety, possibly obscuring recognition of abuse and complicating their ability to leave. Greater understanding of the stages of the alcohol-IPV relationship can help health providers support women as they navigate these complex relationships, and provide appropriate support depending on the needs of women in their relationship trajectory.",2020-11-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,4,264,Relationship trajectories of women experiencing alcohol-related intimate partner violence: A grounded-theory analysis of women's voices,0,false,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113307,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2020.0,57.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Greater understanding of the stages of the alcohol-IPV relationship can help health providers support women as they navigate these complex relationships, and provide appropriate support depending on the needs of women in their relationship trajectory.'}",590,5529428,Ingrid M.

591,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdDecreasing violence is an important objective for the society. Although the topic has been addressed in different studies, most of them are cross-sectional, focus on one context or include few variables. This research aims to investigate to what extent moral disengagement and victimization are risk factors, and empathy and social and emotional competencies are protective factors for the development of violent behavior one year later in different contexts, such as school or home. Children and adolescents were the target population since violent behavior usually starts early in life. A sample of 871 students from different schools in Andalusia (Spain) was selected for this longitudinal research with a year of follow-up. Moral disengagement was more important in the prediction of violent behaviors and peer violence than in direct violence towards adults. Bullying victimization was a risk factor for violence one year later at home and at school. Differences in empathy and social and emotional competencies between perpetrators and non-perpetrators were found. Male gender and a young age were predictors of violence. Reducing victimization at school could be important in decreasing violence in different contexts in the future. Training parents in social and emotional competencies could be useful for the young people who learn the strategies for problem solving from parents.

This condition has a detrimental impact on the mother-infant caregiving relationship and hastens the infant's cognitive, emotional and social development. However, a shortage of empirical evidence existed especially in developing countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, we implemented this study to determine the magnitude of postpartum depression and its correlates. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was implemented on 378 postnatal women in the maternal and child health clinic of Dessie health centers within 4 weeks of their delivery. Postpartum depression was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Intimate partner violence was operationalized as a psychological, physical and sexual abusive action imposed on women by their associates. We estimated the crude and adjusted odds ratio with its 95% CI using binary logistic regression to know the association and statistical significance was declared using a p-value < 0.05. Results: More than one-fourth, 102 (27%) (95% CI 22.5, 31.5) of participants were obtained to have postpartum depression.

Many organizations have conducted research to identify that violence against women is a deep-rooted issue and has existed for many years. Institutions and women-led groups have gathered to provide assistance and governments have done a lot to least to support the cause. But the severity of this social pandemic is still unresolved across the globe. Research shows that contact with nature reduces the incidence of aggression and violence within family members in a household. Research also shows that air pollution and aggressive behavior are correlated. This paper provides a multi-modal approach to measure Gender-Based Violence Index (GBVI) by detecting the coverage of green canopies using satellite imagery in addition to sensing the level of atmospheric pollution to calculate violence occurrences before they even happen in a given neighborhood. To support the identification process, computer vision technique will be applied to satellite imagery to measure and map out the Vegetation Index (VI) on a scale of 0-100 in a neighborhood along with using air pollution sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) to detect the level of intoxicants that aggravate the cause of violence against women.

The objective of this study is to analyze different forms of CPV and their relationship with two groups of variables. The first group includes gender, age, family structure, school year, academic performance, drug use, frequency of drug use and diagnosis of psychopathology. The second analyzes exposure to violence, parental warmth, self-concept, sexism, narcissism and psychopathy. The participants were 225 high school students from 14 to 20 years old, 54.7% of them girls. The CPV rates were lower than those of previous Spanish studies but similar to those in other countries. Most participants engaged in only one behavior, insulting, and hitting never appeared alone, but in combination with at least two other behaviors. The analysis of the data showed that the ability of the variables under study to predict CPV varies for each specific behavior.

Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study in the Women's Interagency HIV Study, 1994- 2018. Poisson models were fitted using generalized estimating equations to estimate the association of past 6-month GBV experience (physical, sexual, or intimate partner psychological violence) with subsequent self-reported STI diagnosis (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, pelvic inflammatory disease, or trichomoniasis). Results: Data from 2868 women who reported recent sexual activity comprised 12,069 person-years. Higher STI risk was observed among HIV-seropositive women (incidence rate [IR] 5.5 per 100 person-years) compared with HIV-seronegative women (IR 4.3 per 100 person-years). Recent GBV experience was associated with a 1.28-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99, 1.65) risk after adjustment for HIV status and relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and sexual risk variables. Other important risk factors for STI acquisition included unstable housing (adjusted incidence rate ratio [AIRR] 1.81, 95% CI 1.32-2.46), unemployment (AIRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.76), transactional sex (AIRR 2.06, 95% CI 1.52-2.80), and drug use (AIRR 1.44, 95% CI 1.19- 1.75). Recent physical violence contributed the highest risk of STI acquisition among HIV-seronegative women (AIRR 2.27, 95% CI 1.18-4.35), whereas lifetime GBV experience contributed the highest risk among HIVseropositive women (AIRR 1.59, 95% CI 1.20-2.10).

We explored predictors of learning skills and depression in Indian adolescents. Methods Data on adolescents aged 10-19y (three groups: 5,840 unmarried males, 8,953 unmarried females, 4,933 married females) were available from the state-representative Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults survey in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for cluster sampling design and state fixed effects were used to examine factors (demographic, health/nutrition, social, and environmental) associated with three outcomes: Reading proficiency, math proficiency, and depressive symptoms. Findings Learning skills were poor (28-61% lacked basic reading and math skills depending on adolescent group and outcome) and depression was common (8-26%). Better learning skills were predicted by greater household wealth (AOR 1.72-2.55 depending on group) and household head education (AOR 1.03-1.07 per year), being in school (AOR 4.19-18.65), parental support (AOR 1.11-1.39), having gender equal attitudes (AOR 1.56-2.67), number of food groups consumed at least weekly (unmarried females: AOR 1.11), and having an improved latrine (AOR 1.33-1.51). Poorer learning skills were predicted by family substance use (AOR 0.68-0.74), underweight (males: AOR 0.74), witnessing parental violence (AOR 0.66-0.78). Depressive symptoms were predicted by witnessing parental violence (AOR 1.51-1.92) and experiencing sexual abuse (AOR 2.30-6.16).

METHODS: Separate Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify profiles of both victimization and mental health symptoms for participants (N = 15,624). Subsequently, stratified weighted logistic regression models were used on an eligible analytic sample of 11,458 to assess differences in the association of victimization and mental health between LGBQ and heterosexual high school students. RESULTS: In each LCA, participants were assigned to one of 3 classes for victimization (minimal, 81.3%; bullying, 12.5%; or physical/sexual violence, 6.2%) and 1 of 2 classes for mental health symptoms (minimal, 81.2%; severe, 18.8%). LGBQ participants were overrepresented in physical/sexual violence and bullying victimization profiles. Both bullying and physical/sexual violence profiles were associated with almost 5 times the odds of endorsing severe mental health symptoms.

607,"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: The link between facial affect recognition and criminal justice involvement has been extensively researched, yet there are virtually no data on the capacity for facial affect recognition in post-incar+cerated individuals, and the results of many studies are limited due to a narrow focus on psychopathy rather than offence category. Aims: To test the first hypothesis that individuals reporting a history of a violent offence would show a deficit in facial affect recognition and the second hypothesis that the violent offender's deficit would be exclusive to recognition of negative expressions, not affecting positive or neutral expressions. Method: Post-incarcerated individuals (N = 298) were recruited online through Qualtrics and completed questionnaires assessing their criminal justice background and demographics. They completed measures of facial affect recognition, anxiety and depression, and components of aggression. Results: A logistic regression, including sex, ethnicity, age and years of education and depression/anxiety scores, indicated that committing a violent offence was independently associated with lower facial affect recognition scores as well as male gender and a trait-based propensity towards physical aggression, but no other co-variable. These data provided no evidence that this deficit was specific to negative emotions. Conclusions and implications for future research/practice: Our study is one of the first to examine facial affect recognition in a post-incarcerated sample. It suggests that deficits in facial affect recognition, already well documented among violent prisoners, persist. While acknowledging that these may be relatively fixed characteristics, this study also suggests that, for these people, nothing happening during their imprisonment was touching this.

609,"© 2020, The Author(s).Multivariate models for spatial count data are currently receiving attention in disease mapping to model two or more diseases jointly. They have been thoroughly studied from a theoretical point of view, but their use in practice is still limited because they are computationally expensive and, in general, they are not implemented in standard software to be used routinely. Here, a new multivariate proposal, based on the recently derived M models for spatial data, is developed for spatio-temporal areal data. The model takes account of the correlation between the spatial and temporal patterns of the phenomena being studied, and it also includes spatio-temporal interactions. Though multivariate models have been traditionally fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, here we propose to adopt integrated nested Laplace approximations to speed up computations as results obtained using both fitting techniques were nearly identical. The techniques are used to analyse two forms of crimes against women in India. In particular, we focus on the joint analysis of rapes and dowry deaths in Uttar Pradesh, the most populated Indian state, during the years 2001–2014.",2020-10-01,Journal,Article,Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,19010,10,34,Bayesian inference in multivariate spatio-temporal areal models using INLA: analysis of gender-based violence in small areas,1,true,10.1007/s00477-020-01808-x,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbHinfo@springer-sbm.com,Stochastic environmental research and risk assessment (Print),2020.0,74.0,0.0,,609,2084776142,G.

In a 2017 cross-sectional study of rectal STI screening and HIV prevention, MSM/TW completed a sociobehavioral survey addressing demographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use, and were tested for rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV.

This study examined stalker gender, course-of-conduct, threats and safety efficacy, and the association of those factors on stalking-related fear and mental health outcomes for men (n = 218) and women (n = 478) stalked by (ex)partners (n = 285) and non-partners (n = 411) within the past 5 years. Results showed that women had higher stalking-related-fear; but they were also more likely to be targeted by male (ex)partner stalkers than men. Even so, men who were stalked by males had higher stalking-related fear, after controlling for other factors, than men who were stalked by women. Further, (ex)partner stalkers were more threatening, interfering, and assaultive than non-partner stalkers. Safety efficacy, or perceived capability in handling a threatening situation, played a key role in mental health outcomes for both men and women stalking victims. Also, one-third of stalking victims, regardless of stalker type, indicated they also experienced proxy stalking.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on the queer theory, Foucault’s works on sexuality and power, Segato’s theory about war against women’s bodies and on a fieldwork realized between 2015 and 2019 in Mexico City, with prisoners and former prisoners. Findings: The sexuality dispositif works in a particular way inside prison. It is the result of the heteropatriarchal model and laws defined by both prisoners and prison workers, all involved in the Mexican war context. The effects are materialized through violence toward trans* women whose bodies serve for rape, male appropriation and exchange between powerful subjects. Research limitations/implications: This paper produces knowledge about imprisonned trans* people, a very few developped field in prison studies, especially in Latin America. Practical implications: The paper demonstrates how specific violence toward trans* women imprisoned in a male prison in Mexico City deepens violent dynamics that occur out of the prison. So, it questions the meaning of a sentence in the actual Mexican prison system. It may help to think about staff’s training/education to guarantee basic human rights for imprisoned trans* people. Additionally, the theorization of “internal law” could help prison authorities to rethink classification and treatment for prisoners. Social implications: This paper provide specific knowledge on imprisonned trans* women and helps to think and act different with this people through the understanding of their special vulnerability. Originality/value: There are only a few papers about imprisoned trans population throughout the world and fewer in Latin America and Mexico. Additionally, this paper aims to overcome the “internal order” as it is always theorized as proper of detainees. It wants to show that the prison order in a Mexico City prison, borns from the meeting of cultural specificities from outside and inside, and from both prisoners, organized crime and prison staff.",2020-09-15,Journal,Article,"Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice",21100830426,0,6,The dispositif of prison sexuality: transphobic violence in a Mexican male prison,0,false,10.1108/JCRPP-01-2020-0015,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,2020.0,13.0,0.0,,613,2080837574,Chloe Constant,,,,,,,,,,,9.0,19.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology
614,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: dating violence, or violence in teenage couples, is a socially interesting topic, due to its prevalence and its possible use in predicting violence in adult couples. The perception of violence, or the detection of abusive behaviors by teenagers and young people (which can be considered as equivalent concepts), is essential to prevent violence itself. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to determine which behaviors are identified as abusive by teenagers and young people, and the severity that they attribute to them—meaning how they perceive them. Moreover, we will be able to determine whether there are differences between boys and girls in two countries: Spain and Colombia. Methods: for this study, we used two samples from both countries, with a total of 389 teenagers (50.9% females and 49.1% males) who were, on average, 16.56 years old (SD = 1.94 years). We analyzed the factorial invariance depending on sex and country of the sample and the different profiles of violence perception. Results: we found evidence of the internal validity of the questionnaire for what concerns the perception of inter-partner violence. The results point out that the perception of violence in the relationship is composed of two factors related to each other (Multiple and Emotional Abuse), which are invariant depending of sex and country of origin of the sample. The internal consistency of the test is adequate (>0.90). The analysis of the violence perception profiles indicates that Spanish teenagers have a higher perception of it, and, also, that girls hold a higher perception than boys. Conclusions: the results of this research have shown how dating violence (or violence in teenage couples) is differentially perceived not only between genders, but also across cultural contexts. Moreover, these outcomes may enhance the development of possible evidence-based interventions approaching the social problem generated by violence in teenage couples.",2020-09-02,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,5,17,Perception of dating violence in teenage couples: A cross validation study in Spain and Colombia,1,true,10.3390/ijerph17186769,MDPI AGdiversity@mdpi.com,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2020.0,62.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'How dating violence is differentially perceived not only between genders, but also across cultural contexts is shown, which may enhance the development of possible evidence-based interventions approaching the social problem generated by violence in teenage couples.'}",614,1960186143,Ana Martínez-Dorado,5824231,J.

Fenoglio” Red Cross Reception Centre, one of the largest Italian regional hubs; to evaluate if, based on these data, it is possible to hypothesize an underreporting of SGBV from these women.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 2,484 asylum-seeking females hosted in the centre for initial-reception of Piedmont and Valle d’Aosta regions (Northern Italy) between June 2016 and December 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: prevalence of SGBV. RESULTS: among the women arrived at the centre, 46 reported being victim of SGBV during their journey to Italy (prevalence: 1.85%; 95%CI 1.39-2.46), 37 of which with reliable and verified data supported by health certification doc-umentation (prevalence: 1.49%; 95%CI 1.08-2.05). Women who suffered SGBV have a higher prevalence of diseases than their counterpart (more blood, digestive, neurological, psy-chological, genital diseases, and AIDS), are more frequently pregnant, and asked more frequently for a voluntary inter-ruption of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: the low prevalence of SGBV identified sug-gests that underreporting and under-recognition of the phe-nomenon are possible.

616,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Th.Sex and gender deeply affect the subjective effects and pharmaco-toxicological responses to drugs. Men are more likely than women to use almost all types of illicit drugs and to present to emergency departments for serious or fatal intoxications. However, women are just as likely as men to develop substance use disorders, and may be more susceptible to craving and relapse. Clinical and preclinical studies have shown important differences between males and females after administration of “classic” drugs of abuse (e.g., Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), morphine, cocaine). This scenario has become enormously complicated in the last decade with the overbearing appearance of the new psychoactive substances (NPS) that have emerged as alternatives to regulated drugs. To date, more than 900 NPS have been identified, and can be catalogued in different pharmacological categories including synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic stimulants (cathinones and amphetamine-like), hallucinogenic phenethylamines, synthetic opioids (fentanyls and non-fentanyls), new benzodiazepines and dissociative anesthetics (i.e., methoxetamine and phencyclidine-derivatives).

619,"© 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.Background Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are important public health concerns among black men who have sex with men only (BMSMO), as well as those who have sex with both men and women (BMSMW). Sexually transmitted infections also increase risk of acquiring and HIV, which is also a critical concern. Compared with BMSMO, research shows that BMSMW experience elevated levels of HIV/STI vulnerability factors occurring at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and social/structural levels. These factors may work independently, increasing one's risk of engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors, but often work in a synergistic and reinforcing manner. The synergism and reinforcement of any combination of these factors are known as a syndemic, which increases HIV/STI risk. Methods Data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 061 study (n = 799) was used to conduct a latent profile analysis to identify unique combinations of risk factors that may form a syndemic and that may vary between BMSMO and BMSMW. We hypothesized that the convergence of syndemic factors would differ between groups and predict sexual risk and subsequent incident STI. Results For BMSMO who had a high sexual risk profile, the syndemic factors characterizing this group included perceived racism, incarceration, intimate partner violence, depression, and binge drinking. For BMSMW with a high sexual risk profile, the syndemic factors that characterized this group were incarceration, depression, and binge drinking.

As a result, more and more research is proposing the identification, analysis and intervention of these attitudes. However, the vast majority of this research focuses on students. The main objective of this paper is to analyze these supportive attitudes throughout the lifecycle. An opportunity sample of 200 Spanish participants, by age and sex fixed quotas, took part in this study. Attitudes were measured using the Inventory of Distorted Thoughts about Women and Violence, the Inventory of Beliefs about Intimate Partner Violence and the Gender Violence Implicit Association Test, a personalized form of Implicit Association Test (IAT). The results show that explicitly measured supportive attitudes towards intimate partner violence against women differ between age groups, adopting a U-shape distribution: lower acceptance among middle-aged-adults and young-adults and higher acceptance among adolescents and older adults. However, when these attitudes were implicitly measured, the IPVAW rejection increased with age, which is a counter-intuitive result and inconsistent with previous theoretical evidence. In summary, these results support an age effect that differs according to the measure of attitudes used and highlight some difficulties related to based-on-reaction-time measures among older people.

621,"© 2016 american psychological association.Objective: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is prevalent in college dating relationships, with bidirectional violence most common. Some studies have suggested that investment model constructs (low relationship investment, satisfaction, or commitment, and high quality of alternatives to the relationship) might serve as risk factors for IPV perpetration. The present study builds on existing literature by using an online diary methodology to assess whether prior-day victimization, perpetration, and investment model variables predict next-day physical and psychological IPV perpetration, as well as whether gender moderates these associations. Method: Undergraduates currently in relationships (n = 827; 32.6% men) completed 20 days of online daily questionnaires assessing day-level IPV perpetration and victimization and investment model variables. Results: Using multilevel logistic models, psychological IPV perpetration was predicted by the presence of prior-day physical IPV perpetration and the absence of prior-day physical and psychological victimization; person-level investment model variables were not associated with psychological perpetration. By contrast, prior-day physical perpetration was positively associated with next-day physical perpetration among women, and negatively associated among men. Person-level decreases in relationship satisfaction and increases in perceived relationship alternatives were associated with day-level increases in physical perpetration.

623,"© The Author(s) 2017.Most research on alcohol consumption and related sexual violence focuses on Western societies. Drawing on traditional masculinity scripts, this article contributes to the culturally specific understanding of how Nigerian sociocultural constructions of alcohol consumption facilitate sexual violence against women. In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 male and female undergraduate students (aged 19-23 years), exploring how the gendering of alcoholic beverages facilitates men’s perpetration of sexual violence against women in a Nigerian university. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 10 software. Men were found to exclude women from consuming beer, which they described as “inappropriate” feminine behavior, confining them to drinking sweetened/flavored alcoholic beverages. To maintain a notion of “respectable” femininity, women consumed these drinks, but this created gender-specific risks. In comparison with beer, sweetened alcoholic beverages have a higher alcohol content, which many of the men were aware of, unlike the women interviewed. Some men admitted buying such drinks for women, pressuring them to drink above their limits and raping them when they were inebriated.

This study aims to evaluate parental nurturing and associated social, economic, and political factors among Palestinian children living in the West Bank (WB). Methods: Secondary data representative of the Palestinian children living in the WB was used to estimate parental nurturing for children aged 0-12 years as reported by their mothers. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted, followed by multivariate analysis for all predictors found significant in the bivariate analysis using SPSS® version 20. Results: 19.90% (231/1162) of children experienced low levels of parental nurturing. No statistically significant differences were detected by the child's gender. Children with high levels of parental nurturing were those aged 0-6 years, children who were last in the family index, children with no disability, children exposed to low to medium levels of disciplinary methods, children from urban areas, children living in North WB, and children whose families were not subjected to political violence. Conclusions: Overall, Palestinian mothers reported high levels of parental nurturing towards their children. However, about one-fifth of Palestinian children are at risk of experiencing low levels of parental nurturing. Efforts should be placed in addressing the health and welfare needs of these high-risk children's groups.",2020-08-29,Journal,Article,BMC Pediatrics,14521,0,20,"Assessment of parental nurturing and associated social, economic, and political factors among children in the West Bank of the occupied Palestinian territory (WB/oPt)",1,true,10.1186/s12887-020-02317-0,BioMed Central Ltd info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Pediatrics,2020.0,78.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Overall, Palestinian mothers reported high levels of parental nurturing towards their children, however, about one-fifth of Palestinian children are at risk of experiencing low levels of Parental nurturing.'}",626,35109820,N.

628,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Accurately identifying the magnitude of gender-based violence (GBV) in humanitarian settings is hindered by logistical and methodological complexities. The 'Neighborhood Method', an adapted household survey that uses primary and secondary reporting to assess the prevalence of GBV in humanitarian settings, reduces the length of time and cost associated with traditional surveys. Primary female adult respondents disclose incidents of physical violence, intimate and non-intimate partner rape for themselves, other females in their homes (standard reporting) and other women and children in their social networks (secondary reporting). This study examines the reliability and validity of this inclusion of secondary reporting to determine the comparability of the Neighborhood Method to a traditional survey approach. Methods: Drawing on data from 1180 women reporting on 3744 females in respondent households and 15,086 in neighboring households across four humanitarian settings (Ethiopia/ Somalia, Liberia, Sri Lanka, and Uganda), reliability of secondary reporting was measured through intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Cohen's kappas. Validity was assessed using two-sample z-tests for differences between standard versus secondary reporting. Results: Prevalence estimates comparing a respondent's household with a neighboring household show closer agreement (ICC: 0.999-0.986) than self-reports vs. secondary reporting on a female counterpoint in a neighboring home (ICC: 0.939-0.98). Kappa statistics analyzing the reliability of two separate neighbors reporting on a third neighbor showed moderate agreement beyond chance alone (κ = 0.45 for physical violence and 0.48 for rape). Prevalence rates corresponded between standard and secondary reports (i.e. showed no statistical difference) in 18 out of 24 compared populations.

Exposure to multiple forms of interpersonal violence, referred to as polyvictimization, has been associated with more severe health consequences than exposure to any form separately. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of emotional, physical and sexual interpersonal violence in childhood, adulthood and at both childhood and adulthood among men and women in Estonia, analyze the patterns of interpersonal violence and socio-demographic correlates of polyvictimization in adulthood by gender. Methods The analysis was based on two population-based, cross-sectional, self-administered surveys carried out among men and women in Estonia in 2014. In both surveys, the NorVold Abuse questionnaire was used to measure exposure to interpersonal violence. Men and women aged 18-44 were included to the analysis. Results Among men 66.6% and among women 54.2% had been exposed to at least one form of interpersonal violence during lifetime. Men had been more often exposed to isolated physical interpersonal violence, among women the distribution of different forms of interpersonal violence was more even and exposure to sexual violence was more common. The prevalence of polyvictimization in adulthood was two times higher among women compared to men and more socio-demographic correlates, were associated with it. Exposure to violence in childhood was associated with polyvictimization in adulthood across gender. Conclusions The prevalence of interpersonal violence in Estonia is high among men and women. The most prevalent forms and patterns of interpersonal violence, however, differ by gender, as do the socio-demographic correlates. Screening for interpersonal violence, in childhood and adulthood, and gender-specific interventions are needed, especially for high-risk groups identified in this study.

631,"© 2020 The AuthorsBackground: In resource-limited contexts, available data indicate that people with disability are disproportionally affected by the HIV epidemic. While disability resulting from chronic HIV infection has received some attention, few epidemiologic studies have examined the vulnerability of people with disability to HIV acquisition. The aims of the study were as follows: to estimate and compare HIV prevalence among people with and without disability living in Bujumbura, Burundi; to examine how the interaction among disability, gender and socioeconomic environment shapes vulnerability to HIV; and to identify potential pathways to higher HIV risk. Methods: In this cross-sectional population-based study, 623 persons with disability (302 with disability onset ≤10 years [“early disability”]) and 609 persons without disability matched for age, sex and location were randomly selected to be tested for HIV and to participate in an interview about their life history, their social environment and their knowledge of sexual health. Findings: A total of 68% of men and 75% of women with disability were affected by multidimensional poverty compared to 54% and 46% of their peers without disability (p<0.0001). Higher HIV prevalence was observed among women with disability (12.1% [8.2–16]) than among those without (3.8% [1.7–6], ORa 3.8, p<0.0001), while it was similar among men with disability and those without (p = 0·8). Women with disability were also at higher risk of sexual violence than were those without (ORa 2.7, p<0.0001). The vulnerability of women with early disability to HIV was higher among those who were socially isolated (HIV prevalence in this group: 19% [12–27]). In addition, education level and sexual violence mediated 53% of the association between early disability and HIV (p = 0.001). Interpretation: This study highlights how the intersection of disability, gender and social environment shapes vulnerability to HIV. It also shows that the vulnerability to HIV of women who grew up with a disability is mediated by sexual violence.

632,"© 2020 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for AdolescentsIntroduction: Sexual minority youth (SMY) are at significantly greater risk for experiencing adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) than exclusively heterosexual youth, yet little is known about the factors that elevate their risks for such abuse. Peer victimization (i.e., bullying, sexual harassment) has been associated with ARA among heterosexual youth. SMY experience higher rates of peer victimization than heterosexual youth, suggesting that it may be a risk factor for ARA among these youth. Using longitudinal data from a community sample of adolescents recruited from the northeastern US, we examined whether sexual identity was associated prospectively with ARA, and whether that relationship would be indirect, and mediated via bullying and sexual harassment at a 12-month follow-up. We expected to find higher rates of peer victimization and ARA among SMY than heterosexual youth, and we expected that sexual harassment and bullying would predict subsequent relationship abuse. Methods: Adolescents (N = 800; 58% female; 81% European-American; 19% SMY) between 13 and 15 years (M = 14.45, SD = 0.85) completed a web survey at baseline, 6-months and 12-months. Results: Consistent with prior studies, SMY reported higher rates of bullying, sexual harassment, and relationship abuse than heterosexual youth. SMY who reported sexual harassment at baseline were more likely to report relationship abuse over time. Contrary to our expectations, however, bully victimization did not predict subsequent relationship abuse.

Some cases of sexual assault and rape are based on the use of so-called drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), which cause victims’ loss of consciousness and inability to defend, making them vulnerable to violence. Thus, this article aimed to review the literature on gender violence and the drugs used to facilitate sexual assault, addressing their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, as well as drug detection times in human body and types of forensic identification. It is understood that the knowledge of these drugs and their pharmacological and diagnostic mechanisms should be widely disseminated, especially about sensitivity tests and the time the drug remains in the body, which would validate the promotion of evidence to prove abuse, and, thus, being able to give a promising outcome to cases of aggression, which is extremely beneficial for women.",2020-08-01,Journal,Review,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,5100154502,11,74,Violence against women and drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA): A review of the main drugs,0,false,10.1016/j.jflm.2020.102020,Churchill Livingstone,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,2020.0,108.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This article aimed to review the literature on gender violence and the drugs used to facilitate sexual assault, addressing their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, as well as drug detection times in human body and types of forensic identification.'}",633,1816878578,Yanna Richelly de Souza Costa,4049205,Stefânia N Lavorato,2086075351,Julianna Joanna Carvalho Moraes de Campos Baldin,,,,,,,1.0,8.0,1.0,21.0,128.0,7.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,Medicine

Next, we tested the association between childhood exposure to paternal and/or maternal incarceration on adulthood psychopathic traits, criminal offending, and prospective prison violence over 12 months. Correlations showed the interpersonal facet was positively correlated with fraud-related crime and prison violence. The affective facet was positively correlated with violent crime and prison violence. The behavioral facet was associated with prison violence and drug-related crime. Multinomial logistic regressions showed higher interpersonal facet scores were associated with an increased likelihood of having experienced paternal incarceration. Higher affective facet scores, violent crime, and prison violence were associated with an increased likelihood of having experienced maternal incarceration, regardless of if the father had been incarcerated or not.

637,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The normalization of aggressive behavior in teenage couples when they are dating is a phenomenon that is currently reaching very worrying proportions. The consequences are creating a serious public health problem and have hence aroused the interest of many researchers as to its causes. Most have centered on the role of the aggressor. However, the processes of aggression and victimization are inseparable, and relegating the victims to the background only contributes to increasing the prevalence, severity, and perdurability of the problem. The objectives of this study were to: (i) identify the types and frequency of abuse that adolescents suffer in their relationships; (ii) analyze the relationship between sexist attitudes, acceptance of violence, and victimization; and (iii) determine predictors of the violence suffered in adolescent dating relationships. The sample comprised 2577 adolescents (55.2% girls) of 14 to 18 years in age (M = 15.9, SD = 1.2). The instruments used were the dating violence questionnaire (Cuestionario de Violencia de Novios, CUVINO) and the Scale of detection of sexism in adolescents (Escala de Detección de Sexismo en Adolescentes, DSA). The results indicate that victims showed high tolerance towards gender violence. Acceptance was greater the more frequent the abuse or aggressions suffered. Regarding sexist attitudes, only those belonging to the benevolent dimension had predictive value. The results also show that the interaction between acceptance of the abuse suffered and the manifestation of benevolent sexist attitudes predicted victimization involving specific forms of aggression.",2020-07-02,Journal,Article,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,144989,25,17,Synergy between acceptance of violence and sexist attitudes as a dating violence risk factor,1,true,10.3390/ijerph17145209,MDPI AGPostfachBaselCH-4005rasetti@mdpi.com,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2020.0,63.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results indicate that victims showed high tolerance towards gender violence, and the interaction between acceptance of the abuse suffered and the manifestation of benevolent sexist attitudes predicted victimization involving specific forms of aggression.'}",637,1422438224,I.

The study adopted a range of methods, including translation and back translation, expert reviews, cognitive debriefing, and test-retest reliability assessment. The EBS-C was validated in a purposive convenience sample of 718 Chinese-speaking participants (male = 362; female = 356) aged 18–24 (mean age = 21.4) in Hong Kong. The results of CFA showed a good model fit: CFI = .97, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .05, SRMR = .03. The EBS-C was also found to be significantly associated with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2; r = .13–.17, p < .01), depression (BDI-II: r = .15, p < .01), anxiety (GAD-7: r = .17, p < .01), interpersonal support (ISEL-12: r = -.27, p < .01), relationship satisfaction (RAS: r = -.36, p < .01), and self-esteem (RSES: r = -.22, p < .01). The study demonstrated the EBS-C to be a reliable and valid measure for assessing the psychological vulnerability of IPV victims. It is thus useful for identifying the risks such individuals face by assessing their experience of fear, danger, and disempowerment in the intimate relationship relative to abusive incident-based measures alone. The EBS-C will also be useful for developing effective treatments to address the psychological vulnerability resulting from IPV and will facilitate cross-cultural comparative research aimed at enriching our knowledge of IPV victimization.",2020-07-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,0,15,Validation of the scale for assessing the psychological vulnerability and its association with health of intimate partner violence victims in Chinese young adult population,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0235761,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,PLoS ONE,2020.0,67.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The study demonstrated the EBS-C to be a reliable and valid measure for assessing the psychological vulnerability of IPV victims, useful for identifying the risks such individuals face by assessing their experience of fear, danger, and disempowerment in the intimate relationship relative to abusive incident-based measures alone.'}",639,18367275,A.

All rights reserved.Background: Childhood trauma is reliably associated with smaller hippocampal volume in adults; however, this finding has not been shown in children, and even less is known about how sex and trauma interact to affect limbic structural development in children. Methods: Typically developing children aged 9 to 15 years who completed a trauma history questionnaire and structural T1-weighted MRI were included in this study (n = 172; 85 female, 87 male). All children who reported 4 or more traumas (n = 36) composed the high trauma group, and all children who reported 3 or fewer traumas (n = 136) composed the low trauma group. Using multivariate analysis of covariance, we compared FreeSurfer-derived structural MRI volumes (normalized by total intracranial volume) of the amygdalar, hippo-campal and parahippocampal regions by sex and trauma level, controlling for age and study site. Results: We found a significant sex × trauma interaction, such that girls with high trauma had greater volumes than boys with high trauma. Follow-up analyses indicated sig-nificantly increased volumes for girls and generally decreased volumes for boys, specifically in the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions for the high trauma group; we observed no sex differences in the low trauma group. We noted no interaction effect for the amygdalae. Limitations: We assessed a community sample and did not include a clinical sample. We did not collect data about the ages at which children experienced trauma. Conclusion: Results revealed that psychological trauma affects brain development differ-ently in girls and boys.

641,"© 2020 American Psychological Association.Objective: We explored the internal structure of within-group variation in the syndemic construct among bisexual adolescents, an understudied and highly vulnerable population known to experience health disparities compared with monosexuals (those attracted to a single gender). We sought to identify patterns of co-occurrence among three domains of high priority behavioral risks-sexual risk factors, substance use, and victimization-and their implications for suicidality. Method: We used a national sample of 1,053 ethnically/racially diverse, high school age bisexual adolescents drawn from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to 15 indicators measuring the three aforementioned domains and modeled predictors and an outcome of class membership. Results: Within-group variation in the syndemic construct appears categorical, systematic, and comprised of Low Risk (38%), Alcohol Use (20%), Peer-victimization (14%), Sexually Active (11%), Syndemic (11%), and Risk-taking (7%) classes. Classes were well-separated per classification statistics. The proportions of bisexual identification, sex, and race varied significantly across classes. Syndemic and Peer-victimization classes were equivalent and elevated in their suicidality risk, out of all classes. Conclusions: Results revealed multiple and diverging forms of conjoint behavioral risk that conferred differential health implications; illuminated the shape and functional form of the syndemic construct among bisexual adolescents; and illustrated the utility of LCA for classifying typologies of risky and normative health behavior patterns. Psychologists are recommended to carefully consider the comorbidly operant nature of behavioral risks in this population. Future directions include addressing replication, multiple-group invariance, additional auxiliary variables, and alternative mixture techniques. This study suggests that patterns of conjoint behavioral risk among bisexual adolescents can be classified into six subtypes: Low Risk (38%), Alcohol Use (20%), Peer-victimization (14%), Sexually Active (11%), Syndemic (11%), and Risk-taking (7%). The Syndemic and Peer-victimization classes were most at risk for suicidality, and girls and behaviorally bisexual adolescents were overrepresented in the riskier classes. Findings highlight the need for refined assessment and targeted intervention for hidden subgroups of bisexual adolescents that are most vulnerable to compounded behavioral risks and associated mortality.",2020-07-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,15439,5,88,Syndemic behavioral risk and suicidality among bisexual adolescents: A latent class analysis,0,false,10.1037/ccp0000500,American Psychological Association Inc.journals@apa.org,Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,2020.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results revealed multiple and diverging forms of conjoint behavioral risk that conferred differential health implications; illuminated the shape and functional form of the syndemic construct among bisexual adolescents; and illustrated the utility of LCA for classifying typologies of risky and normative health behavior patterns.'}",641,46730613,A.

642,"Copyright © 2020 by the Guttmacher InstituteCONTEXT: Intimate partner violence (IPV) among sexual minority young adults has been understudied, and victimization and perpetration estimates are needed. METHODS: Data on 13,653 women and men aged 24–32 who participated in Wave 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health were used to examine associations between sexual orientation and IPV perpetration and victimization in respondents’ current or most recent relationship. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify associations between respondent characteristics and three IPV categories (physical violence, threatened violence and forced sex). RESULTS: Some 94% of males and 80% of females identified as 100% heterosexual; 4% of males and 16% of females as mostly heterosexual; 1% of males and 2% of females as bisexual; and 2% of males and females as either mostly homosexual or 100% homosexual. Compared with their heterosexual counterparts, mostly heterosexual women were more likely to report having perpetrated or been a victim of physical IPV (odds ratios, 1.9 and 1.6, respectively), having threatened violence (2.0) and having been a victim of threatened violence and forced sex (1.6 for each); mostly heterosexual males were more likely to have been a perpetrator or victim of physical IPV (3.1 and 1.8, respectively) and a perpetrator of forced sex and threatened violence (2.0 and 1.8, respectively). Bisexual males had elevated odds of physical violence victimization (3.3) and forced sex victimization (4.9) and perpetration (5.0).

644,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdPrior research on students’ school victimization has mainly centered on the effect of students’ personal characteristics, namely gender and grade level. Although students’ personal traits cut across all cultures, a question too often overlooked is whether victimization patterns remain similar for different cultures and ethnicities. Further, gender and grade-level patterns may change across different ethnic and cultural contexts. This study employed analysis of variance to explore physical victimization patterns in schools by students’ gender, grade level (fifth or eighth grade), and ethnocultural affiliation (Arab or Jewish) using a nationally representative sample of students in Israel (N = 75,060). Because school violence may increase in the context of poverty, the study controlled for school and student socioeconomic background. The unique structure of schools organized around language and culture in Israel allowed for identification of systematic dissimilarities and commonalities among distinct ethnocultural groups of students. Greater victimization emerged among male, lower-grade, and minority-status students. The findings further indicate that ethnicity and culture not only influenced the level of students’ physical victimization, but also significantly changed the effect of gender and grade level across ethnocultural groups. Interaction effects showed a greater gender gap at eighth grade, compared with fifth grade, and a greater grade-level gap among minority students, compared with majority students. The increased gender gap across grade levels was more pronounced among minority students compared with majority students. This paper discusses the complex influence of culture and ethnicity on students’ victimization, considering socioeconomic status, distribution of authority, age hierarchy, and gender roles across cultural contexts.

645,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdAssessing an offender's level of risk is a vital step in the determination of treatment services; however, risk assessment tools have been consistently developed using a male cohort. Geraghty and Woodham (2015) conducted a review to determine the validity of risk assessment tools for females and found the Level of Service Inventory (LSI) to be the most valid. The LSI has been further developed and additional risk assessment tools have been included in the suite of assessments across various international jurisdictions; therefore, an updated review is necessary to encompass subsequent research. The current review is an international investigation into the relevance of risk assessment tools for females; however, Australia has not carried out extensive research in this area, particularly Western Australia which has an overrepresentation of Aboriginal offenders. As such, the focus was on studies that included risk assessment tools used in Australia including the Level of Service/Risk, Need, Responsivity (LS/RNR), the Violence Risk Scale (VRS), the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) and the Historic, Clinical and Risk 20 (HCR-20). Five databases were searched and included OVID Embase, OVID Medline, OVID PsycInfo, OVID full text and PsycARTICLES and elicited 610 studies with a further three sourced from gray literature. The articles were assessed based on pre-determined criteria which resulted in 18 studies reviewed in detail. It was identified that all four risk assessment tools were valid for use with female offenders; however, this was not consistent with the findings from a single Australian study, likely due to the combination of a small sample and low base rates of reoffending. Further research is needed on gender comparisons to consider potential gender differences in factors and items that form the risk assessment tools so that treatment and risk management pans may be optimised for female offenders.",2020-07-01,Journal,Review,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,2,53,The predictive validity of risk assessment tools used in Australia for female offenders: A systematic review,0,false,10.1016/j.avb.2020.101428,Elsevier Ltd,,2020.0,82.0,1.0,,645,2051012027,M.

646,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe #MeToo campaign has put under the spotlight an old issue and exposed how little societies have advanced since the first sexual harassment law was enacted. The maritime sectors are not free from this criticism with a number of aggravating factors. First, there has not been a separate discussion from the general one on sexual harassment on board. Second, this discussion is necessary in light of the work environment in which it takes place, on board a ship, and the fact that maritime professions are male-dominated. Third, enforcement of laws and policies in these matters is weak in view of the (potentially) different laws to which social aspects on board might be submitted. This paper analyses the already existing mechanisms to combat sexual harassment from a socio-legal perspective and argues that a tailor-made approach to this damaging problem is necessary. The traditional reluctance of maritime professionals to report any issues on board is aggravated in the case of sexual harassment, thereby a zero-tolerance policy has to be strongly asserted in order to realize a work environment free from discrimination, and enhance the effective recruitment and retention of women seafarers.",2020-07-01,Journal,Article,Marine Policy,27851,15,117,Sexual harassment and women seafarers: The role of laws and policies to ensure occupational safety & health,1,true,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103938,Elsevier Ltd,,2020.0,57.0,1.0,,646,2093050674,L.

648,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Young people with substance use problems face a high risk of co-occurring mental health problems, something that may involve a more difficult life situation, social problems as well as worse treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to analyse self-reported mental health problems among young people receiving outpatient treatment for substance use problems in Sweden. We explore what types of mental health problems are more or less predominant, and whether there are significant differences between boys and girls. In addition, we analyse how various mental health problems covary with indicators of substance abuse severity. Methods: The study is based on structured interviews with 1970 young people enrolled at outpatient clinics in 11 Swedish cities. The data was analysed through frequency- and averages-calculations, Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Self-reported mental health problems were common among the young people in the study. A relatively large percentage of the total group (34-54%) reported problems such as concentration difficulties, sleeping difficulties, anxiety and depression. At the same time, many of the young people did not report any symptoms and only a small group, about 20%, reported diagnosed mental health disorders. The results show substantial gender differences, with girls reporting significantly higher levels of mental health problems. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between severity of drug use problems and anxiety, concentration difficulties, aggression, hallucinations and mental stress caused by experiences of trauma. Conclusions: Treatment needs are diverse within this group of young people who use drugs. Since girls report higher levels of all mental health problems, and a larger burden of psychosocial risk factors than boys, they are likely to require more comprehensive treatment interventions. The link between more severe drug problems and mental health problems points to the importance of exploring this relationship in treatment.

The risk factors for PTB are complex and include maternal nutritional status and infections. This study aimed to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for targeted interventions to reduce the occurrence of PTB in Rwanda. Methods: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of healthy pregnant women aged 18 to 49 years. Women at 9-15 gestational weeks were recruited from 10 health centers in Gasabo District, Kigali Province between September and October 2017. Pregnancy age was estimated using ultrasonography and date of last menstruation. Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were performed using standard procedures for both mothers and newborns. Surveys were administered to assess demographic and health histories. Categorical and continuous variables were depicted as proportions and means, respectively. Variables with p < 0.25 in bivariate analyses were included in multivariable logistic regression models to determine independent predictors of PTB. The results were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results: Among 367 participants who delivered at a mean of 38.0 ± 2.2 gestational weeks, the overall PTB rate was 10.1%. After adjusting for potential confounders, we identified the following independent risk factors for PTB: anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dl) (OR: 4.27; 95%CI: 1.85-9.85), urinary tract infection (UTI) (OR:9.82; 95%CI: 3.88-24.83), chlamydia infection (OR: 2.79; 95%CI: 1.17-6.63), inadequate minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) score (OR:3.94; CI: 1.57-9.91) and low mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 23 cm (OR: 3.12, 95%CI; 1.31-7.43). indicators of nutritional inadequacy (low MDD-W and MUAC) predicted risk for low birth weight (LBW) but only UTI was associated with LBW in contrast with PTB. Conclusion: Targeted interventions are needed to improve the nutritional status of pregnant women, such as maternal education on dietary diversity and prevention of anemia pre-pregnancy. Additionally, prevention and treatment of maternal infections, especially sexually transmitted infections and UTIs should be reinforced during standard antenatal care screening which currently only includes HIV and syphilis testing.",2020-06-03,Journal,Article,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,12550,8,20,"Maternal genitourinary infections and poor nutritional status increase risk of preterm birth in Gasabo District, Rwanda: A prospective, longitudinal, cohort study",1,true,10.1186/s12884-020-03037-0,BioMed Central Ltd,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,2020.0,69.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Targeted interventions are needed to improve the nutritional status of pregnant women, such as maternal education on dietary diversity and prevention of anemia pre-pregnancy, as well as prevention and treatment of maternal infections.'}",650,11546714,E.

The current study used an online survey (n= 225: 169f, 55m, 1x, mean age 30.61 (SD 12.03)) to explore self-reported reactions to unsolicited explicit violent and sexual content that participants had received from friends or contacts. In line with our predictions based on previous studies of fictional explicit content, we found effects of both gender and prior exposure on these reactions. Specifically, females rated both sexual and violent explicit content as significantly less funny and exciting and more disturbing than males did. Amongst males, those with high previous exposure rated violent content as more exciting than those with lower or no prior experience. Regardless of gender, participants with higher exposure to sexual content rated it as funnier than those with mild or no exposure, and those with higher exposure to violent content rated it as more amusing and more exciting. However, contrary to what desensitization theories would predict, prior exposure did not attenuate how disturbing explicit content (of either a sexual or a violent nature) was rated.

However, few studies have investigated the mediators and moderators of the association between them. The current study aimed to build a conceptual model to estimate the mediating effect of emotional symptoms and the moderating effect of family support on this association among gay and bisexual men in Taiwan. A total of 500 gay or bisexual men were recruited for the study. Their history of homophobic bullying, their experience of sedative/hypnotic use, their perceived family support, and their current emotional symptoms were evaluated using self-reporting questionnaires. A moderated mediation model was developed to test the mediating effect of emotional symptoms and the moderating effect of family support. A higher level of homophobic bullying was significantly associated with sedative/hypnotic use among gay and bisexual men and this was mediated by a higher severity of emotional symptoms. A moderating effect of family support was identified, wherein the mediating effect of emotional symptoms was weaker when there was a higher level of perceived family support, thus revealing the protective effect of family support.

656,"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Two theories of intimate partner violence (IPV) have differing predictions on how women’s bargaining power affects rates of IPV. If an abuser enjoys and “pays” for IPV (expressive violence), bargaining power reduces rates of IPV. But if violence is a tool to increase bargaining power in the household (instrumental violence), a woman’s bargaining power may increase IPV. The existing evidence suggests that bargaining power decreases IPV on net. One way to reconcile these theories with the evidence is that both types of violence exist, and bargaining power especially reduces expressive violence. Using local variation in temperature, IPV police reports, and women’s labor market outcomes, we identify three key effects which together support this theory. First, we identify temperature-based violence as a type of expressive violence. Second, we find new evidence that a woman’s labor market opportunities shield her from IPV. Finally, we combine these analyses to show that a woman’s labor market opportunities specifically insulate her from temperature-based violence, providing evidence that bargaining power best protects women against expressive violence.",2020-06-01,Journal,Article,Review of Economics of the Household,144933,7,18,"The gender wage gap, weather, and intimate partner violence",2,,10.1007/s11150-020-09483-1,Springer,Review of Economics of the Household,2020.0,42.0,0.0,,656,2027151214,A.

657,"© 2020 American Journal of Preventive MedicineIntroduction: Suicidality is higher for gender minorities than the general population, yet little is known about suicidality in disabled or older adult gender minorities. Methods: This study used 2009–2014 Medicare claims to identify people with gender identity–related diagnosis codes (disabled, n=6,678; older adult, n=2,018) and compared their prevalence of suicidality with a 5% random non–gender minority beneficiary sample (disabled, n=535,801; older adult, n=1,700,008). Correlates of suicidality were assessed (via chi-square) for each of the 4 participant groups separately, and then disparities within eligibility status (disabled or older adult) were assessed using logistic regression models, adjusting first for age and mental health chronic conditions and then additionally for Medicaid eligibility, race/ethnicity, or U.S. region (each separately). The primary hypotheses were that gender minority beneficiaries would have higher suicidality but that suicidality disparities would persist after adjusting for covariates. Data were analyzed between 2017 and 2019. Results: Gender minority beneficiaries had higher unadjusted suicidality than non–gender minority beneficiaries in the disabled cohort (18.5% vs 7.1%, p<0.001). Significant suicidality predictors in all 4 groups included the following: age (except in older adult gender minorities), Medicaid eligibility, depression or behavioral health conditions, avoidable hospitalizations, and violence victimization. In age- and mental health–adjusted logistic regression models, gender minorities had higher odds of suicidality than non–gender minority beneficiaries (disabled, OR=1.95, p<0.0001; older adult, OR=2.10, p<0.0001).

658,"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.This research examines the decision-making factors and relationship repair strategies involved when social workers encounter concerns of potential child maltreatment. The purpose of this research is to determine the factors that influence social workers’ actions to maintain the therapeutic relationship following a report to Child Protection Services (CPS). Social workers from Ontario, Canada (n = 439) completed an online survey where they reviewed three vignettes of potential child maltreatment and responded to questions on how they would maintain the therapeutic relationship. A series of binary logistic regressions were completed to investigate the likelihood of taking specific actions to maintain the therapeutic relationship with their clients and the reasons for those actions. Factors associated with outcomes were used in the logistic regression analysis and included legal and ethical factors, clinician factors, situational factors, and professional factors. Overall, 75.6% of respondents indicated they would definitely report a child’s exposure to intimate partner violence, 49.2% would report physical maltreatment, and 66.1% would report emotional child maltreatment. In addition, a majority of respondents indicated that they would take further steps or action to maintain the therapeutic relationship with the family following the decision to report to CPS. Respondents would attempt a verbal connection with clients to restore the relationship; however, across all three vignettes, fewer respondents indicated that they would be willing to meet clients in their home. Occupational environment, social worker gender, and social worker comfort with discussing their concerns with caregivers were significant factors that influenced actions to maintain the therapeutic relationship. The research provides insight into the actions social workers would take to maintain therapeutic relationship with clients following the detection of child maltreatment.

The main aim of this study is to examine how type of family, friends, and school relationships, as well as the environment, are related to children’s subjective well-being (SWB). We use data from the International Survey of Children’s well-being for the analysis, which explores well-being through the perceptions and responses of children. We have performed bivariate analyses and applied multiple linear regression to examine the relational and contextual dimensions (family, friends, school and neighborhood) of children’s subjective well-being. We have taken the scale used by Russell as a measure of children’s subjective well-being since we consider it to be the most appropriate for comparing the satisfaction and happiness of children in different cultural contexts. The results show that gender, family structure, social relationships (family, friends and teachers) and neighborhood safety are significant correlates and predictors of SWB. The findings also show the relationship between variables such as friends, school, violence and SWB in the different countries, which could be related to the educational and welfare policies implemented by the different welfare states.",2020-06-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Happiness Studies,144820,11,21,"Children’s Relationships and Happiness: The Role of Family, Friends and the School in Four European Countries",0,false,10.1007/s10902-019-00160-4,Springereditorial@springerplus.com,Journal of Happiness Studies,2019.0,83.0,0.0,,659,2073713121,A.

660,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Reproductive coercion (RC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are prevalent forms of gender-based violence (GBV) associated with reduced female control over contraceptive use and subsequent unintended pregnancy. Although the World Health Organization has recommended the identification and support of GBV survivors within health services, few clinic-based models have been shown to reduce IPV or RC, particularly in low or middle-income countries (LMICs). To date, clinic-based GBV interventions have not been shown to reduce RC or unintended pregnancy in LMIC settings. Intervention: ARCHES (Addressing Reproductive Coercion in Health Settings) is a single-session, clinic-based model delivered within routine contraceptive counseling that has been demonstrated to reduce RC in the United States. ARCHES was adapted to the Kenyan context via a participatory process to reduce GBV and unintended pregnancy among women and girls seeking contraceptive services in this setting. Core elements of ARCHES include enhanced contraceptive counseling that addresses RC, opportunity for patient disclosure of RC and IPV (and subsequent warm referral to local services), and provision of a palm-sized educational booklet. Methods: A matched-pair cluster control trial is being conducted to assess whether the ARCHES intervention (treatment condition), as compared to standard-of-care contraceptive counseling (control condition), reduces RC and IPV, and improves contraceptive outcomes for woman and girls of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) seeking contraceptive services from community-based clinics in Nairobi, Kenya. All six clinics were assigned to intervention-control pairs based on similarities in patient volume and demographics, physical structure and neighborhood context. Survey data will be collected from patients immediately prior to their clinic visit (baseline, T1), immediately after their clinic visit (exit), and at 3- and 6-months post-visit (T2 and T3, respectively). Discussion: This study is the first to assess the efficacy of an adaptation of the ARCHES model to reduce GBV and improve reproductive health outside of the U.S., and one of only a small number of controlled trials to assess reductions in GBV associated with a clinic-based program in an LMIC context. Evidence from this trial will inform health system efforts to reduce GBV, and to enhance female contraceptive control and reproductive health in Kenya and globally.

662,"© 2020 The Author(s).This article focuses on policy and law concerning violence against women as a public health issue. In Sweden, violence against women is recently recognized as a public health problem; we label this shift ""The public health turn on violence against women"". The new framing implies increased demands on the Swedish healthcare sector and its' ability to recognise violence and deal with it in terms of prevention and interventions. The aim was to describe and discuss the main content and characteristics of Swedish healthcare law, and national public health and gender-equality policies representing the public health turn on violence against women. Through discursive policy analysis, we investigate how the violence is described, what is regarded to be the problem and what solutions and interventions that are suggested in order to solve the problem. Healthcare law articulates violence against women as an ordinary healthcare issue and the problem as shortcomings to provide good healthcare for victims, but without specifying what the problem or the legal obligation for the sector is. The public health problem is rather loosely defined, and suggested interventions are scarce and somewhat vague. The main recommendations for healthcare are to routinely ask patients about violence exposure. Violence against women is usually labelled ""violence within close relationships"" in the policies, and it is not necessarily described as a gender equality problem. While violence against women in some policy documents is clearly framed as a public health problem, such a framing is absent in others, or is transformed into a gender-neutral problem of violence within close relationships. It is not clearly articulated what the framing should lead to in terms of the healthcare sector's obligations, interventions and health promotions, apart from an ambivalent discourse on daring to ask about violence.",2020-05-24,Journal,Article,BMC Public Health,19621,8,20,"'The public health turn on violence against women': Analysing Swedish healthcare law, public health and gender-equality policies",1,true,10.1186/s12889-020-08766-7,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Public Health,2020.0,56.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The aim was to describe and discuss the main content and characteristics of Swedish healthcare law, and national public health and gender-equality policies representing the public health turn on violence against women, and what solutions and interventions that are suggested in order to solve the problem.'}",662,3986030,Ann Öhman,13967261,M.

We assessed the extent that binge-drinking behavior and the household role of the drinker were associated with alcohol-related domestic violence. Methods: We analyzed data from a nationally-representative census survey of 36,364 households in Thailand, of whom 17,759 households had one or more drinkers (n = 17,759 households). We aggregated the interview data of individuals living in the same households to create household-level attributes. We used multivariate log-binomial regression analyses to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) and measure the association between drinking behavior of household members and reported domestic violence during the previous 12 months. Results: Among households with one current drinker, households with a binge-drinker had higher prevalence of reported domestic violence than households where the drinker did not binge (Adjusted PR = 7.13; 95% CI = 4.79, 10.61), and households where the female head drank had significantly lower domestic violence compared to households where the male head drank (Adjusted PR = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.04, 0.33). Among households with two or more drinkers, households with one and two or more binge-drinkers had significantly higher prevalence of domestic violence compared to households with no binge-drinker (Adjusted PR = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.68, 4.86; and Adjusted PR = 4.62; 95% CI = 2.78, 7.67, respectively).

This community-based study examined the association between racial discrimination, sexual objectification and alcohol use in a sample of 369 gay and bisexual men of colour (Black/African/Caribbean, Latino/Latin American, South Asian, and East and Southeast Asian) in Toronto. Design: Data were drawn from an online survey designed to examine issues of racism, homophobia, health and well-being among gay and bisexual men of colour in Toronto. Regression analysis assessed the relationship between scores on the Racism and Life Experiences Scale, Sexual Objectification Scale, and the CAGE questionnaire (a screen for alcohol use disorder).

The possible effects of current developments in treatment philosophy emphasizing patientsˈ perspective and treatment involvement upon violence rate have not yet been examined. The aim of this paper is to analyse associations between such developments and the occurrence of violent incidents among patients in a high security forensic psychiatric ward. Methods: During a 17-year period with stable ward conditions, incidents of violence were systematically collected together with diagnostic, risk assessment and demographic patient characteristics. Changes in care- and organizational related variables such as nursing staff characteristics, treatment and management routines were collected. Multilevel modelling was applied to estimate the relationship between these variables and changes in violent incidents. Results: A substantial decline in the occurrence of violent incidents paralleled with changes in the ward during the middle phase of the study period.

This study investigates the association of selected factors (social, school performance and substance use) with physical fighting. A total of 2289 Romanian students were included in the 2007 database and 2770 in the 2011 database. This study revealed that 35.87% of the teenagers have taken part in a physical fight during the previous 12 months, as compared with the European average of 31.5%. Romania has the highest prevalence of violent behavior by participating in a group bruising of an individual in both surveys, 2007 and 2011. A logistic regression analysis performed for the 2011 study revealed the following factors associated with physical fighting: binge drinking during the previous 30 days, male gender, serious problems with friends, parent(s) who do not know where and with whom the adolescents spend their evenings, poor parental caring, low school grades, and high truancy.

I start from the premise that “race” is a set of relational practices rather than bounded “racial groups”. I operationalize this relational understanding of “race” methodologically by triangulating three measures of “race” – self-identified “census race”, interviewer-identified skin colour, and racial composition of the municipality – in conjunction with measures of class, gender and space. I find that whiter geographic spaces have lower overall levels of violent victimization, but that interviewer-identified darker-skinned individuals are disproportionately victimized in these whiter geographic spaces. Controlling for other variables, self-identified census race is not correlated with violent victimization.

The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence and correlates of lifetime CM use among a sample of young people in detention in Australia and to examine whether an association exists between lifetime CM use and recidivism in this population.The sample included 202 young people (164 males) in youth detention in the state of Victoria, Australia. Participants were administered questionnaires related to lifetime substance use and socioenvironmental experiences. Lifetime mental health data and offending data were obtained for each participant from public mental health and policing databases. More than one third (38%) of the sample reported lifetime CM use. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age, male gender, polysubstance use, and high levels of community disorganisation were associated with CM use. The presence of a psychiatric diagnosis over the lifetime was not significantly associated with CM use. CM use was also not significantly associated with violent recidivism. Efforts to address CM use and related harm in detained youth should include community-based strategies to reduce CM use among this vulnerable population following their release from detention.

670,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Interpersonal violence has increased as a health concern, especially in psychiatry practice, over the last decades. Nevertheless, most patients with stable mental disorders do not present an increased risk of violence, and mental disorder is not a necessary or sufficient cause of violent behaviours. People with mental disorders endorse more often a number of risk factors for violence that could confound this association, such as young age and male gender. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of age, gender, and diagnosis on reported levels of interpersonal violence in a sample of people with severe mental illness. Methods: The sample was composed of 160 inpatients: 73 with a psychosis within the schizophrenia spectrum, 53 with a mood disorder and 34 with a personality disorder. All patients enrolled in the study were assessed for experiences of victimization and perpetration of interpersonal violence using the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale interview. Demographic variables were also collected. Results: Both violence perpetration and victimization negatively correlated with age. Compared to males, females were exposed to higher degree of victimization in childhood and adulthood, whereas males were more involved in the perpetration of violence in childhood. Personality disorders were associated with higher levels of interpersonal violence, both perpetration and victimization; an interaction effect of gender and diagnosis was also observed for violence perpetration in adulthood. Distinct patterns of interpersonal violence did emerge for the diagnostic groups with mood disorder showing a victimization pattern, personality disorders a perpetration pattern and psychoses less defined patterns. Conclusions: The main finding is that psychotic disorders, mood disorders and personality disorders have different patterns of violent experiences interacting with age and gender. This study offers a better understanding of how gender and age could affect violent behaviours. Moreover, study findings may increase the comprehension of the reason why some mental disorders, compared to others, are more associated with the risk of victimization or perpetration of violence. These patterns could have pathophysiological or pathoplastic meaning addressing clinical and diagnostic trajectories and they could interact with other intervening risk factors.",2020-05-01,Journal,Article,BMC Psychiatry,14260,4,20,Cues for different diagnostic patterns of interpersonal violence in a psychiatric sample: An observational study,1,true,10.1186/s12888-020-02594-0,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Psychiatry,2019.0,60.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is found that psychotic disorders, mood disorders and personality disorders have different patterns of violent experiences interacting with age and gender, which may increase the comprehension of the reason why some mental disorders are more associated with the risk of victimization or perpetration of violence.'}",670,40085820,D.

However, possible correlates are still to be investigated after considering the history of criminal records and the experience of institutionalization.

674,"© The Author(s) 2020.Purpose: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth face risks for negative sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes; it is critical to provide these populations with health education that is both inclusive of and specific to their needs. We sought to characterize the strengths and weaknesses of SGM-related messages from web sites that address SRH for young people. We considered who is included, what topics are discussed, and how messages are framed. Methods: A systematic Google search and screening process was used to identify health promotion web sites with SRH content for adolescents and young adults. Using MAXQDA, we thematically coded and analyzed SGM content qualitatively. Results: Of 32 SRH web sites identified, 23 (71.9%) contained SGM content. Collectively, the sites included 318 unique SGM codes flagging this content. Approximately two-thirds of codes included messages that discussed SGM youth in aggregate (eg, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)—specific content about the diverse subpopulations within this umbrella term (eg, transgender youth) was more limited. In addition to SRH topics, most web sites had messages that addressed a broad array of other health issues including violence, mental health, and substance use (n = 17, 73.9%) and SGM-specific topics, for example coming out (n = 21, 91.3%). The former were often risk-framed, yet affirmational messages were common. Most web sites (n = 16; 69.6%) presented information for SGM youth both in stand-alone sections and integrated into broader content. Yet, integrated information was slightly more common (56.6% of all codes) than stand-alone content. Conclusions: Challenges of developing SRH content related to SGM youth include: (1) aggregate terms, which may not represent the nuances of sexual orientation and gender, (2) balancing risk versus affirmational messages, and (3) balancing stand-alone versus integrated content.

675,"© 2019, Springer Nature B.V.Medicine is a gendered discipline, in which women, both as patients and practitioners, have often held subordinate positions. The reproduction of dominant gender biases in the medical setting can negatively impact the professional development of medical students and the wellbeing of patients. In this analysis of medical students’ narratives of professionalism dilemmas, we explore students’ experiences of gender bias in hospital settings. Seventy-one students participated in 12 group interviews, where they discussed witnessing or participating in various activities that they thought were professionalism lapses. Within the dataset, 21 narratives had a distinctly gendered component broadly pertaining to patient dignity and safety dilemmas, informed consent issues, and female student abuse. Interestingly, perpetrators of such acts were commonly female healthcare professionals and educators. Although students recognized such acts as professionalism lapses and often expressed concern for patient wellbeing, students did not intervene or report such acts due to hierarchical cultural contexts, and at times even reproduced the discriminatory behavior they were criticizing. This raises concerns about medical students’ professionalism development and the extent to which gender bias is ingrained within particular medical systems. The normalization of disrespectful and abusive treatment of female patients poses immediate and future consequences to the wellbeing and safety of women. Furthermore, the same socio-cultural values that sustain these acts may account for perpetrators often being women themselves as they strive to overcome their subordinate position within medicine.",2020-05-01,Journal,Article,Advances in Health Sciences Education,26913,5,25,Female victims and female perpetrators: medical students’ narratives of gender dynamics and professionalism dilemmas,0,false,10.1007/s10459-019-09919-z,Springereditorial@springerplus.com,Advances in Health Sciences Education,2019.0,76.0,0.0,,675,23488093,M.

677,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Men's perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) limits gains in health and wellbeing for populations globally. Largely informal, rapidly expanding peri-urban settlements, with limited basic services such as electricity, have high prevalence rates of IPV. Evidence on how to reduce men's perpetration, change social norms and patriarchal attitudes within these settings is limited. Our cluster randomised controlled trial aimed to determine the effectiveness of the Sonke CHANGE intervention in reducing use of sexual and/or physical IPV and severity of perpetration by men aged 18-40 years over 2 years. Methodology: The theory-based intervention delivered activities to bolster community action, including door-to-door discussions, workshops, drawing on the CHANGE curriculum, and deploying community action teams over 18 months. In 2016 and 2018, we collected data from a cohort of men, recruited from 18 clusters; nine were randomised to receive the intervention, while the nine control clusters received no intervention. A self-administered questionnaire, using audio-computer assisted software, asked about sociodemographics, gender attitudes, mental health, and the use and severity of IPV. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis at the cluster level comparing the expected risk to observed risk of using IPV while controlling for baseline characteristics. A secondary analysis used latent classes (LCA) of men to see whether there were differential effects of the intervention for subgroups of men. Results: Of 2406 men recruited, 1458 (63%) were followed to 2 years. Overall, we saw a reduction in men's reports of physical, sexual and severe IPV from baseline to endpoint (40.2% to 25.4%, 31.8% to 15.8%, and 33.4% to 18.2%, respectively). Intention-to-treat analysis showed no measurable differences between intervention and control clusters for primary IPV outcomes. Difference in the cluster-level proportion of physical IPV perpetration was 0.002 (95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.07 to 0.08). Similarly, differences between arms for sexual IPV was 0.01 (95% CI - 0.04 to 0.06), while severe IPV followed a similar pattern (Diff = 0.01; 95% CI - 0.05 to 0.07). A secondary analysis using LCA suggests that among the men living in intervention communities, there was a greater reduction in IPV among less violent and more law abiding men than among more highly violent men, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: The intervention, when implemented in a peri-urban settlement, had limited effect in reducing IPV perpetrated by male residents. Further analysis showed it was unable to transform entrenched gender attitudes and use of IPV by those men who use the most violence, but the intervention showed promise for men who use violence less.

Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study involving a sample of 130 subjects, randomly selected through non-probabilistic sampling by quotas, in Spain and Peru (53 men and 77 women). An evaluation of violent intimate partner relationships was undertaken using a tool known as the ""Traffic Light of Gender Violence"". Results: Significant association was found between countries and the items related to the control of dress and outings, punishment by indifference, jealousy, overprotection and control by means of the mobile phone. On the other hand, formal education generates a decrease in gender violence suffered in women. With regard to age, males between 25 and 30 years of age show a significant increase in verbal violence and sexual coercion. Conclusion: Cultural and traditional rules can affect intimate partner violence. Therefore, they should be considered when educating for equality in order to elaborate new social constructs, focusing particularly on women with low levels of formal education (because they are more vulnerable to gender violence) and on men of the age group that tends to use it more.",2020-04-01,Journal,Article,Enfermeria Global,21100202145,0,19,Study of cultural differences in violent intimate partner relationships in Spain and Peru,1,true,10.6018/eglobal.364641,"Universidad de Murcia Servicio de PublicacionesC/ Actor Isidoro Maiquez, 9.Murcia30007",,2020.0,0.0,0.0,,679,2127501834,Juan Francisco Rubio Laborda,2127472365,Pilar Almansa Martínez,2127499261,José Vicente Navarro Henarejos,2126254128,María del Mar Pastor Bravo,,,,,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,Psychology

In Ghana, responding to and preventing sexual violence on university campuses, has become a priority area. However, data are lacking on the healthcare provider response to students who have experienced sexual violence. The purpose of this study was to conduct a situational analysis to better understand the healthcare provider response to sexual violence in Cape Coast, Ghana. Methods First, an observational facility assessment about healthcare services for survivors of sexual violence was conducted at two hospitals serving university students in Cape Coast, Ghana. Next, healthcare providers at the two hospitals completed: 1) a 113-item questionnaire about healthcare services, knowledge, and attitudes related to sexual violence and 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews describing their experiences providing healthcare to survivors of sexual violence. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were computed, and thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Results Both sites lacked supplies, including pre-packed rape kits, post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, and informational handouts on medications and support services for survivors. Further, healthcare providers lacked training on gender-based violence, including best practices for caring for survivors and evidence collection procedures. Providers described the clinical management for survivors of sexual violence, including providers’ role in reporting sexual violence to authorities, medical forensic exams, reproductive and sexual health services, and referral for mental healthcare. Finally, providers described a number of barriers to survivors accessing post-assault healthcare, including stigma and structural barriers, such as cost of medical supplies and lack of privacy within the healthcare facilities. Conclusions The current healthcare response to sexual violence in Ghana is limited by lack of supplies, knowledge, and training for healthcare providers.

Published by Oxford University Press in association with The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Domestic violence (DV) against women is a widespread violation of human rights. Adoption of effective interventions to address DV by health systems may fail if there is no readiness among organizations, institutions, providers and communities. There is, however, a research gap in our understanding of health systems' readiness to respond to DV. This article describes the use of a health system's readiness assessment to identify system obstacles to enable successful implementation of a primary health-care (PHC) intervention to address DV in the occupied Palestinian Territory (oPT). This article describes a case study where qualitative methods were used, namely 23 interviews with PHC providers and key informants, one stakeholder meeting with 19 stakeholders, two health facility observations and a document review of legal and policy materials on DV in oPT. We present data on seven dimensions of health systems. Our findings highlight the partial readiness of health systems and services to adopt a new DV intervention. Gaps were identified in: governance (no DV legislation), financial resources (no public funding and limited staff and infrastructure) and information systems (no uniform system), co-ordination (disjointed referral network) and to some extent around the values system (tension between patriarchal views on DV and more gender equal norms). Additional service-level barriers included unclear leadership structure at district level, uncertain roles for front-line staff, limited staff protection and the lack of a private space for identification and counselling. Findings also pointed to concrete actions in each system dimension that were important for effective delivery. This is the first study to use an adapted framework to assess health system readiness (HSR) for implementing an intervention to address DV in low- and middle-income countries.

685,"© The Author(s) 2017.In response to the high rates of intimate partner abuse (IPA) among young adults and related negative health effects, this study examined 18- to 26-year-old Australians’ perceptions of unhealthy partner behaviors that may constitute early warning signs of abuse in intimate relationships. This research is the first to examine gender differences on this issue in a young adult population. A convenience sample of 49 males and 152 females (N = 201) completed an online survey, rating how seriously they viewed a list of partner warning sign behaviors (WSBs). WSBs consisted of three subscales: Dominance-Possessiveness, Denigration, and Conflict-Retaliation. Participants’ perceived seriousness of WSBs was analyzed by gender and WSB type. Results revealed large and significant gender differences in perceptions of WSBs, with females likely to rate all WSBs more seriously than males. Furthermore, females’ responses were negatively skewed and leptokurtotic indicating high levels of convergence in the view that such behaviors are a concern. Analysis by WSB type revealed that conflict-retaliation behaviors were perceived most seriously by both genders, with more than half of males and 67% of females rating these as very serious. In contrast, significantly lower levels of perceived seriousness were observed for denigration and dominance-possessiveness behaviors. Half to two thirds of females viewed dominance-possessiveness and denigration WSBs as very serious, respectively, whereas just one third of males endorsed both these WSB types as very serious. Findings reveal that females have a heightened awareness of the subtle warning signs of abuse in intimate relationships and that as partner WSBs become more overt, both genders are more likely to recognize them as serious. Findings also indicate that subtler WSBs, such as control and denigration, are less readily identified as unhealthy, particularly among males.",2020-04-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,3,35,Warning Signs of Partner Abuse in Intimate Relationships: Gender Differences in Young Adults’ Perceptions of Seriousness,2,,10.1177/0886260517696869,SAGE Publications Inc.claims@sagepub.com,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2020.0,57.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Examination of 18- to 26-year-old Australians’ perceptions of unhealthy partner behaviors reveals that females have a heightened awareness of the subtle warning signs of abuse in intimate relationships and that as partner WSBs become more overt, both genders are more likely to recognize them as serious.'}",685,2131750954,A.

Recent scholarship has addressed the neglected structural dimension when examining the incidence and variation of post-conflict gender-based violence. In particular, continuum of violence and feminist political economy perspectives have offered accounts of gender-based violence during and after conflict. However, these approaches overlook how war and post-war economic processes interact over time and co-constitute the material basis for the continuation of gender-based violence. The war and post-war political economy perspective that we leverage examines critically the distinction, both in theory and practice, between global and local dynamics, and between formal and informal actors in post-conflict societies. Exposing these neglected structural and historical interconnections with evidence from post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina, we demonstrate that the material basis of gender-based violence is a cumulative result of political and socio-economic dynamics along the war-to-peace trajectory.

689,"© 2019 American Journal of Preventive MedicineIntroduction: This study analyzed the associations among male adolescents’ gender attitudes, intentions to intervene, witnessing peers’ abusive behaviors, and multiple forms of adolescent violence perpetration. This community-based evaluation aims to inform future youth violence prevention efforts through the identification of potential predictors of interpersonal violence perpetration. Methods: Cross-sectional data were from baseline surveys conducted with 866 male adolescents, aged 13–19 years, from community settings in 20 lower-resource neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA (August 2015 – June 2017), as part of a cluster RCT to evaluate a sexual violence prevention program. Participants completed in-person, anonymous electronic surveys about gender attitudes, bystander intentions, witnessing peers’ abusive behaviors, violence perpetration, and demographics. The analysis was conducted between 2018 and 2019. Results: The youth identified mostly as African American (70%) or Hispanic, multiracial, or other (21%). Most (88%) were born in the U.S., and 85% were in school. Youth with more equitable gender attitudes had lower odds of self-reported violence perpetration across multiple domains, including dating abuse (AOR=0.46, 95% CI=0.29, 0.72) and sexual harassment (AOR=0.50, 95% CI=0.37, 0.67). The relationship between intentions to intervene and violence perpetration was inconclusive. Witnessing peers engaged in abusive behaviors was associated with increased odds of multiple types of violence perpetration, such as dating abuse (witnessed 3 or more behaviors, AOR=2.41, 95% CI=1.31, 4.44). Conclusions: This is the first U.S.-based study to elicit information from male adolescents in community-based settings (rather than schools or clinics) about multiple types of interpersonal violence perpetration.

691,"© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.Background: Despite considerable achievements associated with the MDGs, under-five mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, remains alarmingly high. Globally, intimate partner violence (IPV) affects one in three women within their lifetime. Little is known about the relationship between IPV and maternal care-seeking in the context of high rates of under-five mortality, particularly among young women and adolescent girls in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: Data from the Kenya Demographic Health Survey (2008–2009) were limited to a sample of women aged 15–24 years (n = 1406) with a child under-five who had experienced IPV in the last 12 months. Using multivariate logistic regression, we constructed three models: (1) base model, (2) controlling for type of residence (urban/rural), and (3) controlling for wealth status and education attainment, to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the association between IPV and 10 maternal care-seeking behaviors. Results: Thirty-eight percent of the women had experienced some form of intimate partner violence in the last 12 months. Women who had experience IPV were less likely (1) to complete a minimum of four antenatal visits after single IPV exposure (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44, 0.86) and after severe IPV (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.44, 0.88) and (2) to deliver in health facility after severe IPV exposure (OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.54, 0.89), both adjusted for educational attainment and wealth status. Lower socioeconomic status and living in a rural area were strongly associated with increased likelihood of IPV. Conclusions: Intersectional approaches that consciously focus on and creatively address IPV may be key to the success of reducing child mortality and improving maternal health outcomes.

694,"© 2020, The Author(s).Social neurodevelopmental imbalance models posit that peer presence causes heightened adolescent risk-taking particularly during early adolescence. Evolutionary theory suggests that these effects would be most pronounced in males. However, the small but growing number of experimental studies on peer presence effects in adolescent risky decision-making showed mixed findings, and the vast majority of such studies did not test for the above-described gender and adolescent phase moderation effects. Moreover, most of those studies did not assess the criterion validity of the employed risky decision-making tasks. The current study was designed to investigate the abovementioned hypotheses among a sample of 327 ethnically-diverse Dutch early and mid-adolescents (49.80% female; Mage = 13.61). No main effect of peer presence on the employed risky-decision making task (i.e., the stoplight game) was found. However, the results showed a gender by peer presence moderation effect. Namely, whereas boys and girls engaged in equal levels of risks when they completed the stoplight game alone, boys engaged in more risk-taking than girls when they completed this task together with two same-sex peers. In contrast, adolescent phase did not moderate peer presence effects on risk-taking. Finally, the results showed that performance on the stoplight game predicted self-reported real-world risky traffic behavior, alcohol use and delinquency. Taken together, using a validated task, the present findings demonstrate that individual differences (i.e., gender) can determine whether the social environment (i.e., peer presence) affect risk-taking in early- and mid-adolescents. The finding that performance on a laboratory risky decision-making task can perhaps help identify adolescents that are vulnerable to diverse types of heightened risk behaviors is an important finding for science as well as prevention and intervention efforts.",2020-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,25680,8,49,Is the Peer Presence Effect on Heightened Adolescent Risky Decision-Making only Present in Males?,1,true,10.1007/s10964-019-01179-9,Springer,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,2019.0,0.0,0.0,,694,6214586,I.

695,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdObjective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictors of the transition from nonuse of alcohol to the first use of alcohol and the first episode of binge drinking. Methods: Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial conducted with seventh- and eighth-grade students from 72 public schools over a 21-month period in six cities in Brazil. A total of 3298 students who reported that they had never consumed alcoholic beverages and had never engaged in binge drinking at baseline were included in this study. The two binary outcomes were tested concomitantly via structural equation modeling. Maximum likelihood estimates for logistic regression models were performed to evaluate how baseline data regarding risk factors, such as sociodemographic characteristics (socioeconomic status, gender, and age), school experiences (violence and perception of academic performance), and social variables (family and friends), affected the initiation of alcohol use and binge drinking at 9- and 21-month follow-up assessments. Results: Older age, the perpetration of violent behaviors at baseline and the absence of the father living with the adolescent were predictors of both alcohol use initiation and binge drinking initiation.

Utilising a mixed methods approach, we designed templates to extract quantitative and qualitative data from DHRs. Descriptive statistics were generated by SPSS. 54 DHRs were analysed qualitatively, using N-Vivo for data management. The findings revealed that perpetrators were aged: 16–82 years; with a mean average age of 41 years. Victims’ ages ranged from 17 to 91 years old; with a mean average age: 45 years. Perpetrators’ mental health was mentioned in 65% of DHRs; 49% of perpetrators had a mental health diagnosis. Healthcare services, in particular, mental health services, were most likely to be involved with perpetrators. ‘Movement’ was identified as a key contextual feature of the 54 DHRs analysed qualitatively and this was found to interact with risk assessment, language barriers and housing problems.

A two-phase, mixed-method design study was conducted among university students from seven universities in Taiwan, aged 18 to 24 years. In Phase I, questionnaires used were specifically developed based on the TPB, consisting of both direct and indirect measures related to DV. In Phase II, questionnaire evaluation and related factors were examined through a two-step process of structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the TPB model. The results of this study found that perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and attitude toward DV on behavioral intention accounting for 37.5% of the total variance.

702,"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background: There is continued debate about whether sexualisation in games can influence sexist attitudes and reduced empathy towards women in real life. There is research evidence both supporting and refuting the possibility. Aims: Our aim was to examine the relationship between sexualised content in video games and players' sexist attitudes and empathy. Our research question was, do any such relationships exist once other factors including gender and trait aggression are controlled?. Methods: An online sample of 125 participants were recruited and asked to rate their video game playing experience, complete a trait aggression scale and record responses to a vignette about rape. Scores were first correlated, and then hierarchical multiple regression was employed followed by PROCESS examination of interactions between sexualised game content and trait aggression. Results: Exposure to sexualised content in video games was neither correlated with higher sexist attitude ratings nor with lower empathy scores. Sexualised content in games was associated with slightly lower sexist belief scores for those with higher scores on trait aggression (the 12.8% of our current sample at one standard deviation above the mean). No effects were observed for those low in trait aggression. Conclusions and Implications: While it is natural to be concerned about the impact of potentially arousing video games, actual effects may be counterintuitive, so if seeking to regulate, it is important to act from actual information.

703,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThis article examines how social movements reconceptualized trans-health in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Looking ethnographically to medical and activist practice, the article analyzes “epidemiological biographies”, or activist-produced community-based studies blending quantitative and narrative data. It draws on population health, feminist science studies, transgender studies, and social theory to discuss the circulation and implications of these publications. Specifically, it describes how epidemiological biographies disputed health behavioral models by defining state violence and criminalization as primary conditions endangering health and life expectancy among travestis and trans-people. The article analyzes how activist researchers made state violence legible through logics of population health, even as the concept of “population” also emerged from techniques of state control. In contrast with models that place individual behavior at the locus of health interventions, activists instead advanced interventions that contested state securitization and shifted resource distribution. Epidemiological biographies had a considerable effect on national trans-health politics, providing an evidentiary basis for several regulatory shifts. These studies emerged in part through collective political action that reformulated dominant modes of statistical aggregation. This statistical turn—which I call “statistical collectivization”—produced contradictory effects. At one level, it obscured differential conditions of criminalization and violence. At another, it directed attention to the markedly racialized, sexualized, classed, and gendered forms of subjugation that materialize in landscapes of trans-health, and prioritized materially distributive regulation over and above civil protections. Through these contradictory actions, social movements reformulated dominant notions of health by challenging state securitization and contesting state power.",2020-02-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,5,247,"Epidemiological rage: Population, biography, and state responsibility in trans- health activism",0,false,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112808,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2020.0,50.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This article describes how epidemiological biographies disputed health behavioral models by defining state violence and criminalization as primary conditions endangering health and life expectancy among travestis and trans-people in Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}",703,11431391,Christoph Hanssmann,,,,,,,,,,,12.0,127.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Medicine, Sociology"

However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal analyses to reveal a complete picture of the geographical and temporal patterns of crimes against women. We focus on analysing how the geographical pattern of ‘dowry deaths’ changes over time in the districts of Uttar Pradesh during the period 2001–2014. The study of the geographical distribution of dowry death incidence and its evolution over time aims to identify specific regions that exhibit high risks and to hypothesize on potential risk factors. We also look into different spatial priors and their effects on final risk estimates. Various priors for the hyperparameters are also reviewed. The risk estimates seem to be robust in terms of the spatial prior and hyperprior choices and final results highlight several districts with extreme risks of dowry death incidence.

705,"© 2019Background: Transgender women experience disproportionate social stigma that may lead to behavioral risks and poor psychological wellbeing. This study examines social and behavioral factors associated with binge drinking among transgender women in Cambodia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2016 among 1039 transgender women recruited from 13 provinces using the Respondent Driven Sampling method. A structured questionnaire was used for face-to-face interviews. Weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors associated with binge drinking. Results: The prevalence of binge drinking was 43.3 %. After adjustment, the odds of binge drinking were significantly higher among participants in the age group of 25–34 compared to those in the age group of 18–24 and lower among participants in job categories such as hairdresser or beautician, office workers, and self-employed compared to those who were unemployed. The odds of binge drinking were significantly higher in participants who dropped out of school and thought it was because of their transgender identity, had transactional sex in the past three months, used amphetamine-type stimulants in the past three months, and reported experience of verbal abuse by family members during childhood.

We examined differences between gender identities in self-reported health and related psychosocial variables, and compared TGD youth and their cisgender sexual minority peers from their cohort of origin on all variables. Among TGD youth, we found high rates of depression and suicidality (ideation, plan, attempt), violence (trauma, victimization, childhood sexual abuse), and substance use (cigarette, alcohol, illicit drug use). With the exception of depression, transgender women and non-binary AMAB youth reported worse health outcomes than transgender men and non-binary AFAB youth. Non-binary AMAB youth reported the highest rates of certain outcomes, including traumatic experiences and suicidal ideation.

711,"© Copyright © 2020 Garzón Segura and Carcedo González.Intimate partner violence, particularly against women, is widely studied owing to its high rates, based on transnational data. Colombia, where this form of violence is considerably common, is no exception, and such violence is occurring more and more often in increasingly younger couples (10−14 years old). Further, risk factors such as wide acceptance, the justification of intimate partner violence, extremely rigid traditional gender roles, and poor socio-emotional skills play a crucial role. In accordance with this reality, a gender-based intimate partner violence prevention program was designed, implemented, and evaluated for primary school children in Colombia based on a review of successful preventive programs and an identification of the main predictors of intimate partner violence. The program was evaluated using a quantitative study with a quasi-experimental design that included an experimental and a control group. In total, 344 participants were involved in the study: 195 boys (56.7%) and 149 girls (43.4%) from the second and third grades of a primary school (average age: 7.8 years) at a Colombian educational institution. The experimental group consisted of 200 participants and the control group of 144 participants. The program’s effectiveness was evaluated by measuring three groups of variables (gender stereotypes, the acceptance of violence, and socio-emotional skills) using reliable scales. To analyze the program’s effectiveness, mixed ANOVAs with a within-subjects factor (when the group was measured), two between-subjects factors (group and gender), and a covariate (age) were used. The results showed that the participants in the experimental group had lower scores in gender stereotypes, acceptance of peer aggression, and acceptance of physical violence against women compared to the control group. Conversely, they had higher scores in affective empathy after the intervention; both groups showed no significant differences before the intervention. This program is highly relevant because it has proven to have a positive impact on the participants and is innovative due to the lack of preventive programs that have been implemented in primary education and evaluated within the Colombian context.",2020-01-21,Journal,Article,Frontiers in Psychology,21100216571,5,10,Effectiveness of a Prevention Program for Gender-Based Intimate Partner Violence at a Colombian Primary School,1,true,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03012,Frontiers Media S.A.info@frontiersin.org,,2020.0,106.0,0.0,,711,2059973455,Anni Marcela Garzón Segura,2109142435,Rodrigo J.

712,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: In the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) programs targeting women are implemented. In the context of the 'Mawe Tatu' program more equitable intra-household decision-making is stipulated by accompanying women's participation in VSLAs with efforts to engage men for more gender equality, expecting a positive effect of this combined intervention on the household economy, on child nutritional status, on the use of reproductive health services including family planning, and on reducing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). Methods: A longitudinal parallel mixed method study is conducted among women participating in VSLAs in randomly selected project areas and among a control group matched for socioeconomic characteristics. Descriptive statistics will be calculated and differences between intervention and control groups will be assessed by Chi2 tests for different degrees of freedom for categorical data or by t-tests for continuous data. Structural equation modelling (SEM) will be conducted to investigate the complex and multidimensional pathways that will affect household economic status, child nutritional status and use of reproductive health services. Analysis will be conducted with STATA V.15. Concomitantly, qualitative data collection will shed light on the intra-household processes related to gender power-relations that may be linked to women's participation in economic activities and may lead to improvements of maternal and child health. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews will be conducted. All narrative data will be coded (open coding) with the help of qualitative data analysis software (Atlas TI). Discussion: Women's empowerment has long been identified as being able to bring about progress in various areas, including health.

714,"© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Violence exposure in adolescence is associated with a range of poor health and social outcomes, including both the perpetration and experience of violence in later intimate relationships. However, there is little longitudinal evidence on how both individual and contextual characteristics encourage or interrupt these associations. We designed the Contexts of Violence in Adolescence Cohort study (CoVAC) to provide evidence on these pathways for Ugandan adolescents, with the aim of providing information to improve the design of violence prevention interventions for adolescents and young adults. Methods: CoVAC is a mixed-methods prospective cohort study with three parallel strands. Between 2014 and 2022, the study comprises three waves of quantitative survey data collection; qualitative data from five time points; and a series of workshops to facilitate direct use of emerging findings by intervention developers at Uganda-based NGO Raising Voices in their ongoing work to prevent violence. 3431 adolescents participated in a survey in 2014 when the majority were aged 11-14 years, and agreed to be re-contacted for a Wave 2 survey in 2018 (aged about 15-18 years); and again in 2021 (aged 18-21 years). 36 young people from Wave 1 survey sample will be invited to participate in longitudinal qualitative data collection. Adolescents aged 18 years and over will provide informed consent; for those under age 18 years, adolescents will be invited to assent, except in cases where caregivers, following notification, have opted not to consent to their adolescent's participation. Quantitative and qualitative data will be analysed iteratively, and triangulation will be used to confirm, clarify and deepen our interpretation of findings. We will hold regular structured meetings so that emerging findings can be integrated into intervention development. Discussion: This will be the first longitudinal study on the aetiology of violence over adolescence in sub-Saharan Africa which will enable examination of pathways using mixed methods at multiple time points. Quantitative mediation analysis, and annual qualitative fieldwork will provide detailed insights into how adolescents' violence-related experiences, perspectives and practices relate to their social contexts and how these change over time. Results will feed directly into intervention development to reduce violence and harmful sequelae.

Aims: This study is conducted to identify nursing and midwifery students’ ability to recognise symptoms of violence against women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included nursing and midwifery students attending the Ege University, School of Nursing, the Celal Bayar University, Health School of Higher Education and Health School of Izmir Atatürk (N = 557). The convenience sampling method was used. There were 114 students who declined to participate in this study as they did not want to answer questions about violence (n = 443). Results: It was determined that 94.6% of the students were knowledgeable about violence against women. The scores obtained by students from the physical symptom sub-dimension were 8.35 ± 1.65 and from the emotional symptom sub-dimension were 11.97 ± 2.19.

She has been especially critical of much of Beethoven’s music, particularly the Ninth Symphony, which, along with other major works, she considers to be structured along patriarchal lines, actively if unconsciously promoting the values of patriarchy, overflowing with male violence and female subordination, its narrative primarily based on phallic sexuality. Her influence has been very considerable in musicology. I set out her case and critique it psychoanalytically, but in so doing I also set out my own theory of sonata form and Beethoven’s music as imbued with, and expressive of, a bisexual narrative. As Beethoven’s forceful masculinity has long been recognized, I particularly emphasize and illustrate his musical femininity.

FGM/C was considered a ‘rite of passage’ which was enforced to curb the expression of their sexuality and maintain social and gender norms within its communities. Nevertheless, attitudes towards FGM/C were changing among migrant populations. Conclusions: Creating community awareness projects, enforcing strict laws coupled with increasing health professional involvement may reduce the incidence of FGM/C.",2020-01-02,Journal,Article,International Journal of Sexual Health,7100153131,1,32,Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Systematic Review and Meta-Ethnography Exploring Women’s Views of Why It Exists and Persists,2,,10.1080/19317611.2019.1683115,Routledgeaabs@uw.edu,International Journal of Sexual Health,2020.0,60.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Creating community awareness projects, enforcing strict laws coupled with increasing health professional involvement may reduce the incidence of FGM/C.'}",718,123557912,Wafa Elamin,1393652488,A.

In conjunction with a structural violence framework, I draw on the work of historian Marisa Fuentes to consider violence within archives. Fuentes (Dispossessed Lives: Enslaved Women, Violence, and the Archive 2016: 16) introduces the concept of “mutilated historicity,” or “the violent condition in which enslaved women appear in the archive disfigured and violated.” Violence committed on bodies permeates the material record; here I consider the many forms such violence can take, including within historical accounts. At the same time, I also conceive of the archive more broadly and more insightful when “the body in the archive” and “the material body” are integrated.

Analysis of gender differences in attribution of guilt to the aggressor and the victim of spousal violence, depending on the victim' and the aggressor' gender. Background. Studies of spousal aggression show that a man's aggression towards a woman is perceived as typical aggression, attribution of guilt to the victim-wife is directly related to the faith in a just world and the aggressor-husband is attributed more guilt than the aggressor-wife. The connection of the attribution of guilt to the victim-husband with faith in a just world and the correlation between the attribution of guilt to the victim-husband and the attribution of guilt to the victim-wife, depending on the gender of the respondents, has not been sufficiently studied. Study design. We evaluated 1) correlation of attribution of guilt to participants in a typical and atypical situation of violence through the sample as a whole and separately for men and women, and 2) differences in the level of attribution of guilt to participants in their own and opposite gender group using the method of variance analysis. Participants. 1,157 people, including 679 women, aged 18 to 66. Measurements.

Results. The attribution of guilt to the victim-wife is directly related to faith in a just world only among women; the connection of the victim-wife's guilt with faith in a just world is reversed among men.

730,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Little is known about women who have experienced a recent rape, and how they differ from women without this exposure. Identifying factors linked to rape is important for preventing rape and developing effective responses in countries like South Africa with high levels of sexual violence. Objective: To describe the socio-demographic and health profile of women recently exposed to rape and to compare them with a non-rape-exposed group. Methods: The Rape Impact Cohort Evaluation Study (RICE) enrolled 852 women age 16–40 years exposed to rape from post-rape care centres in Durban (South Africa) and a control group of 853 women of the same age range who have never been exposed to rape recruited from public health services. Descriptive analyses include logistic regression modelling of socio-demographic characteristics associated with recent rape exposure. Results: Women with recent rape reported poorer health and more intimate partner violence than those who were not raped. They had a lower likelihood of having completed school (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.46 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.24–0.87) and dependence on a government grant as a main source of income (OR 0.61: 95%CI 0.49–0.77). They were more likely to live in informal housing (OR 1.88 95%CI: 1.43–2.46) or rural areas (OR 2.24: 95%CI 1.61–3.07) than formal housing areas–however they were also more likely to report full-time employment (OR 4.24: 95%CI 2.73–6.57). Conclusion: The study shows that structural factors, such as lower levels of education, poverty, and living in areas of poor infrastructure are associated with women’s vulnerability to rape. It also shows possible protection from rape afforded by the national financial safety net. It highlights the importance of safe transportation in commuting to work.

Given pervasive health disparities among underserved populations, understanding how ACEs are associated with substance use among urban Emergency Department (ED) patients could help inform design of effective screening, brief interventions, and referral to treatment. Objectives: To estimate gender differences in prevalence of separate and cumulative ACEs among a sample of urban ED patients, and assess its association with at-risk drinking (4+/5+ drinks for females/males), cannabis, and illicit drug use. We hypothesized that the association between ACEs and each outcome would be stronger among females than males. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data were obtained from 1,037 married/partnered ED patients (53% female) at a public safety-net hospital. Gender-stratified logistic regression models were estimated for each substance use outcome. Results: One+ ACEs were reported by 53% of males and 60% of females. Females whose mother was a victim of domestic violence had greater odds of at-risk drinking compared to females who did not report this ACE (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.03, 2.88).

734,"© Copyright 2020 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.Intimate partner violence (IPV) is regarded by key stakeholders involved in shaping arrest and intervention policies as a gendered problem. The prevailing assumptions guiding these policies, centered on patriarchal social structures and men's motivation to dominate their female partners, have collectively been called the gender paradigm. When states started to enact laws against domestic violence in the late 1970s, it was due to the efforts of battered women and their allies, including second wave feminists fighting for the political, social, and economic advancement of women. The focus was on life-threatening forms of abuse in which women represented, and continue to represent, the much larger share of victims. Since then, IPV has been found to be a more complex problem than originally framed, perpetrated by women as well as men, driven by an assortment of motives, and associated with distal and proximate risk factors that have little to do with gender. Nonetheless, the gender paradigm persists, with public policy lagging behind the empirical evidence. The author suggests some reasons why this is so, among them the much higher rates of violent crimes committed by men, media influence and cognitive biases, political factors, and perpetuation of the very sex-role stereotypes that feminists have sought to extinguish in every other social domain. He then critically reviews two theories used in support of the paradigm, sexual selection theory and social role theory, and explores how empirically driven policies would more effectively lower IPV rates in our communities, while advancing core feminist principles.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,Partner Abuse,19900191409,2,11,"Explaining Symmetry Across Sex in Intimate Partner Violence: Evolution, Gender Roles, and the Will to Harm",0,false,10.1891/PA-2020-0014,Springer Publishing Company,Partner Abuse,2020.0,0.0,1.0,,734,102923497,J.

737,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.Currently, most of the affective computing research is about modifying and adapting the machine behavior based on the human emotional state. Although, the use of the affective state inference can be extended to provide a tool for other fields more society related such as gender violence detection, which is a real global emergency. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, one in three women worldwide experiences gender-based violence, often from an intimate partner. Due to this motivation, the authors developed BINDI, which is a wearable solution for detecting automatically those situations. It uses affective computing together with short-term physiological and physical observations. It represents a step toward an autonomous, embedded, non-intrusive, and wearable system for detecting those situations and connecting the victim with a trusted circle.

738,"© 2020 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.So far, the psychotherapeutic treatment of patients with trauma spectrum disorders has most commonly been based on a disease model in which the normal reaction to trauma results in negative emotions, cognitions and behaviour which, in turn, cause a pathological state of mind or disorder. Here, trauma is associated with distress. This model focuses on identification, classification and treatment of the pathological and maladaptive modulations of the stress response that lead to psychological and social suffering and disability. In contrast to that, recent models in the Psychotherapy of the sequels of extreme life experiences, such as Positive Psychotherapy, have rather focussed on the building of competence, resilience and posttraumatic growth. In this article we summarise our experience in treating Yazidi women for their complex psychological traumata resulting from their experience of ISIS terror. We will use a short summary of published secondary data and reviews and use case examples from our work as primary data to discuss possible individual and collective resources that can help them to recover and to maintain a positive perspective on their person and the world, in spite of their terrible traumatic experiences. Original models of Positive Psychology already paid considerable attention to strength and resilience. The new approach of ‘second wave’ Positive Psychology expands on this, suggesting that negative emotions as well cultural factors must also be integrated. This approach appears to be particularly helpful in the treatment of this group of Yazidi women. Likewise, it seems to be promising when treating similar groups of people who survived extreme terror and were continuously exposed to genocidal environments.",2020-01-01,Journal,Review,International Review of Psychiatry,16203,3,32,Positive psychotherapy in the treatment of traumatised Yezidi survivors of sexualised violence and genocide,0,false,10.1080/09540261.2020.1809356,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,International Review of Psychiatry,2020.0,88.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The new approach of ‘second wave’ Positive Psychology expands on this, suggesting that negative emotions as well cultural factors must also be integrated, and this approach appears to be particularly helpful in the treatment of this group of Yazidi women.'}",738,49389752,J.

739,"© 2020 Universidad Nacional de Rosario - Facultad de Humanidades y Artes, Escuela de Historia. All rights reserved.In this article my proposal is to, in first instance, demonstrate that the enhancing process of the penitentiary system of the mid 70's, what the governing elites called “modernization of prison”, was compatible with an amplified utilization of violence. Hence, the penalty's administration of an increasing number of people being accused of committing political offences took part of a repressive system, each time more centralized. The “modernization of prison”, not only did not bring the decrease of state violence along, but also, in the contrary, brought a deepening in the heat of the rising social conflict. Specifically, the weft of the prison discipline, during the last military dictatorship, was obsessively tied to the idea of reforming the “subversives” with rigorous control techniques, requisite and restrictive regulations and penitentiary classifications. Along these lines and, in second instance, my proposal is to demonstrate that the “recovery treatments” included the gender dimension as a constituent element of disciplinary technology. The criminalization of gender and sexuality was used as a strategy to outrage male and female prisoners and to place them in the position of victims and not as political adversaries. Therefore, the bodies were transformed into spaces where power logics were written and settled and, at the same time, became an area of dispute over these attributions. The body of women and male political prisoners was delimited as an ostensible territory of which appropriation depended of the exercise of power, and despite the fact that the main objective of the regime was the ideological destruction, it was, in fact, consumed through the sex-gender system.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,Paginas,21100856605,0,11,The bodies as spaces of inscription of power: The experience of the political prison in Argentina during the 60's and 70's Los cuerpos como espacios de inscripción del poder: La experiencia de la prisión política en la Argentina durante los años sesenta y setenta,1,true,10.35305/RP.V11I27.365,"Universidad Nacional de Rosario - Facultad de Humanidades y Artes, Escuela de Historiapaginas@unr.edu.ar",,2019.0,0.0,0.0,,739,119147988,Débora D´Antonio,,,,,,,,,,,12.0,16.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Art
740,"Copyright © The Author(s), 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press.BackgroundThere is increasing evidence that domestic violence (DV) is an important risk factor for suicidal behaviour. The level of risk and its contribution to the overall burden of suicidal behaviour among men and women has not been quantified in South Asia. We carried out a large case-control study to examine the association between DV and self-poisoning in Sri Lanka.MethodsCases (N = 291) were patients aged 3/418 years, admitted to a tertiary hospital in Kandy Sri Lanka for self-poisoning. Sex and age frequency matched controls were recruited from the hospital's outpatient department (N = 490) and local population (N = 450). Exposure to DV was collected through the Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the association between DV and self-poisoning, and population attributable fractions were calculated.ResultsExposure to at least one type of DV within the previous 12 months was strongly associated with self-poisoning for women [adjusted OR (AOR) 4.08, 95% CI 1.60-4.78] and men (AOR 2.52, 95% CI 1.51-4.21), compared to those reporting no abuse. Among women, the association was strongest for physical violence (AOR 14.07, 95% CI 5.87-33.72), whereas among men, emotional abuse showed the highest risk (AOR 2.75, 95% CI 1.57-4.82). PAF% for exposure to at least one type of DV was 38% (95% CI 32-43) in women and 22% (95% CI 14-29) in men.ConclusionsMulti-sectoral interventions to address DV including enhanced identification in health care settings, community-based strategies, and integration of DV support and psychological services may substantially reduce suicidal behaviour in Sri Lanka.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,Psychological Medicine,18742,8,,Domestic violence and self-poisoning in Sri Lanka,2,,10.1017/S0033291720002986,Cambridge University Pressjournals_subscriptions@cup.cam.ac.uk,Psychological Medicine,2020.0,53.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Multi-sectoral interventions to address DV including enhanced identification in health care settings, community-based strategies, and integration of DV support and psychological services may substantially reduce suicidal behaviour in Sri Lanka.'}",740,151165113,Piumee Bandara,2064218701,Andrew Page,6983227,L.

741,"© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group, on behalf of the University of Witwatersrand.This article examines political violence enacted by youth during the presidential run-off election in Zimbabwe in 2008. After the presidential election in March 2008, no clear winner emerged, leading to a run-off election in June 2008 between Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). In the face of a possible defeat in the run-off, ZANU-PF unleashed significant levels of violence against MDC activists and members, such that Tsvangirai withdrew. Central to the violence were youths, and mainly young men, who performed this violence for diverse reasons, including promises of material rewards and compliance due to fear of being labelled as a sell-out. While not denying the significance of these reasons, this article explores the importance of political socialisation of youth in Zimbabwe by the ‘war generation’, that is, those who fought during the war of liberation in the 1970s. This socialisation entailed the propagation of an authoritarian nationalist narrative by ZANU-PF in which violence was justified in defending ‘the revolution’. This narrative was very pervasive in the years preceding 2008 and in the months leading up to the run-off. There is evidence that suggests that youths learnt about the efficacy of violence through this process of political socialisation and, on this basis, performed violence during the run-off. We conclude that this ‘indoctrination’ is of some significance in understanding youth violence in 2008. However, we argue that any youths considered as inspired on nationalist grounds to enact violence also had their own personal motivations that are irreducible to nationalist fervour.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,African Studies,18929,1,79,Learning and performing political violence: ZANU-PF Youth and the 2008 presidential run-off election in Zimbabwe,0,false,10.1080/00020184.2020.1821351,University of Witwatersrand,,2020.0,61.0,0.0,,741,102705979,Gift Mwonzora,103606887,Kirk Helliker,,,,,,,,,11.0,13.0,2.0,56.0,295.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science

Method: The sample consisted of 245 transgender adults receiving transgender-related health services at a public specialised clinic in Mexico City. Results: Findings are in line with the evidence in the literature and confirm that transgender people are at a high risk of different types of violence, with psychological violence being the most common, followed by physical and sexual violence. This occurs at an early age and in different contexts, mainly through social experiences with family members and school peers. Experiences of rejection, seeking to be treated as the gender identity and asking to be called by the name selected for gender identity were the most important predictors for all types of violence.

We asked the research questions: What were the family factors, dating attitudes, and risky behaviors associated with three subtypes of dating violence victimization across two time points? Second, were these relationships moderated by gender? Overall, we found widespread co-occurrence of victimization. Contrary to our predictions, not all earlier experiences with dating violence victimization worsened or persisted overtime. Regarding family factors, we did not find substantial statistically significant effects on victimization, with the exception that greater openness with parents was associated with increased occurrence of emotional abuse at Wave 1. In terms of dating attitudes, we found that when respondents condoned violence against a girlfriend, they were more likely to experience physical violence victimization at both waves. Respondents who believed that it is okay to use violence to control a boyfriend's behavior were more likely to report emotional abuse at Wave 1. Similarly, respondents who believed that it is okay to date more than one person, as well as those who condoned sexual intercourse outside of a romantic relationship, were more susceptible to emotional abuse. Regarding risky behaviors, we found that the respondents' victimization experience did not increase with a greater sexual partner acquisition; rather, it exerted the opposite effect on their experience with physical violence victimization. These risky behaviors, however, were only statistically significant at Wave 1. Finally, the moderating effect of gender is noted in the study.

747,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.The effectiveness of batterer intervention programs (BIPs) in reducing rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been seriously questioned. Critics charge that these programs fail to meet the criteria for “evidence-based practice” because they rely on outdated gender-based models, are not always tailored to client needs, and limited by outdated state standards. Findings are presented from a broad overview of research on IPV and batterer intervention group programs in the general population and among ethnic minority and LGBTQ populations, as well as relevant research on general psychotherapy, self-help and group process research, with implications for improved treatment outcomes. A general framework for evidence-based treatment is proposed, based on Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) principles. An emphasis is placed on how front-line providers can find common ground across theoretical perspectives, and meet client needs, by combining clinical experience and client preferences with established empirical research findings. A sound psycho educational curriculum should address the criminogenic needs, or risk factors, common to all offenders, with emphasis on some factors over others, depending on the client population (e.g., misogyny and gender roles for patriarchal men, poor impulse control and inadequate relationship skills for clients whose violence is mostly expressive or situational).

750,"© Copyright 2020 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.The purpose of the current article was to examine beliefs and attitudes around partner violence within Muslim society in Israel. The study addressed three gender-asymmetrical aspects of such beliefs: reasons for violence (the belief that men hurt their female partners to control them, and the belief that women hurt their male partners to protect themselves); violent behavior (the belief that men, more than women, are violent in intimate relationships); and the outcomes of violence (the belief that women, more than men, are injured as a result of intimate violence). The study also examines the attitude toward the appropriate social response to the problem (the belief that men who use partner violence should be condemned more than women should). First, the study compares men and women's belief levels and relates these to the accumulating empirical knowledge. Then, the study examines the difference between men and women in the relationship between the beliefs, as well as the effects of this on prevailing attitudes. The study was based on a community sample of 420 Muslim students. The research findings indicate that the belief that men, more than women, use physical violence in intimate relationships was the strongest belief of those tested and it was stronger among women than among men. The findings also indicate that among both men and women, the behavioral aspect does not affect the tendency for condemnation.

751,"© 2020 Russsian Psychological Society.Background. Rape myths are usually described as a widely-accepted set of false beliefs and attitudes about victims and perpetrators of sexual assault. These beliefs serve to deny, downplay, or justify sexual violence that men commit against women. The Acceptance of Modern Myths about Sexual Aggression (AMMSA) scale assesses those stereotypical beliefs about sexual aggression in a more subtle way than traditional measurements of rape myths, which often use rather blatant wording. Objective. To develop a Russian version of the sixteen-item AMMSA scale. Design. Our design was non-experimental. Participants were recruited online. In total, data of 270 Russian female participants and 131 German female participants were analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed using correlational analyses with other constructs that are believed to be related to AMMSA to different degrees (hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, traditional gender role preferences, and impression management). Results. It was found that the Russian AMMSA, just like the German AMMSA, was unidimensional, normally distributed, had high internal consistency, and showed good construct validity. Conclusion.

752,"© 2020 Gram L et al.Background: A growing number of global health interventions involve community members in activism to prevent violence against women (VAW), but the psychological drivers of participation are presently ill-understood. We developed a new scale for measuring three proposed drivers of participation in collective action to address VAW in the context of urban informal settlements in Mumbai, India: perceived legitimacy, perceived efficacy, and collective action norms. Methods: We did a household survey of 1307 men, 1331 women, and 4 trans persons. We checked for 1) social desirability bias by comparing responses to self-administered and face-to-face interviews, 2) acquiescence bias by comparing responses to positive and negatively worded items on the same construct, 3) factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis, and 4) convergent validity by examining associations between construct scores and participation in groups to address VAW and intent to intervene in case of VAW. Results: Of the ten items, seven showed less than five percentage point difference in agreement rates between self-administered and face-to-face conditions. Correlations between opposite worded items on the same construct were negative (p<0.05), while correlations between similarly worded items were positive (p<0.001). A hierarchical factor structure showed adequate fit (Tucker-Lewis index, 0.920; root mean square error of approximation, 0.035; weighted root mean square residual, 1.952). Perceived legitimacy, efficacy and collective action norms all predicted participation in groups to address VAW and intent to intervene in case of VAW, even after adjusting for social capital (p<0.05). Conclusion: This is the first study to operationalize a measure of the psychological drivers of participation in collective action to address VAW in a low- and middle-income context.

A special category of gender-based violence is murder, the victim of which is the spouse or the former spouse of the person who committed the crime. In recent years this problem has been investigated by several researchers. The author defines the fundamental methodological bases and presents the results of international and foreign research on the issue of femicide. He represents the statistical indicators of the murders of intimate partners in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic. Due to the low rates of murder of females by their intimate partners (spouses) in the Slovak Republic and considering the elements of the crime of murder, the author comes to the conclusion that the situation in the Slovak Republic does not require a specific legislative solution to be applied in cases of murder of females committed by their intimate partners. The intimate partner's murder can be punished as a murder applying harsher sentences when there are aggravating circumstances in cases such as the killing of a protected person - a relative or committing this crime with a special motive - from hatred for gender, with imprisonment for twenty years to twenty-five years or for life imprisonment.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,Casopis pro Pravni Vedu a Praxi,21100920133,0,28,"Do we need a new crime - ""Femicide""?

756,"© 2020 Caetano et al.Introduction: Urban emergency departments (ED) provide care to populations with multiple health-related and overlapping risk factors, many of which are associated with intimate partner violence (IPV). We examine the 12-month rate of physical IPV and its association with multiple joint risk factors in an urban ED. Methods: Research assistants surveyed patients regarding IPV exposure, associated risk factors, and other sociodemographic features. The joint occurrence of seven risk factors was measured by a variable scored 0–7 with the following risk factors: depression; adverse childhood experiences; drug use; impulsivity; post-traumatic stress disorder; at-risk drinking; and partner’s score on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. The survey (N = 1037) achieved an 87.5% participation rate. Results: About 23% of the sample reported an IPV event in the prior 12 months. Logistic regression showed that IPV risk increased in a stepwise fashion with the number of present risk factors, as follows: one risk factor (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] [3.09]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-6.50; p<.01); two risk factors (AOR [6.26]; 95% CI, 3.04-12.87; p<.01); three risk factors (AOR = 9.44; 95% CI, 4.44-20.08; p<.001); four to seven risk factors (AOR [18.62]; 95% CI, 9.00-38.52; p<001). Ordered logistic regression showed that IPV severity increased in a similar way, as follows: one risk factor (AOR [3.17]; 95% CI, 1.39-7.20; p<.01); two risk factors (AOR [6.73]; 95% CI, 3.04-14.90; p<.001); three risk factors (AOR [10.36]; 95%CI, 4.52-23.76; p<.001); four to seven risk factors (AOR [20.61]; 95% CI, 9.11-46.64; p<001).

Based on a survey in early 2012 among employees from all work areas of 89 of the total 112 correctional facilities in Switzerland resulting in a sample of 2,045 employees (response rate 48.5%), this study (a) analyzed whether victimization has an impact on correctional staff burnout, (b) tested the hypothetical mediating role of sense of security in the relationship between victimization and burnout, and (c) included gender and job characteristics because work experiences and exposure to violence of staff differ strongly with gender and work tasks. Two different forms of violence were considered: (a) experienced violence (inmates-on-staff) and (b) observed violence (inmate-on-inmate). Analysis was carried out using structural equation modeling. Results show that victimization and witnessing violence between inmates negatively affect the personal sense of security and increase correctional staff burnout. In addition, the sense of security mediated the effect from experienced and observed violence on burnout. Gender and job characteristics also proved to be important. This is especially true for staff working as correctional officers and for employees working with young inmates and with inmates awaiting trial who reported a greater exposure to violence and a lower sense of security.

Drawing on concepts of boundary actors and boundary objects, we examined how interactions between clinicians and patients changed after the introduction of the IRIS programme. The referral pathway emerged as a boundary object, meeting a shared ambition of general practitioners and patients to distribute responsibility for addressing DVA.

761,"© 2019 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.Importance: Childhood stress exposure is associated with inflammation as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, findings are inconsistent and effect sizes are small. The addition of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a new biomarker of chronic inflammation, may improve measurement of stress-related inflammatory burden. Objectives: To assess whether exposure to adverse experiences, stress, and violence is associated with an increase in suPAR levels in young people and to test the hypothesis that measuring suPAR in addition to CRP or IL-6 levels improves the assessment of the inflammatory burden associated with early-life stress. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 1391 participants from a 1994 to 1995 birth cohort of twins from the nationally representative Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study in the United Kingdom. Participants were followed up until 18 years of age (93% retention). Plasma samples were analyzed in July 2018, and statistical analysis was performed from October 1, 2018, to May 31, 2019. Exposures: Adverse childhood experiences and childhood and adolescent experience of stress and violence exposure. Main Outcomes and Measures: Plasma CRP, IL-6, and suPAR levels at 18 years of age. Results: Among 1391 young people (mean [SD] age, 18.4 [0.36] years; 733 [52.7%] female), those who had been exposed to stressful experiences had elevated suPAR levels by 18 years of age after controlling for sex, body mass index, and smoking: 0.03-ng/mL (95% CI, 0.01-0.05 ng/mL) increase in suPAR per each additional adverse childhood experience, 0.09-ng/mL (95% CI, 0.01-0.17 ng/mL) increase in suPAR per each additional severe childhood experience of stress or violence, and 0.04-ng/mL (95% CI, -0.02 to 0.10 ng/mL) increase in suPAR per each additional severe adolescent experience of stress or violence. Individuals exposed to multiple types of violence in both childhood and adolescence had 0.26-ng/mL (95% CI, 0.07-0.45 ng/mL) higher suPAR levels compared with children who did not experience stress or violence. These stress-exposed young people were significantly more likely to have elevated suPAR levels at 18 years of age even if they did not have elevated CRP or IL-6 levels. Measuring suPAR in addition to CRP or IL-6 increased the association between stress exposure and inflammatory burden. For example, after adjusting for CRP and IL-6 levels, each additional adverse childhood experience was associated with a 0.05-mL (95% CI, 0.03-0.07 ng/mL) increase in suPAR, each additional severe childhood experience of stress or violence was associated with a 0.14-ng/mL (95% CI, 0.06-0.22 ng/mL) increase in suPAR, and each additional severe adolescent experience of stress or violence was associated with a 0.10-ng/mL (95% CI, 0.04-0.16 ng/mL) increase in suPAR.

The interaction processes through which women are objectified, however, have rarely been considered. To address this gap in the literature, we propose the Social Interaction Model of Objectification (SIMO). Rooted in social exchange and objectification theories, the SIMO predicts objectifying behaviours stemming from sexual goals between men and women. We propose that the behavioural dynamics of objectification can be understood through a series of goal-based exchange processes that are shaped by patriarchy. Articulating the SIMO and its predictions for behaviour in social interactions, we describe the scant social psychological studies in this area. Not only is the SIMO useful for understanding objectifying interaction processes, but it can be used to understand why women sometimes evaluate objectification positively as well as instances of sexual violence.

The exclusion criterion was to be absent from work by any kind type license during the period of data production. Method: The technique used to produce data was individual, semi-structured, interviews in order to collect sociodemographic data and the monitoring by professionals related to the potentials and limitations to identify violence situations. The data collection was suspended based on the saturation criterion. The data were systematized and analyzed by the content analysis technique, according to the analytical categories of health care network and gender. Results: The potential to identify themes were: professional experience, receptive atmosphere, bonding, and listening to the reports of women, children and/or neighbors and observing their behavior; to identify the lesions; prenatal consultations; and home visits.

765,"© 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U.Introduction: Gender violence is a major public health problem that requires the intervention of health personnel, among others. Professionals indicate that lack of knowledge is one of the main difficulties of facing this problem. The attitudes and misperceptions among university students might be due to inadequate or insufficient training. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beliefs and attitudes towards gender violence among students of the University of Santiago de Compostela. Material and methods: A total of 491 undergraduate students (Medicine, Nursing, Criminology and Law) of the University of Santiago de Compostela completed an anonymous 30-item questionnaire. Results: Most (70.9%) participants in the survey were women, with a mean age of 22.7 years. Although 53.6% of students had received previous training, data show that they have some misperceptions on gender violence. Nearly 96% consider it as an important problem in our society, and believe that attention to the victims has to be improved. Almost 90% of respondents disagreed about considering it a private matter, supporting the legal complaint by health personnel. Conclusions: Data shows the necessity to offer more educational opportunities on gender violence, especially to students of those professions involved in this problem. An appropriate education of the future professionals would improve the detection and treatment of the victims.",2020-01-01,Journal,Article,Educacion Medica,5100152914,3,21,Beliefs and attitudes of university students towards gender violence Creencias y actitudes del alumnado universitario hacia la violencia de género,1,true,10.1016/j.edumed.2018.03.017,Elsevier Espana S.L.U,,2020.0,13.0,0.0,,765,122086594,Rebeca Diéguez Méndez,2085788092,I.

The extent of violence against nurses in Iran and the factors leading to this violence have not been known. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate all forms of violence against nurses in Shahrekord hospitals in 2014. In this 2014 study, 100 nurses working in Shahrekord’s Hajar, Kashani, and Social Security branch hospitals were studied. Data were collected through standardized questionnaires on workplace violence, as well as demographic data, in health units on five types of violence, including physical and verbal violence, intimidation and bullying, ethnic violence, and violation of chastity. The analysis was done by SPSS (Version 19) software. All nurses indicated that during some period of their work, they had been subjected to at least one type of violence; the highest prevalence of mental violence was belonged to the subtype of intimidation and bullying (91%). The primary agents of violence against nurses were patients and their relatives. Factors such as gender, age, work experience, and nursing shifts played important roles in the distribution of violence. In ethnic violence, the only factor affecting nurses was race (p <.05). The highest rate of violence against nurses was due to mental or psychological violence.

A total of 437 male and female heterosexual participants residing in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, provided information on their perpetration/victimization experiences of controlling behavior (by means of the Controlling Behaviors Scale) and physical violence (using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales [CTS2]) and their attitudes toward social limits (using the Attitudes Toward Social Limits scale). Results indicate similar chronicity levels of experienced controlling behavior and physical violence perpetration/victimization between the sexes. Participants expressed major tendency to adjust to a social norm rather than overstepping it. Males tend to overstep social limits more often than females, although no significant linear relationship was found between abusive behavior and attitudes promoting the infringement of social norms. Higher chronicity levels were rather found by dyadic type, relationships with mutual physical intimate partner violence (IPV), and controlling behavior in comparison with relationships where unidirectional violence prevails.

768,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: In a cluster randomised controlled trial in Mumbai slums, we will test the effects on the prevalence of violence against women and girls of community mobilisation through groups and individual volunteers. One in three women in India has survived physical or sexual violence, making it a major public health burden. Reviews recommend community mobilisation to address violence, but trial evidence is limited. Methods: Guided by a theory of change, we will compare 24 areas receiving support services, community group, and volunteer activities with 24 areas receiving support services only. These community mobilisation activities will be evaluated through a follow-up survey after 3 years. Primary outcomes will be prevalence in the preceding year of physical or sexual domestic violence, and prevalence of emotional or economic domestic violence, control, or neglect against women 15-49 years old. Secondary outcomes will describe disclosure of violence to support services, community tolerance of violence against women and girls, prevalence of non-partner sexual violence, and mental health and wellbeing. Intermediate theory-based outcomes will include bystander intervention, identification of and support for survivors of violence, changes described in programme participants, and changes in communities. Discussion: Systematic reviews of interventions to prevent violence against women and girls suggest that community mobilisation is a promising population-based intervention. Already implemented in other areas, our intervention has been developed over 16 years of programmatic experience and 2 years of formative research. Backed by public engagement and advocacy, our vision is of a replicable community-led intervention to address the public health burden of violence against women and girls.

769,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Evaluating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive (SRH) services requires an understanding of the health needs of individuals and what constitutes access to services. We explored women's costs of accessing SRH services in Johannesburg, South Africa and contextualized costs based on estimates of household income. Methods: We conducted an observational study of women aged 18-49 at a public HIV treatment site and two public primary health care facilities from June 2015 to August 2016. Interviews assessed women's SRH needs (for contraception, fertility problems, menstrual problems, menopause symptoms, sexually transmitted infections (STI), experiences of intimate-partner violence (IPV), and cervical and breast cancer screening) and associated costs. We calculated average and total costs (including out-of-pocket spending, lost income, and estimated value of time spent) for women who incurred costs. We also estimated the total and average costs of meeting all SRH needs in a hypothetical ""full needs met"" year. Finally, we contextualize SRH spending against a measure of catastrophic expenditure (> 10% of household income). Results: Among the 385 women who participated, 94.8% had at least one SRH need in the prior 12 months; 79.7% incurred costs for accessing care. On average, women spent $28.34 on SRH needs during the prior year. Excluding one HIV-negative woman who spent 112% of her annual income on infertility treatment, HIV-positive women spent more on average annually for SRH care than HIV-negative women. Sixty percent of women reported at least one unmet SRH need. If all participants sought care for all reported needs, their average annual cost would rise to $52.65 per woman. Only two women reported catastrophic expenditure - for managing infertility. Conclusions: SRH needs are constants throughout women's lives. Small annual costs can become large costs when considered cumulatively over time. As South Africa and other countries grapple with increasing access to SRH services under the rubric of universal access, it is important to remember that individuals incur costs despite free care at the point of service. Policies that address geographic proximity and service quality would be important for reducing costs and ensuring full access to SRH services. Plain English summary: Literature on women's financial and economic costs for accessing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care in low- and middle-income countries is extremely limited, and existing literature often overlooks out-of-pocket costs associated with travel, child care, and time spent accessing services. Using data from a survey of 385 women from a public HIV treatment site and two public primary health care facilities in Johannesburg, we found nearly all women reported at least on sexual and reproductive health need and more than 75% of women incurred costs related to those needs. Furthermore, more than half of women surveyed reported not accessing services for their sexual and reproductive health needs, suggesting a total annual cost of more than $50 USD, on average, to access services for all reported needs. While few women spent more than 10% of their total household income on sexual and reproductive health services in the prior year, needs are constant and costs incur throughout a woman's life suggesting accessing services to meet these needs might still result in financial burden. As South Africa grapples with increasing access to sexual and reproductive health services under the rubric of universal access, it is important to remember that individuals incur costs despite free care at the point of service.

775,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Transgender women have multiple disparities globally, including social rejection and stigma, HIV infection and untreated mental health problems. However, few data on transgender women are available in China. Therefore, this study aimed to explore transgender women's experiences on gender identity, disclosure, discrimination, transgender-specific medical care, and perceptions of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) risk in China. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in Nanjing and Suzhou city, China in 2018. Key informant interviews (n = 14) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with diverse transgender women were implemented. Text was transcribed and translated, and Dedoose™ software was used for coding, analysis and interpretation by the research team. Results: Chinese transgender women share experiences with transgender women worldwide, including a long and challenging identity search, stigma and discrimination, poor access to trans-specific services and unmet needs for mental health care. Features unique to them include terms used for self-identification, culturally-shaped expectations for reproduction, and ideals of placing the familial and societal welfare over personal fulfillment. Social networks of this population appear sparse, scattered, and underground. Familial rejection was experienced by nearly all respondents. Perceptions of HIV and STI risk and history of HIV testing were notably low.

Methods: A systematic literature review identifying all meta-analyses and reviews published over the past twenty years – from 1998 to 2018 inclusive – was therefore conducted in order to question the clinical and even explanatory value of the various attachment styles with respect to a certain type of offending. The bibliographic databases Science Direct, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, EMBASE and PubMed were examined using the following keywords and boolean operators: (attachment style) AND (criminal behavior) AND (offenders). Results: The data indicate that an insecure attachment style is significantly associated with all types of crime (violent behaviors, sexual violence, domestic violence, rule-breaking and antisocial behaviors), regardless of gender or age. The results also provides a network of correspondences and entanglements between particular attachment patterns and specific criminal acts; perpetrators of sexual violence are indeed characterized by a more anxious attachment style than perpetrators of violent offences, who themselves are more insecure in their relationships than perpetrators of non-sexual violence.

778,"© 2019Background: The rate of violent victimization against children with disabilities is thought to be lower than the rate for children without disabilities but several studies shows otherwise. Objective: The study focuses on examining violent crime against children with disabilities and explaining differences in victimization, in order to elucidate to what extent types of disability, family disadvantages, gender, high-risk behavior, location and indicator of ethnic minority (e.g. non-Danish citizens) influence adolescents’ risk of violent victimization. Previous population studies in this area lack scientifically sound research methodology and results are weak or inconclusive. Method: Data is based on a national study of reported violent crime against children in Denmark aged between 7 and 18 years, using total birth cohorts (N = 678,000). Data on types of disability were collected from the Danish national inpatient register. Violent-crime data were extracted from Danish police records. Within the birth cohorts studied, 3.5% of children had experienced a violent crime. A discrete-time Cox model was used for the statistical analysis, which included an extended list of potential risk factors to adjust for confounding. Results: Children with disabilities are more likely to be victims of a reported violent crime than non-disabled children – ADHD odds ratio: 2.7 (2.6–2.8), mental retardation: 2.7 (2.6–2.7), autism 2.6 (2.5–2.7), loss of hearing 1.4 (1.2–1.5), brain injury: 1.8 (1.7–1.9), physical disabilities 1.4 (1.2–1.5), and blindness 2.0 (1.4–2.8). Speech disability, epilepsy, stuttering, and dyslexia were not associated with increased risk of violent victimization, when adjusted for confounding risk factors and age.

780,"© 2019, The Author(s).Taking the perspective of the Central and West African women blocked at the Moroccan-Spanish border, reveals how EU policies, in exporting their anti-migrant war to African countries, seem to have reinforced a continuum of male dominance: by creating, along the migratory route, a succession of spaces where African women must resist and/or succumb to multiple relations of power and domination in order to be able to cross the securitized borders, controlled by a plurality of actors but often all men. Breaking with binary and essentialist views that often present them as merely passive subjects of their migration, the women interviewed disclose hidden mechanisms and effects of the externalization of EU migration control policies on the bodies and lives of those who fight for their freedom of movement. Based on 30-months of ethnographic research in Morocco and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, this article aims to show how EU border externalization provokes racialized and gendered vulnerabilization of people seeking mobility and notably reinforces gender-based violence against migrant women. There are several levels of violence against women seeking mobility at borders, we will focus on two: violence emanating from certain men who are part of the organization of the crossing, and violence exerted by the States policing the border. Both of these cases illustrate the interaction between mobility control policies and control over women’s bodies as an effect of border externalization.",2019-12-01,Journal,Article,Comparative Migration Studies,21100899442,18,7,From controlling mobilities to control over women’s bodies: gendered effects of EU border externalization in Morocco,1,true,10.1186/s40878-019-0128-4,Springer,Comparative Migration Studies,2019.0,0.0,0.0,,780,146669615,Elsa Tyszler,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,35.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not only essential in achieving justice; but it may also be key to the effectiveness, reliability, speed and efficiency of forensic operations. Ethics has received a great deal of attention in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. It has also received attention in the clinical and laboratory practice of forensic medicine. This attention has developed in the aftermath of various cases of unethical forensic practice. Various studies have stressed the importance of the formulation of clinical and professional forensic codes of ethics rather than organizational ones. This paper argues that the implementation of ethical leadership in any forensic organization is critical to the effectiveness, reliability, speed and efficiency of forensic operations. The promotion of clinical ethical practices is a function of top-level ethical leadership. Top-level ethical leaders should be acting as role models responsible for the promotion and implementation of ethics across all organizational levels.

Research suggests that structural interventions and changes are needed to reduce these phenomena and ensure that schools function as protective and secure learning environments for sexual minorities. Aim: This study presents a review of international interventions/programs focused on reducing bullying and promoting inclusive educational environments for transgender youths. Methods: An extensive literature search in English and Spanish was undertaken using the electronic database of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, SciELO and LILACS (1990–2018). Results: Several international programs, guidelines and projects aimed at preventing bullying against sexual minorities (including the transgender population) in school environments were described. Recommendations and barriers to consider in the development and implementation of bullying prevention interventions in a range of school settings are discussed. Conclusions: Evidence suggest important positive benefits associated with attending schools that have anti-bullying or inclusive policies for gender minorities, such as the improvement of school wellbeing, more positive school climate, decreasing truancy, lower levels of victimization, decreased school harassment and increased feelings of safety. However, more research is needed to follow up on the various programs and interventions described in this study, to determine whether they have been implemented and what their actual long-term impact has been.

Methods: Data from baseline online survey of UNIVERSAL project, a multicenter, observational study of first-year Spanish university students (18–24 years). We assessed STB; lifetime and 12-month negative life-events and family adversities; mental disorders; personal and community factors. Gender-specific regression models and gender-interactions were also analyzed. Results: We included 2,105 students, 55.4% women.

790,"© 2019 American Society of CriminologyWe examine the role of a norm protecting women in understanding third-party partisanship in verbal and violent disputes. Our analyses are based on reports provided by male inmates and men they know who have never been arrested. The results show that third parties are more likely to support female adversaries than male adversaries. The gender effect is stronger when we control for the relational distance between adversaries, which indicates that a privacy norm might inhibit this normative protection.

791,"© The Author(s) 2018.The lives of families entering the child protection arena may be shaped by a range of troubles, including material deprivation, physical and mental health problems, and substance misuse or domestic abuse. Despite the interest in whole family approaches, the issue of how professionals fail to work effectively with fathers is long-standing and resistant to change. This article illustrates challenges in building working relationships with men, including the challenge of avoiding binary thinking in the assessment of fathers as “risk” or “resource.” Drawing on our qualitative longitudinal study of men’s experiences of child protection in England, we highlight how both organizational (clashing time perspectives) and cultural (gendered-thinking) factors can trouble the potential relationship between social workers and fathers.

792,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is a sentinel surveillance program that collects and analyzes data on injuries and poisonings of people presenting to emergency departments (EDs) at 11 pediatric and eight general hospitals (currently) across Canada. To date, CHIRPP is an understudied source of child maltreatment (CM) surveillance data. This study: (1) describes CM cases identified in the CHIRPP database between1997/98 to 2010/11; (2) assesses the level of CM case capture over the 14-year period and; (3) uses content analysis to identify additional information captured in text fields. Methods: We reviewed cases of children under 16 whose injuries were reported as resulting from CM from 1997/98 to 2010/11. A time trend analysis of cases to assess capture was conducted and content analysis was applied to develop a codebook to assess information from text fields in CHIRPP. The frequency of types of CM and other variables identified from text fields were calculated. Finally, the frequency of types of CM were presented by age and gender. Results: A total of 2200 CM cases were identified. There was a significant decrease in the capture of CM cases between 1999 and 2005. Physical abuse was the most prevalent type (57%), followed by sexual assault (31%), unspecified maltreatment (7%), injury as the result of exposure to family violence (3%) and neglect (2%). Text fields provided additional information including perpetrator characteristics, the use of drugs and/or alcohol during the injury event, information regarding the involvement of non-health care professionals, whether maltreatment occurred during a visitation period with a parent and, whether the child was removed from their home. Conclusions: The findings from this initial study indicate that CHIRPP could be a complimentary source of CM data. As an injury surveillance system, physical abuse and sexual assault were better captured than other types of CM. Text field data provided unique information on a number of additional details surrounding the injury event, including risk factors.",2019-10-29,Journal,Article,BMC Pediatrics,14521,2,19,Sentinel surveillance of child maltreatment cases presenting to Canadian emergency departments,1,true,10.1186/s12887-019-1788-9,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Pediatrics,2019.0,58.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings from this initial study indicate that CHIRPP could be a complimentary source of CM data, and physical abuse and sexual assault were better captured than other types of CM.'}",792,4916799,A.

793,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdPsychopathy is associated with a variety of negative attitudes and behaviours towards women; however, the mechanisms that underlie these associations have yet to be fully examined. The current work examined dehumanization, a social-psychological construct, as a potential mechanism facilitating the association between sub-clinical psychopathy and negative attitudes towards women. Two online studies with all-male samples were conducted to examine whether dehumanization helps to explain the association between psychopathy and sexist and violent attitudes towards women. In Study 1 (n = 514), path analyses indicated that psychopathy was indirectly related to sexist and violent attitudes towards women through dehumanization. Study 2 (n = 265) replicated the findings of Study 1 regarding sexism. It also included a date rape analogue measure of violent attitudes and was able to expand on the findings of Study 1, though only for the interpersonal and affective components of psychopathy. These results may suggest that individuals high in psychopathic traits see women as sub-human, this dehumanizing appraisal may be facilitating attitudes and behaviours that are consistent with the idea that women are less than human and deserve to be treated as such.

A cross-sectional, mainly descriptive study using a standardized, paper-based, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted between August and October 2018 among emergency medical technicians (EMTs) in the Tainan City Fire Bureau, Taiwan. A total of 152 EMT-paramedics responded to the questionnaire survey, constituting an overall response rate of 96.2%. The participants were predominantly male (96.1%), college-educated (4-year bachelor’s degree) (49.3%), and middle-aged (35–44 years old) (63.8%). Among them, 113 (74.3%) and 75 (49.3%) participants had experienced verbal and physical assaults at work, respectively. Only 12 (7.9%) participants were familiar with relevant regulations or codes. The assaults predominantly occurred during evening shifts (16:00–24:00) and at the scene of the emergency. The most predominant violence perpetrators included patients, patients’ families, or patients’ friends. Nearly 10% of participants had experienced verbal assaults from hospital personnel. EMTs who encountered workplace violence rarely completed a paper report, filed for a lawsuit, or sought a psychiatric consultation. Fifty-eight (38.2%) and 16 (10.5%) participants were victims of frequent (at least once every 3 months) verbal and physical forms of violence, respectively; however, no statistically significant association was observed in terms of EMT gender, age, working years, education level, or the number of EMS deployments per month.

The current study tested a female-specific modification to an existing risk assessment instrument, the Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression: Women’s Version (DASA:WV). The modification involved addition of two factors taken from the Female Additional Manual used in conjunction with the HCR-20 (Covert/Manipulative Behaviour and Low Self-Esteem) and a rating of ward atmosphere to the original DASA. Nursing staff on a high secure female forensic unit rated patients on the DASA:WV at the end of each shift and recorded incidents of verbal aggression and physical aggression against others, objects, and self in the subsequent 24-hr period. Hierarchical (multilevel) logistic regression was employed in the statistical analysis to account for the incorporation of multiple repeated measures for each participant.

Mock jurors (N = 1,162) read a trial transcript where the child of a married couple witnessed one of the three types of intimate partner violence, perpetrated by the husband against his wife or the wife against her husband, and answered related questions. Mock jurors were asked to render a dichotomous verdict, continuous guilt rating, and rate their perceptions of the victim, defendant, and eyewitness. Male jurors were more likely to find the defendant guilty when the defendant was female and the witness was 16 years old; additionally, female mock jurors assigned higher guilt ratings for the male defendant compared to the female defendant. Mock jurors also assigned higher guilt ratings when the abuse was physical compared to both sexual and emotional; abuse also influenced perceptions of the defendant, victim, and eyewitness. Mock jurors also were more likely to hold positive perceptions of the eyewitness when she was 16 years old compared to 8 years old.

The aim of this article is to critically explore the influence of the Duluth model of IPV on the overarching conceptual frameworks used to explain CPV. Although gender socialization could indeed be a factor implicated in CPV, the prefixed assumptions of the Duluth model about gender as the ultimate etiological factor, have shaped and dominated the discourses of CPV resulting in devaluation of a range of other factors pertinent for understanding this type of violence. It has been established that violence, and more specifically family violence, is a highly complex phenomenon that has history and continuity; as such contextual, multi-modal explanations are favored (Asen & Fonagy, 2017).

800,"© 2019 McDougal et al.Financial inclusion is an area of growing global interest in women's empowerment policy and programming. While increased economic autonomy may be expected to reduce the prevalence of intimate partner violence, the mechanisms and contexts through which this relationship manifests are not well understood. This analysis aims to assess the relationship between women's financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence using nationallyrepresentative data from 112 countries worldwide. Levels of both financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence varied substantially across countries (ranging from 2-100%, and 1-46%, respectively), and across regions. In multivariate global analyses, increased levels of women's financial inclusion were associated with lower levels of recent intimate partner violence after accounting for asset-based enablers of economic autonomy and gender norms; this relationship was lost upon the inclusion of measures of national context (i.e., development and fragility). These results underscore that the relationship between financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence is complex, follows many pathways, and is affected by context. In low and middle income countries, asset-based enablers of economic autonomy, gender norms and national context explained much of the relationship between financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence. In those low and middle income countries with high levels of controlling behavior by male spouses, financial inclusion was associated with higher levels of recent intimate partner violence. These findings further suggest that initiatives that aim to prevent intimate partner violence by way of increased economic autonomy may be ineffective in the absence of broader social change and support, and indeed, as seen in countries with higher levels of men's controlling behavior, backlash may increase the risk of violence. Efforts to improve women's financial inclusion need to recognize that its relationship with intimate partner violence is complex, and that it requires an enabling environment supportive of women's rights and autonomy.",2019-10-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,5,14,Financial inclusion and intimate partner violence: What does the evidence suggest?,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0223721,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2019.0,48.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is suggested that initiatives that aim to prevent intimate partner violence by way of increased economic autonomy may be ineffective in the absence of broader social change and support, and indeed, as seen in countries with higher levels of men’s controlling behavior, backlash may increase the risk of violence.'}",800,29370173,L.

801,"© 2019Background: Violence and other adversities commonly co-occur, yet are usually investigated individually. The primary objectives of this paper are to investigate: (i) the relationship between maternal exposure to violence (including childhood abuse and intimate partner violence) and postpartum mental and physical health; and (ii) the extent to which exposure to violence and poor maternal mental and physical health are associated with children's emotional-behavioral difficulties. Methods: Prospective pregnancy cohort (n = 1507) followed up to 4 year postpartum. Validated measures used: Composite Abuse Scale; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, SF-36, Child Maltreatment History Self Report; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between maternal childhood abuse, intimate partner violence (IPV), maternal health and child emotional and behavioral difficulties at age 4. Outcomes: Two out of five women (41%) reported abuse in childhood, and almost one in three (29%) reported IPV during the first four years of motherhood. Women reporting both physical and sexual childhood abuse had markedly raised odds of IPV and poor physical and mental health at all time points (pregnancy, first year postpartum and four year postpartum). For the index child, violence exposures (maternal childhood abuse or IPV) and poor maternal physical or mental health were associated with higher odds of emotional/behavioral difficulties at age four. In multivariable models (adjusted for child gender and maternal age), cumulative exposures (multiple violence exposures or poor maternal mental or physical health at multiple time points) each independently added to increased odds of emotional-behavioral difficulties. Children of mothers who reported a history of childhood abuse but were not exposed to IPV had odds of difficulties similar to children of mothers not reporting any violence exposure, suggesting resilient outcomes where violence experiences are not repeated in the next generation. Interpretation: The clustering of risk (child and adult violence experiences) and the accumulation of risk within families (IPV, poor maternal health, child difficulties) highlight the need for effective early intervention to limit or ameliorate the impact of violence across the lifespan, and to break the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage.",2019-10-01,Journal,Article,EClinicalMedicine,21100903225,21,15,Intergenerational Impacts of Family Violence - Mothers and Children in a Large Prospective Pregnancy Cohort Study,1,true,10.1016/j.eclinm.2019.08.008,Lancet Publishing Groupcususerv@lancet.com,EClinicalMedicine,2019.0,66.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The clustering of risk and the accumulation of risk within families (IPV, poor maternal health, child difficulties) highlight the need for effective early intervention to limit or ameliorate the impact of violence across the lifespan, and to break the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage.'}",801,4933930,D.

Research on their causes and attitudinal correlates has rarely examined implicit, automatic cognitive associations related to the partner (in IPV aggressors) or to women (in sexual harassment offenders). The aim of the present research was to study these implicit associations in 129 male German students. Participants completed scales of hostile sexism (HS), masculine gender role stress (MGRS), short-term (STMO) and long-term mating orientation (LTMO), and proclivity to both IPV and sexual harassment. Next they performed a primed lexical decision task that measured whether concepts of violence, power, hostility, and sexuality were differentially associated with representations of women, men, and the participant’s own intimate partner. Results showed that implicit associations of own partner with violence as well as hostility were generally high but did not correlate strongly with the proclivity measures. Furthermore, the proclivity measures were positively predicted by HS, MGRS, and STMO, whereas LTMO negatively predicted IPV proclivity. Practice implications point to the need to address early socialization processes that may shape men’s negative associations with female partners.

Results suggest small, significant effect sizes for all the family (various forms of child maltreatment, parental support, and parental monitoring) and peer factors (peer victimization, sexual harassment, affiliation with deviant peers, and supportive/prosocial peers) in the prediction of DV. With few exceptions, forms of DV (psychological, physical, and sexual), gender, and age did not moderate the strength of these associations. In addition, no difference was found between the magnitude of family and peer factors’ effect sizes, suggesting that these determinants are equally important in predicting DV. The current results provide future directions for examining relations between risk and protective factors for DV and indicate that both peers and family should be part of the development of efficient prevention options.",2019-10-01,Journal,Review,"Trauma, Violence, and Abuse",13124,64,20,A Meta-Analysis of Risk and Protective Factors for Dating Violence Victimization: The Role of Family and Peer Interpersonal Context,0,false,10.1177/1524838017725336,SAGE Publications Ltdinfo@sagepub.co.uk,"Trauma, Violence, & Abuse",2019.0,148.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The current results provide future directions for examining relations between risk and protective factors for DV and indicate that both peers and family should be part of the development of efficient prevention options.'}",804,2248715,M.

805,"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Gender inequality and sexism are often at the root of domestic violence against women and children, with both serving to justify male domination. This runs in parallel with mother-blaming bias, which constitutes a pervasive common sense and scientific error derived from the myth of the good and the bad mother, characterising a large part of studies on deviance. The purpose of this paper is to consider the possible role of sexism in prisoners’ deviant biographies; for this, the authors considered the role of the mother in the biographies of prisoners, and the results lend support to the idea that mother-blaming is a serious fallacy. Starting from a critical psychology point of view and following the retrospective methodology, the authors interviewed 22 drug-addicted prisoners through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) regarding their biographies and their relationships with parents and partners. Design/methodology/approach: In the survey, the authors followed the same intention, and the results lend support to the idea that mother-blaming is a serious fallacy. The authors interviewed 22 drug-addicted prisoners through IPA concerning their biographies and their relationships with parents and partners. Findings: The main result of this qualitative study was the recognition of a fundamental sexism assumed by participants, characterised by a paradox between the representation of the mother and the representation of the ideal woman. Despite the mother being their positive affective referent, and battered by her husband/partner, the same participants had been witnesses of domestic violence, and sometimes victims, they interiorised from their father an ambivalent sexism: benevolent sexism with regard to their mother and exhibited hostile sexism with their partner. On the one hand, it emerged that female empowerment was desirable with respect to the mothers. On the other hand, the ideal woman was exactly as their mother was, that is, being absolutely subordinated to men (a patient, caring, submissive housewife, totally dedicated to her children and her husband). Research limitations/implications: From a mainstream psychological perspective, the limits of the research are linked to the utilisation of the narrative method. Also, this methodology does not verify any hypotheses, so quotations from the participants are used to illustrate themes, and thus, it is difficult to report the informational complexities arising from the dialogues. However, the literature has emphasised that these limitations do not invalidate qualitative research findings, despite the difficulties in generalising the results of the qualitative studies. Thereafter, the critical analysis moved within the intersection of experience-centred approaches and the culturally oriented treatment of narratives, so that the focus on the stories of the prisoners makes meaning because it applies structure to experience, albeit, with the form and content of the texts. This research did not permit us to measure and evaluate post-hoc any post-traumatic hypotheses, which, in turn, would give room for further research. Another limitation of the research was that the relationship between culture of origin and gender biases, especially with participants from non-European countries, was not analysed. This topic would require an important in-depth study, which encompasses how women are treated in different countries and its effects on social maladjustment for immigrants in Italy. Practical implications: The outcome of this study suggests that within similar structures in the Institute of Mitigated Custody, the theme of sexism should be considered in more depth. Since sexism justifies violence against women, and is therefore a factor that can cause recidivism in the antisocial behaviour of prisoners once they have served their sentences. It is important to allow them to analyse the relationship between their sexist attitudes, witnessing violence in childhood and the possibility of changing moral values of reference in favour of equality. This type of psychological intervention must necessarily be based not only on the elaboration of traumas suffered during childhood with an abusive father, but also on issues related to gender equality and the theme of social inclusion. Social implications: The study suggests the idea that male sexism can be a factor responsible for suffering and maladjustment for men and that therefore an education that promotes equality of gender differences can also help prevent the social distress associated with drug addiction and deviance. Originality/value: The paper considers some cogent issues inherent to ambivalent sexism that pervades prisoners’ aspirations for their future.",2019-09-18,Journal,Article,International Journal of Prisoner Health,4700152708,7,15,Prisoners’ ambivalent sexism and domestic violence: a narrative study,2,,10.1108/IJPH-09-2018-0046,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,International Journal of Prisoner Health,2019.0,119.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The outcome of this study suggests that within similar structures in the Institute of Mitigated Custody, the theme of sexism should be considered in more depth, and suggests the idea that male sexism can be a factor that can cause recidivism in the antisocial behaviour of prisoners once they have served their sentences.'}",805,7437221,I.

807,"© Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.Serial murder and other acts of extreme violence are popular themes in U.S. news and entertainment media, yet few empirical studies have attempted to explain what draws consumers to these themes. Drawing on literature in mass media and violence studies, we developed an experiment to examine characteristics of serial murder media (i.e., victims' gender and number killed) and characteristics of would-be viewers (i.e., gender and age group) that may contribute to higher levels of public interest in this type of media. We developed four versions of a film synopsis purporting to be a biographical account of a notorious serial killer, manipulating only the number and gender of the purported victims. Nearly 700 U.S. adults participated in the experiment, for which each was asked to read one of the four randomly assigned versions of the film synopsis and then answer three items designed to measure subjects' level of interest in the film. Results indicate two significant main effects for subject gender and subject age, as well as two significant interaction effects that reveal links between all four independent variables. Findings overall are not only consistent with previous literature but also offer unique insights related to gender role socialization, gendered and age-related patterns in violent crime victimization, and the distinction between exposure to and enjoyment of media violence.",2019-09-01,Journal,Article,Violence and Gender,21100801744,0,6,Effects of Gender and Age on U.S. Adults' Interest in Cinematic Serial Murder,0,false,10.1089/vio.2019.0001,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.info@liebertpub.com,Violence and Gender,2019.0,23.0,0.0,,807,2196835390,B.

810,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdRationale: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent issue in refugee and internally displaced populations in post-war and migration settings including camps in the Middle East. In this context, partner violence has been associated with war-related trauma, camp factors, individual characteristics, and gender attitudes. Objective: With a dual-informant survey among a sample of Iraqi couples residing in a camp for displaced people in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (N = 92) this study investigated the relationship between war-related psychopathology, attitudes towards women, and male-perpetrated partner violence. Method: Moderated regression analysis was applied using information from both partners to predict partner violence reported by wives. Results: Over 58% of the women in this sample reported past-year exposure to partner violence. Further analyses revealed significant main effects of men's self-reported psychopathology (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression) and their own gender attitudes on partner violence. In a multivariate regression, moderating effects were found, as higher psychopathology levels and inequitable gender attitudes in men interacted in the prediction of male-perpetrated partner violence. Conclusions: This study highlights the high prevalence of partner violence among Iraqi displaced women. In addition, the results show an interplay of several violence-impelling factors in war-affected men.

811,"© 2019Background: This study examined the association between disrespect and abuse of women during facility-based childbirth and postpartum depression (PD) occurrence. Methods: We used data from the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort, a population-based cohort of all live births in the city. We assessed 3065 mothers at pregnancy and 3-months after birth. Self-reported disrespect and abuse experiences included physical abuse, verbal abuse, denial of care, and undesired procedures. We estimate the occurrence of each disrespect and abuse type, one or more types and disrespect and abuse score. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess PD. EPDS scores ≥13 and ≥15 indicated at least moderate PD and marked/severe. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of at least moderate PD and marked/severe PD was 9.4% and 5.7%, respectively. 18% of the women experienced at least one type of disrespect and abuse. Verbal abuse increased the odds of having at least moderate PD (OR = 1.58; 95%CI 1.06–2.33) and marked/severe PD (OR = 1.69; 95%CI 1.06–2.70) and the effect among women who did not experience antenatal depressive symptoms was greater in comparison to those who did (OR = 2.51; 95%CI 1.26–5.04 and OR = 4.27; 95%CI 1.80–10.12). Physical abuse increased the odds of having marked/severe PD (OR = 2.28; 95%CI 1.26–4.12). Having experienced three or more mistreatment types increased the odds of at least moderate PD (OR = 2.90; 95%CI 1.30 - 35.74) and marked/severe PD (OR=3.86; 95%CI 1.58–9.42).

Methods: Those cases admitted to the emergency department (ED) for any reason that required a forensic examination between January 2016 and June 2018 were investigated retrospectively. Results: A total of 310 refugees were admitted to the ED for forensic medical events. The most common nations of origin of the refugees were Iraq (n = 167), Syria (n = 65), and Afghanistan (n = 28). The median age of the refugees was 24 years old (interquartile range = 17–33). With regard to forensics, the most common reasons for the refugees to present to the ED were motor vehicle accidents 27.4%, assaults 25.8%, employment and industrial accidents 16.1%, and suicide attempts 10.3%. Other than suicide attempts, all of the forensic presentations were more common in the males. The outcomes of the refugee group were as follows: 92.3% were discharged, 5.8% were admitted to the hospital, 1% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 1% were transferred. Suicide attempts were the most common reasons for the ICU admissions, while the most common reasons for the hospital admissions were orthopedic injuries.

814,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: The article aims to analyze the representativeness of women in ethnobiological publications within the Brazilian context, as well as to relate the difficulties faced by women in their scientific careers in terms of gender bias. Biases found in publications are relevant themes to different areas of knowledge, considering the historical persistence of male privilege in these activities. We analyzed the role of women in ethnobiological scientific publications and sought to reflect on gender issues in academic practices and fieldwork. Methods: We conducted a 28-year survey of academic publications in Brazil, through the Scopus and Web of Science databases, in order to infer the female representation in ethnobiological literature. We also sent 77 questionnaires to ethnobiologists associated with the Brazilian society of ethnobiology and ethnoecology or indicted by associates through snowball sampling. Results: We observed that there are more articles where the senior author is male (p < 0.05). However, there are no differences in the number of publications led by men and women (p > 0.05), which shows a positive trend in terms of representation. Within subareas, ethnozoology had more male authors than other subareas of ethnobiology. Articles whose senior authors are men tend to be published in journals with a higher impact (p < 0.05). The interviews with Brazilian ethnobiologists showed that 53.2% of the interviewees reported feeling discriminated against in the academic environment because they were women. Moreover, 61.0% said they had disadvantages in collecting data because they were women. Additionally, most of the researchers reported having witnessed cases of sexism in the studied communities. Conclusion: In the current scenarios of female participation, it is possible to reflect and identify advances and challenges associated with gender bias in ethnobiological studies conducted by Brazilian, both in the emic and etic spheres of research and in our scientific practice.

Method A cross-sectional study combining qualitative and quantitative methods was carried out from 2009 to 2015 with a sample of 12,023 migrants in transit through Mexico to the US. Information on gender (male, female, and transsexual, transgender and transvestite -TTTs-); nationality; health status; migratory background; and experiences with violence was obtained. Fifty-eight migrants participated in in-depth interviews to explore any experiences of violence during their journey. A descriptive analysis was performed and a probit regression model was applied to analyze the factors associated with violence. Qualitative information was analyzed to understand experiences, meanings and responses to violence. Results The overall prevalence of suffering from any form of violence was 29.4%. Nearly 24% reported physical violence, 19.5% experienced psychological violence, and approximately 2% reported sexual violence. TTTs experienced a significantly greater burden of violence compared to men and women. Violence occurred more frequently among migrants from Central American (30.6%) and other countries (40.0%) than it did among Mexican migrants (20.5%). Experiences involving sexual, physical and psychological violence as well as theft and even kidnapping were described by interviewees. Migrants mistrust the police, migration authorities, and armed forces, and therefore commonly refrain from revealing their experiences. Conclusion Migrants are subjected to a high level of violence while in transit to the US. Those traveling under irregular migratory conditions are targets of even greater violence, a condition exacerbated by gender inequality. Migrants transiting through Mexico from Central American and other countries undergo violence more frequently than do Mexican migrants.

817,"© The Author(s) 2016.We know from the violence literature that a distinct sex disparity exists in the perpetration of other-directed violence (ODV). Some scholars suggest that this disparity is explained in part by gendered reactions to stress, strain, or violence victimization, in which males and females engage in different coping mechanisms, with males more likely to engage in ODV than females. Using a college sample, we investigate the behavioral responses of male and female victims of psychological intimate partner abuse. We find that although there is a sex disparity in the use of ODV as a coping mechanism, there is also a distinct gender orientation disparity.

We then examined six risk factors drawn from previous literature of partner violence: physical abuse as a child, antisocial personality characteristics, alcohol abuse, coercive control, chronic denigration in a relationship, and patriarchy at the societal level. We hypothesized that some risk factors for assault are different dependent on the DCT. Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that some risk factors were associated with an increase in the risk of a couple being in the Male Only assaulted DCT more than the other two DCTs (e.g., men who were high in antisocial personality characteristics). Other risk factors were found to be associated with a greater increase in the risk a couple being in the Both assaulted DCTs (e.g., chronic denigration).

819,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal MedicineBackground: Mortality is conditioned by biological, political and social factors, as well as by culturally defined behaviors and attitudes that historically characterize the stage of development of a country or a region. Women are often in great danger, where they should be safest. Violence against women is the most pervasive yet the least recognized human rights violation in the world. It is a profound health problem and femicide, is often the tragic end-point of violence. Females represent more than half of the Egyptian population, however, they remain vulnerable. Aim of the study: To describe and analyze data obtained from Zeinhom Morgue records in Cairo, regarding female deaths, throughout two years. To evaluate female deaths regarding age, cause, manner of death, location, perpetrator and motive. To describe the incidence of female homicides and their related injury patterns. To identify the risk factors and nature of violence from victimologic point of view. Finally, to describe the manner of death whether natural, homicidal, suicidal or accidental aiming for early identification of vulnerable females so that actions can be taken to prevent further mortality. Subjects and Methods: This is a national two year retrospective descriptive mortuary based study. The study population comprised of all adult females, aged 18 years and older, whose death was suspicious and medico-legal examination was ordered. Each investigation included a detailed case history, investigation, gross examination, histo-pathological and toxicological examinations. Data was collected from autopsy reports, hospital records and police records. From the available data the victim profile was made. Results: All female deaths aged 18 years and older were retrospectively reviewed for 2 years at Zeinhom morgue of Medico-legal Authority from a total of 1858 autopsy cases. The most common manner of death was homicide. The commonest cause of death in homicides was due to sharp traumatic injuries. Natural death was the least common manner of death and ischemic heart disease constituted the commonest cause. Falling from height was the most common method of suicidal related deaths. Regarding poisoned cases, insecticides and carbon monoxide were the most common detected poisons. According to the cause of death (trauma), blunt trauma injuries were the most common. Falling from height constituted the largest percent of cases under this group. Conclusion and recommendations: Females in the third decade of life with blunt injuries to the head and neck were the majority of adult female autopsies. Homicide was the most common manner of female death using sharp instruments after domestic arguments mainly by a spouse or relative. Accidental death came second mainly due to post-operative complications. In cases of suicide, falling from height was the commonest cause followed by poisoning. These findings could be useful for forensic pathologists and healthcare promoters in predicting and preventing female deaths. Moreover, this emphasizes the need for raising public awareness about the scale of female violence problem in our society. The results of this study indicates that, by not only a strong legal support network, but also by opportunities for economic independency, essential education and awareness, alternative accommodation and a change in attitude and mindset of society, judiciary, legislature, executive, men and most importantly women themselves can lower or even prevent such deaths specially suicidal.",2019-08-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,5100154502,4,66,"A descriptive medico-legal study of female deaths in cairo governorate, Egypt",0,false,10.1016/j.jflm.2019.05.018,Churchill Livingstone,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,2019.0,34.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results of this study indicate that, by not only a strong legal support network, but also by opportunities for economic independency, essential education and awareness, alternative accommodation and a change in attitude and mindset of society, judiciary, legislature, executive, men and most importantly women themselves can lower or even prevent such deaths specially suicidal.'}",819,83095602,N.

820,"© 2019 National Council on Family RelationsObjective: This article examines the relationship between the exposure of men as children to gender-equitable parental decision making and the potential for subsequent later life engagement in intimate partner violence (IPV) in Bangladesh. Background: Although researchers have recently begun to explore multilevel influences on IPV perpetration, no studies have examined how decision making between parents at home and within the community relates to IPV perpetration in low-income settings. Drawing on a theoretical framework of gendered social learning, gender-equitable parental decision making may be an important protective factor against IPV. Method: This study uses a random probability sample of 1,499 married men in Bangladesh. The main outcome is physical IPV perpetration in adulthood, whereas two exposure variables measure the equity of parental decision making in the man's childhood home and his current community. A series of two-level negative binomial models, controlling for pertinent individual- and community-level factors, are estimated. Results: Exposure in childhood to more equitable decision making between parents is negatively associated with a man's physical IPV perpetration in adulthood. Gender-equitable parental decision making within one's current community is not significantly associated with IPV. Conclusion: Boys who grow up exposed to more equitable decision making between parents in the home may be less likely to engage in physical IPV perpetration as an adult.",2019-08-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Marriage and Family,15653,7,81,Gender-Equitable Parental Decision Making and Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration in Bangladesh,2,,10.1111/jomf.12579,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Journal of Marriage and Family,2019.0,100.0,0.0,,820,65926962,Daniel C.

821,"© The Author(s) 2018.In 1996, a Guatemalan woman named Rody Alvarado was granted asylum in the United States but the decision was revoked three years later, triggering a controversy over border control, domestic violence and the standards of refugee protection. Through an intersectional, geographical and historical excavation of Alvarado’s case, I illustrate how adjudicators justified revoking asylum by initially framing her as a victim of unfortunate domestic abuse and then as a “scalar threat” to the spatial and legal order. By tracing the gendered and racialized discursive tactics and legal maneuvers deployed to prevent her from winning asylum, I demonstrate the raced, classed and gendered logics that structured legal decision-making and the pivotal role of intimate violence in processes of legal border control. Through a deep contextualization of Alvarado’s case, the paper advances critical and feminist geopolitical scholarship on the mutual constitution of the global and the intimate. In particular, I seek to advance feminist legal archeology as a methodology in political geography to make visible the discursive tactics and legal maneuvers involved in the struggle to delineate juridical and territorial borders, specifically as they relate to gender violence.

823,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Although intimate partner violence (IPV) is considered stereotypically as a gendered phenomenon, empirical evidence contradicts such gender asymmetry in reported rates of victimisation and perpetration. The current research explored the impact of stereotype priming on implicit attitudes associated with IPV victimisation (Study 1) and perpetration (Study 2), and further examined behavioural intentions associated with hypothetical gendered scenarios of IPV. Participants recruited in the United Kingdom were primed with either stereotype congruent, incongruent or no information about IPV victimisation (Study 1, n = 122) or perpetration rates (Study 2, n = 101). They then completed an Implicit Association Test and reported their subjective norms, self-efficacy, behavioural intentions, and outcome expectancies pertaining to different scenarios depicting gendered IPV. Findings indicate that priming an incongruent stereotype did not impact significantly on implicit or explicit attitudes toward IPV. Gendered scenarios were found to be influential on explicit attitudes, with IPV less likely to be identified toward male victims and considered more acceptable compared to when the victim was female. Moreover, individuals reported feeling more capable and likely to intervene in an act of IPV when the victim was female compared to male, were more likely to report such an incident, and anticipated greater outcomes.

In this paper, we explore the impact of the 2017 Australian Marriage Equality vote on CALD LGBTIQ+ people residing in Greater Western Sydney (GWS), which is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas of Australia, and where there was a significant ‘no’ vote. The 14-week campaign before the Marriage Equality vote resulted in significant social and individual trauma and damage to existing, fraught family relationships for LGBTIQ+ Australians (Ecker & Bennett, 2017). The findings from this research highlight that while CALD LGBTIQ+ people experience high levels of family violence at the time of coming out and during events such as the Marriage Equality vote, families are also an incredible source of support when CALD LGBTIQ+ are accepted by their families and wider communities.

Therefore, we set to summarize the findings of existing primary studies to generate evidence for informed decisions to tackle domestic violence against women in low and lower-middle income countries.

Published and unpublished studies written in English and conducted among women aged (15-49 years) from 1994 to 2017 were eligible. Data were extracted independently by two authors, and recorded in Microsoft Excel sheet. Heterogeneity between included studies was assessed using I2, and publication bias was explored using visual inspection of funnel plot. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine the pooled prevalence using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. In addition, sub-group analysis was carried out by study-setting and types of intimate partner violence. Results: Fifty two studies were included in the systematic review. Of these, 33 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of lifetime intimate partner violence was 55% (95% CI: 52, 59%). Of these, main categories were lifetime physical violence [39% (95% CI: 33, 45%); psychological violence [45% (95% CI: 40, 52%)] and sexual violence [20% (95% CI: 17, 23%)]. Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of current intimate partner violence was 38% (95% CI: 34, 43%). Of these, physical violence [25% (95% CI: 21, 28%)]; psychological violence [30% (95% CI: 24, 36%)] and sexual violence [7.0% (95% CI: 6.6, 7.5%)] were the pooled prevalence for the major types of intimate partner violence. In addition, concurrent intimate partner violence was 13% (95% CI: 12, 15%). Individual, relationship, community and societal level factors were associated with intimate partner violence. Traditional community gender-norm transformation, stakeholders' engagement, women's empowerment, intervention integration and policy/legal framework were highly recommended interventions to prevent intimate partner violence. Conclusion: Lifetime and current intimate partner violence is common and unacceptably high. Therefore, concerned bodies will need to design and implement strategies to transform traditional gender norms, engage stakeholders, empower women and integrate service to prevent violence against women.

830,"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics SocietyThe genetic correlates of extreme impulsive violence are poorly understood, and there have been no studies that have systematically characterized a large group of affected individuals both clinically and genetically. We performed a genome-wide rare copy number variant (CNV) analysis in 281 males from four Czech prisons who met strict clinical criteria for extreme impulsive violence. Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 18 years, an ICD-10 diagnosis of Dissocial Personality Disorder, and the absence of an organic brain disorder. Participants underwent a structured psychiatric assessment to diagnose extreme impulsive violence and then provided a blood sample for genetic analysis. DNA was genotyped and CNVs were identified using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 single-nucleotide polymorphism array platform. Comparing with 10851 external population controls, we identified 828 rare CNVs (frequency ≤ 0.1% among control samples) in 264 participants. The CNVs impacted 754 genes, with 124 genes impacted more than once (2-25 times). Many of these genes are associated with autosomal dominant or X-linked disorders affecting adult behavior, cognition, learning, intelligence, specifically expressed in the brain and relevant to synapses, neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration, obesity and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Specifically, we identified 31 CNVs of clinical relevance in 31 individuals, 59 likely clinically relevant CNVs in 49 individuals, and 17 recurrent CNVs in 65 individuals. Thus, 123 of 281 (44%) individuals had one to several rare CNVs that were indirectly or directly relevant to impulsive violence.

An emphasis on offending histories may assist in identifying opportunities for criminal justice interventions, but it remains unclear whether these histories differ across different victim- offender relationship types. The aim of this study is to compare the offending histories of male intimate partner homicide (IPH) offenders and male-on-male homicide (MMH) offenders. Method: The data consist of self-reported offending histories collected through interviews with 203 men convicted of murder or manslaughter in Australia. IPH offenders (n = 68) were compared with MMH offenders (n = 135) across four areas (prevalence, frequency, versatility, and age of onset) using binary logistic regressions. Results: IPH offenders reported lower offending prevalence, less frequent and versatile offending, and later offending onset compared with MMH offenders. Conclusions: Both IPH and MMH offenders have a history of offending, though the extensiveness of this offending differs. Thus, IPH men may be less likely to come to the attention of the criminal justice system and, when they do, they may not be classified as ""high risk.""

832,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Aim of this study is to determine if peer group risk behaviors and neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) would ecologically affect injury incidence according to place and gender among adolescents (aged 13-15) in South Korea. Methods: Three variables from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2014) were used to represent peer group risk behaviours; current alcohol consumption (cAlc), the experience of violence or bullying (VicVB), and having undergone education for injury prevention (Edu-IP). The Korea Census Data (2010) was used for neighborhood SES; the degree of urbanization, the proportion of high educational attainment, and the proportion of low residential environment. The nationwide and regional Incidence-Rates of Injury assessed by EMS (IRI-EMS) were calculated according to age and gender based on the number of injuries from EMS record (2014). A linear regression model was used to examine associations. Results: The nationwide total and inside-school IRI-EMS were 623.8 and 139.3 per 100,000 population, respectively. The range of the regional IRI-EMS showed a maximum of about 4 times the difference from 345 to 1281 per 100,000 population depending on the region. The low residential environment had a significant effect on the increase of total IRI-EMS (β = 7.5, 95% CI 0.78-14.21). In the case of boys, the IRI-EMS inside-school was increased as the percentage of VicVB was higher (β = 17.0, 95% CI 1.09-32.91). In the case of girls, the IRI-EMS outside-school was increased in rural compared to urban location (β = 211.3, 95% CI 19.12-403.57). Conclusion: The incidence rate of outside-school was higher than that of inside-school, and incidence rate of boys was higher than that of girls. Peer group risk behaviors were significant only in the injury of boys. Among the SES factors, rural area was a significant factor in girls, especially outside-school injury. Moreover, the rate of households not in an apartment was significant in all outside-school injury and outside-school injury of boys.

Research specific to adult male prisoners indicates an association between childhood abuse experiences and crime recidivism, mental health issues, substance abuse and interpersonal difficulties. The purpose of this review was to conduct a systematic investigation of databases, using predetermined search strategies and key terms, in order to collate and describe the current literature examining the impact childhood abuse has on the functioning of adult males incarcerated for criminal offences. The investigation yielded 217 studies, which, through further analysis, was reduced to a total of 17 peer-reviewed articles. A narrative synthesis summary of findings was subsequently carried out. The findings identified four main themes, revealing the means by which childhood abuse impacts the functioning of adult male prisoners: mental health difficulties, crime and recidivism, substance use and behaviour/personality issues. In addition, less robust themes of revictimisation and adult life functional difficulties were revealed.

Materials and Methods: A national representative sample (n = 1059) of adults aged 18 years and older was chosen to complete a face-to-face survey on videogame perceptions and the use of Pokémon Go. Statistical analyses included 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) around the estimate, multiple regression, cluster, and factor analysis. Results: The 85.2% of the population (n = 866) were familiar with videogames, especially those in the 18-to 29-year age group (96.3%) and college education (94.8%).

This study describes incidences of GBV, as well as factors associated with sexual assault, among female adolescents in class six living in urban informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods Study participants were interviewed using a structured survey instrument focusing on experiences of GBV, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence, and corresponding perpetrators, as well as gender attitudes, alcohol use, self-efficacy, and previous sexual experiences. Summary statistics and clustered bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated for social behaviors and violence rates. Stepwise logistic regression identified variables associated with an adolescent’s experience of sexual assault. Findings In this population 72% of adolescent girls reported being raped in the prior twelve months, with 111% of these rape victims reporting over five experiences. Among the 213% who report having had a boyfriend, 381% reported emotional, physical, and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV). Boyfriends were identified most often as perpetrators, accounting for 463% of reported lifetime rapes. Previous experience of physical (p = <0001) or emotional (p<0001) IPV and home violence (p<0001) were risk factors for being raped, while high self-efficacy (p<0001) was a protective factor. Interpretation Sexual assault and GBV are major challenges in this highly-disadvantaged population. Novel prevention efforts are needed for this age group, as prevention is often targeted at older adolescents. Prevention efforts should focus on assaults by perpetrators known to adolescents, especially boyfriends, and may need to account for the adolescents’ previous experience of, and exposure to, violence.",2019-06-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,6,14,"Prevalence and risk factors for sexual assault among class 6 female students in unplanned settlements of Nairobi, Kenya: Baseline analysis from the IMPower & Sources of Strength cluster randomized controlled trial",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0213359,Public Library of Science,PLoS ONE,2019.0,28.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Novel prevention efforts are needed for this age group, as prevention is often targeted at older adolescents, and may need to account for the adolescents’ previous experience of, and exposure to, violence.'}",839,47788618,M.

841,"© 2019Background: For the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases, the WHO recommended to rename transgender transidentity as “gender incongruence”, to remove it from the chapter of mental and behavioral disorders, and to put it in a new category titled “Conditions related to sexual health”. This should contribute to reduce stigmatisation while maintaining access to medical care. One argument in favor of depsychiatrisation is to demonstrate that essential features of gender identity disorders, namely psychological distress and functional impairment, are not necessarily reported by every transgender person, and may result from social rejection and violence rather than dysphoria itself. Initially confirmed in Mexico, these hypotheses were tested in a specific French medical context, where access to care does not require any prior mental health evaluation or diagnosis. Method: In 2017, 72 transgender persons completed retrospective interviews which focused on the period when they became aware that they might be transgender and perhaps would need to do something about it. Results: Results showed that psychological distress and functional impairment were not reported by every participant, that they may result from rejection and violence, and especially from rejection and violence coming from coworkers and schoolmates. Additional data showed that the use of health services for body transformation did not depend on distress and dysfunction. Finally, participants preferred ICD 11 to employ “transgender” or “transidentity” rather than “gender incongruence”. Conclusion: Results support depsychiatrisation.

With a sample of 352 sexual and gender minority youth assigned female at birth (ages 16–32), we aimed to describe IPV in this population, including the prevalence, directionality, frequency, co-occurrence, and demographic correlates of various IPV types. Rates of past-6-month IPV were high, with victimization and perpetration of minor psychological IPV most common (64–70%); followed by severe psychological, minor physical, and coercive control (21–33%); and severe physical and sexual IPV (10–15%). For cyber abuse and IPV tactics leveraging anti-sexual minority stigma, victimization (12.5% and 14.8%, respectively) was more common than perpetration (8% and 5.7%, respectively). Most IPV was bidirectional and occurred 1–2 times in 6 months, although the frequency varied considerably. Latent class analyses revealed that half of the participants reported no or minimal IPV; one-third experienced multiple forms of psychological IPV (including coercive control); and 10–15% reported psychological, physical, sexual, and cyber abuse.

Using administrative data from the Finnish Homicide Monitor (N =1,494), we created a typology of homicide incidents to examine variation in VP across three factors: the gender of the offender, the gender of the victim, and the intimacy of the victim–offender relationship. The results from regression models demonstrated strong support for the assumption that killings by women of their male intimate partners are more likely to have been victim precipitated than other types of homicide. This homicide type stood out as having the strongest association with each measure of VP included in the analysis. We did not observe statistically significant differences in VP among other homicide types. For example, we did not observe gender differences in VP in homicides that did not involve intimate partners. This pattern of results contradicts prior evidence suggesting that VP is a general feature of female-perpetrated killings, independent of the gender of the victim and the intimacy of the victim–offender relationship.

845,"© 2019, © 2019 National Communication Association.In this essay, I analyze print news coverage concerning the feminicides in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, which some legal advocates-activists position as a crime against humanity. Such a classification underscores the magnitude that one might expect, but fails, to manifest in news coverage. Spanning a 14-year period, I examine 113 print news articles published in the U.S. Combining framing analysis with considerations of loss and grievability, revealed are three frames, their rhetorical dimensions and rhetorical distance effected. One frame, a “city of two faces,” is simultaneously absent and filled with violence that structures understandings of Ciudad Juárez. The oppositional nature of the “faces,” combined with the manifestations of violence, produce “negative valence” that bears on a second frame of “victims, bodies, and murdered women.” Its rhetorical contours provoke discursive violence resulting in double violations against Mexican women and girls of the feminicides. The final frame, “grieving mothers,” is limited in its ability to counteract rhetorical distance fostered by the first two frames. Individually and combined, the frames effect discursive violence, conceived as masking or effacing other forms of violence and/or productive of negative valence, that colludes with other manifestations of violence all the while ignoring U.S. complicity. Recognizing discursive violence for what it is, and the role of media frames, reveals how profoundly audiences could be primed. Media frames can activate audiences so that they view violence as an inevitability in Mexico, view the victims as less than sympathetic, and pity grieving mothers. Therefore, this analysis orients scholars’ attention to the ways that discourse fosters rhetorical distance and advances more concretely the relationship of frames and discursive violence.",2019-05-27,Journal,Article,Critical Studies in Media Communication,14215,7,36,Rhetorical contours of violent frames and the production of discursive violence,0,false,10.1080/15295036.2019.1575516,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,Critical Studies in Media and Communication,2019.0,136.0,0.0,,845,69545218,M.

849,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: In Europe, it is estimated that one third of women had experienced at least one physical or sexual violence after their 15. Taking into account the severe health consequences, the Emergency Department (ED), may offer an opportunity to recognize when an aggression is part of the spectrum of violence. This study applies Social Network analysis (SNA) to ED data in the Lazio region with the objective to identify patterns of diagnoses, within all the ED accesses of women experiencing an aggression, that are signals for gender-based violence against women. We aim to develop a risk assessment tool for ED professionals in order to strength their ability to manage victims of violence. Methods: A cohort of 124,691 women aged 15-70 with an ED visit for aggression between 2003 and 2015 was selected and, for each woman, the ED history of diagnoses and traumas was reconstructed. SNA was applied on all these diagnoses and traumas, including also 9 specific violence diagnoses. SNA community detection algorithms and network centrality measures were used to detect diagnostic patterns more strongly associated to violence. A logistic model was developed to validate the capability of these patterns to predict the odds for a woman of having an history of violence. Model results were summed up into a risk chart. Results: Among women experiencing an aggression, SNA identified four communities representing specific violence-related patterns of diagnoses. Diagnoses having a central role in the violence network were alcohol or substance abuse, pregnancy-related conditions and psychoses. These high-risk violence related patterns accounted for at most 20% of our cohort. The logistic model had good predictive accuracy and predictive power confirming that diagnosis patterns identified through the SNA are meaningful in the violence recognition. Conclusions: Routine ED data, analyzed using SNA, can be a first-line warning to recognize when an aggression related access is part of the spectrum of gender-based violence against women. Increasing the available number of predictors, such procedures may be proven to support ED staff in identifying early signs of violence to adequately support the victims and mitigate the harms.",2019-05-02,Journal,Article,BMC Public Health,19621,1,19,Social network analysis to characterize women victims of violence,1,true,10.1186/s12889-019-6797-y,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Public Health,2019.0,46.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Routine ED data, analyzed using SNA, can be a first-line warning to recognize when an aggression related access is part of the spectrum of gender-based violence against women.'}",849,144819847,M.

However,many clinicians are concerned that screeningmay be upsetting both for youths who have been exposed to trauma and for those who have not. OBJECTIVES To investigate levels of upset following routine trauma screening and whether type of trauma and symptoms of posttraumatic stress were associated with level of upset. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Survey study in which data from routine screening for trauma exposure and trauma-related symptoms were collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017. Nearly half (n = 40) of all youth mental health clinics in Norway submitted survey data. Participants included youths aged 6 to 18 years referred to treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The trauma screening inventory, Child & Adolescent Trauma Screening Questionnaire, was administered. Self-reported levels of upset after initial screening were scored on a scale ranging from 1 (not upsetting) to 7 (very upsetting). RESULTS Among 10 157 youths aged 6 to 18 years (mean [SD] age, 13.0 [3.1] years; 5320 [55.0%] female), surveyed, 8021 (79.1%) reported exposure to at least 1 potentially traumatizing event and a mean (SD) of 2.44 (2.27) different types of events (range, 0-15). Only 453 participants (4.5%) reported high levels of upset, while 2757 participants (27.2%) reported moderate levels of upset and 6942 participants (68.4%) reported no or lowlevels of upset. Youths who had been exposed to any type of traumatic event reported significantly higher levels of upset compared with those reporting no trauma exposure, and a higher number of reported traumatic eventswas associated with a higher level of upset (point estimate, 0.23; 95%CI, 0.22-0.24; P < .001). Among participants who reported trauma, exposure to sexual abuse (point estimate, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.77-0.95; P < .001) and higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (point estimate, 0.05; 95%CI, 0.04-0.05; P < .001) were associated with higher levels of upset. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A high level of trauma exposure was found among youths referred to youth mental health clinics, but trauma screening was well tolerated, with most participants reporting no or low levels of upset.

852,"© 2019The serotonergic system plays key regulatory roles in cognition and emotion. Several lines of evidence suggest that genetic variation is associated with aggressive and suicidal behaviors. Genetic studies have largely focused on three types of variations: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), and alleles. 95 published papers (49 papers for aggression and 46 for suicide) were reviewed to summarize the impact of SNPs, VNTRs, and alleles of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH, the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin [5-HT] synthesis), 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), serotonergic receptors, monoamine oxidase (an enzyme that catalyzes 5-HT degradation) on aggression and suicidal behaviors. These study samples include healthy controls, psychiatric disease patients, and animal models. This article mainly reviews studies on the relationship between 5-HT transmissions and genetic variations involved in aggression (particularly impulsive aggression) or suicide in people with different ethnicities and psychiatric disorders. We found that most SNPs, VNTRs, and alleles exerted influences on aggression or suicide. Only A128C in TPH1, A138G in 5-HT2A, and L type in the VNTR of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) affected both aggression and suicide.

853,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Psychopathy is a multifaceted construct that has been linked to aggression. Yet, few studies have explored the association between physical, verbal, and indirect aggression using the 4-facet model of psychopathy in community samples, and to date, no studies exist that test for male and female differences. The present study aimed to understand what facets of psychopathy predict aggressive behavior for men and women, while controlling for important risk factors, such as Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). Drawing from a large Bulgarian community sample (N = 565), a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the use of the 4-facet model of the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV; Hart et al.,). Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that physical aggression was predicted by affective and antisocial psychopathic traits, and ASPD. Verbal aggression was predicted by the interpersonal facet, and indirect aggression was predicted by the antisocial psychopathy facet and ASPD. Sex significantly moderated the associations among facets of psychopathy and physical and indirect aggression. Specifically, the affective facet was positively associated with physical aggression only for women, whereas the antisocial facet was positively associated with indirect aggression only for men. Results suggest that the 4-facet model of psychopathy is sensitive to capture important similarities and differences between males and females when predicting forms of aggression in community samples.

854,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Relying on an importation and deprivation framework, the study assessed a variety of risk factors associated with self-reported teacher-targeted aggression among ninth grade students (n = 5,673). Using a cross-sectional school survey conducted in one German federal state, two forms of teacher-targeted aggression were assessed: verbal (insulting, threatening, and mocking) and physical (beating and pushing) aggression. Every ninth student reported verbal aggression, while 0.5% of students reported physical aggression against teachers.

857,"© The Author(s) 2016.Whereas the majority of previous research conducted on animal abuse has been in environments where animal abuse is rarely evidenced, the current study investigated the ramifications of animal abuse in an environment wherein the national culture creates an ethos of the “social acceptability” of animal abuse in society. Two survey studies were conducted with adolescent participants, to investigate the role played by several factors in the prediction of animal abuse in this age group. In Study 1, with samples from two different national cultures (101 from Germany and 169 from Romania; 143 boys/135 girls; age 13 to 17), animal abuse was negatively associated with affective empathy and national culture; more frequent animal abuse was found in Romania. Affective empathy fully mediated the association between gender and animal abuse. Specifically, girls were found to be higher in affective empathy; in turn, participants who were higher in affective empathy committed less animal abuse. Witnessing animal abuse was also predictive of engaging in animal abuse, but not independent of national culture. In Study 2, 15-year-old males (n = 21) and females (n = 39) took part, 29 from rural and 31 from urban locations in Romania. Rural adolescents were more likely to abuse animals and had higher exposure to domestic violence, which (in turn) was associated with more animal abuse.

This study aimed to determine the incidence of these injuries over time and to explore their key socio-demographic determinants. Methods: Routinely collected coded hospital admission data for the time period 2001–2013 were used to calculate annual incidence rates by age-group, gender, geographical region, and area-based Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation using midyear population estimates. A Poisson regression analysis model was developed including the variables: age-group, gender, year, geographical region, and deprivation quintile. The data were compared with available published crime data. Results: The incidence of sharp force injury showed an ongoing decline between 2001 and 2013. The fall was greatest among young people and in the West of Scotland and mirrored the reduction in weapons and knife related offences. The relative risk of sustaining a sharp force injury was greatest for younger age-groups, among males, and in those resident in the West of Scotland and in areas of socioeconomic deprivation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of IPV, associations of socio-economic and psychosocial factors with IPV, and the association of IPV with depression and sexual behaviour, among GBMSM in the PROUD trial of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Methods: PROUD enrolled 544 HIV-negative participants in England from 2012 to 2014; participants were randomised to immediate or deferred PrEP. This analysis included 436 GBMSM who had IPV data at month-12 and/or 24. Prevalence of IPV victimization and perpetration (lifetime, and in the past year) was assessed at these time-points. Generalized estimating equations were used to investigate associations with IPV, using pooled data from both time-points. Results: At month-12 (N = 410), 44.9% of men reported ever being a victim of IPV, 15.6% in the last year, and 19.5% reported ever perpetrating IPV, 7.8% in the last year. At month-24 (N = 333), the corresponding prevalence was 40.2 and 14.7% for lifetime and past year IPV victimization and 18.0 and 6.9% for lifetime and past year IPV perpetration. IPV prevalence did not differ by randomised arm. Men reporting internalized homophobia and sexualized drug use were more likely to report IPV. Lifetime and last year experience of IPV victimization and perpetration were strongly associated with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) (adjusted for socio-demographics: Lifetime IPV victimization PR 2.57 [95% CI: 1.71, 3.86]; past year IPV victimization PR 2.93 [95% CI: 1.96, 4.40]; lifetime IPV perpetration PR 2.87 [95% CI: 1.91, 4.32]; past year IPV perpetration PR 3.47 [95% CI: 2.13, 5.64], p < 0.001 for all); IPV was not consistently associated with measures of condomless anal sex or high partner numbers.

The aim of this study was to describe SH among male and female university students and analyze the association between harassment and mental distress controlling for sexual violence. An observational survey was conducted at Trieste University (Italy). Students answered an anonymous questionnaire about harassment that included three domains—sexual harassment, gender harassment, cyber harassment—and three psychological health indicators. The global harassment index was computed, with three levels: 0, no harassment; level 1, harassment in at least one of the three domains; and level 2, harassment in two or three domains. The symptoms of mental distress were measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) for depressive symptoms; a question about panic symptoms; and a question about general health. The sample included 759 students (412 women; 18 to 29 years old). After adjustment for age, birth country, couple relationship, employment status, mother’s education, and previous sexual violence, the risk of mental distress was increased with harassment exposure. Men were affected in perceived health and depressive symptoms (GHQ score ≥ 6); women were affected in panic symptoms.

865,"© 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Background: African American patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) have demonstrated poorer methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) outcomes compared with white patients. This issue is further complicated in urban settings, where African Americans experience high rates of poverty and publicly funded treatment. Despite interrelated factors that disadvantage African Americans, the literature focusing on this population is scant. To address this shortcoming, we conducted the first investigation of gender differences and gender-specific MMT outcome predictors among African Americans (or any racial minority population). This study provides gender-specific findings to improve African American MMT outcomes. Methods: We studied 211 African American patients (male: n = 137, 64.9%) at an urban, university-affiliated MMT clinic. We used existing intake data to assess baseline demographic, substance use, mental health, and interpersonal factors. Primary outcomes were 3-month drug+ (positive) urine drug screen (UDS) results and treatment retention. Results: Women were more likely (than men) to endorse histories of interpersonal violence, substance abuse in their social network, and mental health problems. Men reported a greater likelihood (than women) for early opioid-use onset and a lack of prior MMT. There were no gender differences in 3-month drug+ UDS or treatment retention. In multivariable analyses among women, no baseline factors predicted 3-month opioid+ UDS and physical abuse history predicted a higher proportion of 3-month cocaine+ UDS. Among men, primary injection opioid use and older age best predicted a higher proportion of 3-month cocaine+ UDS and parent substance abuse predicted shorter retention. In both gender-stratified analyses, higher proportions of 3-month opioid+ UDS and cocaine+ UDS predicted shorter retention.

867,"© 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Using syndemics theory as a framework, we explored the experience of men who have sex with men in India in relation to four syndemic conditions (depression, alcohol use, internalised homonegativity and violence victimisation) and to understand their resilience resources. Five focus groups were conducted among a purposive sample of diverse men along with seven key informant interviews with HIV service providers. Participants’ narratives suggested various pathways by which syndemic conditions interact with one another to sequentially or concurrently increase HIV risk. Experiences of discrimination and violence from a range of perpetrators (family, ruffians and police) contributed to internalised homonegativity and/or depression, which in turn led some men to use alcohol as a coping strategy.

869,"© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Occupational Hygiene Society.Background and context: The correctional environment exposes registered nurses to unique occupational health hazards including, but not limited to, an increased risk for workplace violence. Gender role expectations regarding femininity and masculinity may influence occupational exposures and outcomes differently. Risk comparisons between male and female registered nurses working in correctional settings, have been minimally examined. With the proportion of male registered nurses working in corrections higher than that of nurses working in other healthcare sectors, and with the increasing number of males entering the nursing workforce in general, it is important to characterize and understand occupational exposures and outcomes of male and female registered nurses, especially those working in correctional settings. Purpose/objectives: This paper aims to describe and compare sex and gender role differences in occupational exposures and work outcomes among correctional registered nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey using Qualtrics was administered to registered nurses working in a northeastern correctional healthcare system between June and October 2016. The survey was composed of 71 items from the CPH-NEW Healthy Workplace All Employee Survey, Assessing Risk of Exposure to Blood and Airborne Pathogens and General Health Survey, Bem Sex Role Inventory-Short Form (BSRI-SF), and the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised. Results: Of 95 registered nurse participants, 75% were female with the highest percentage identified as belonging to the feminine group (37%), while the highest percentage of male participants were identified as belonging to the androgynous group (33%). Females worked primarily on the first shift, while males tended to work the second and third shifts (P < 0.05). Over one third of all participants (37%) reported having experienced a sharps-related injury and having been exposed to blood-borne pathogens and body fluids within the previous 2-5 years. The majority of the participants (>95%) reported being at risk for workplace violence and having been victims of workplace violence perpetrated by an inmate. Significant gender differences (P < 0.0001) were noted in the bullying exposure with androgynous nurses having higher occasional bullying. There was a marginal difference in burnout for females (M = 6.8, SD = 2.1) and males (M = 5.8, SD = 1.9, P = 0.05).

However, there are persisting inequities and barriers to sport participation that can prevent children and young people with diverse backgrounds and abilities from accessing these benefits. This mixed methods study investigated how diversity is understood, experienced and managed in junior sport. The study combined in-depth interviews (n = 101), surveys (n = 450) and observations over a three-year period. The results revealed that a focus on performance and competitiveness negatively affected junior sports clubs’ commitment to diversity and inclusive participation. Gender and a range of attitudes about diversity were also strongly related. On average, we found that those who identified as men were more likely to support a pro-performance stance, be homophobic, endorse stricter gender roles, and endorse violence as a natural masculine trait. In addition, those who identified as men were less likely to hold pro-disability attitudes.

Materials and Methods: Electronic medical records of 185 patients referred to the IPV support program from the emergency department (ED) between January 2015 and October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 555 subjects (1:3 ratio of IPV victims to control subjects) who presented to the ED. Reports of all imaging studies performed within 5 years prior to the index ED visit were reviewed. Results: The majority of patients who experienced IPV (mean age, 34.2 years 6 12.2 [standard deviation]) were female (178 of 185 [96.2%]) and were largely African American (69 of 185 [37.3%]). Demographic and clinical variables independently associated with IPV were race (odds ratio [OR] range, 3.2–5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8, 12.7), psychiatric comorbidities (OR, 5.4; 95% CI: 3.4, 8.8), and homelessness (OR, 13.0; 95% CI: 5.4, 31.2).

The addition of imaging findings to demographic and clinical variables increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the multivariate model to detect IPV (0.87 vs 0.86, P , .01), and the cross-validated multivariate model had an AUC of 0.85. Acute fractures involved the face or skull (range, P , .01 to P = .05), and chronic fractures affected the extremities and nasal bone (P , .01 and P = .05, respectively) more frequently in the IPV group than in the control group.

This study explored causes and consequences of unintended pregnancies among women in the Gaza Strip. Methods This was a qualitative study, and included 21 women who had experienced unintended pregnancies previously. Data collection took place in three focus groups of 5-12 participants, which were facilitated by one female researcher. Structured questions on reasons for, causes and impact of unintended pregnancies were answered by all participants. Sessions were audiotaped and responses were transcribed and read by all the researchers to extract themes. Results The mean age of participants was 34.2±6.0 years, parity was 2.7±0.6 and 16 participants (76.2%) had benefitted from secondary level education or above. Five main themes were identified: (1) economic hardship was the main reason for pregnancies to be unwanted; (2) high pressure was exerted on women for male babies, exposing women to gender-based violence; (3) advanced maternal age was perceived as a social stigma; (4) complete lack of support for women facing unintended pregnancy led to self-management of terminations including attempts of unsafe methods; and (5) changes of methods and incorrect use leading to contraceptive failure was the most frequent cause.

874,"© 2019Background: This study aimed to develop a predictive model to quantify the risk of student harmful drinking associated with emergency department (ED) visits and/or campus-wide incidents reported to campus authorities in a U.S. public university. Methods: Six-year (2010/11–2015/16) student enrollment data were linked to subsequent harmful drinking events defined as either alcohol intoxication associated with ED visits or alcohol-related incidents reported to authorities within 1 year following the annual (index) enrollment. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk predictive model based on the first 3-year student cohort (n = 93,289), which was then validated in the following 3-year student cohort (n = 85,876). Results: A total of 2609 students in the derivation cohort and 2617 students in the validation cohort had at least 1 harmful drinking event within 1 year following the index enrollment, providing an incidence of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. Student demographics (gender, age, ethnicity, parental tax dependency), academic level, Greek life member, transfer students, first-time enrolled students, having been diagnosed with depression or injury, and violence involvement were statistically significant predictors. C-statistics of the model were 0.86 in both cohorts, with excellent calibration and no evidence of over- or under-prediction observed from calibration plots.

875,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.Police use of force is an important public health issue in the US. Recent high-profile incidents suggest a potential link between mental disorders and police use of force, however little research has examined their co-occurrence in the general population. We aimed to assess the overall association between specific mental and substance use disorders (MSUDs) and nonfatal legal intervention injury. We identified nonfatal legal intervention injury cases (n = 90,099) and MSUD diagnoses from all hospital and emergency department (ED) records in California between 2005 and 2014. Age-, sex-, and race-standardized MSUD prevalence estimates among legal intervention injury cases, stratified by inpatient status, were compared to general US population-based estimates from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Compared to the general US population, nonaffective psychoses, mood disorders, alcohol use disorders, and drug use disorders were substantially overrepresented among inpatient legal intervention injuries (prevalence difference [PD]: 19.2%, (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.0, 20.4); PD: 15.3%, (95% CI: 13.9, 16.7); PD: 21.1%, (95% CI: 19.8, 22.4); PD: 29.7%, (95% CI: 28.4, 31.0), respectively). Associations for all except mood disorders were similar but attenuated among ED injury cases. In contrast, anxiety disorders were underrepresented in both inpatient and ED injury cases. Results for mood disorders and suicidal ideation were mixed.

All rights reserved.OBJECTIVES: A blended training programme combining residential meetings (de visu) and distance training course (DTC) have been developed in order to provide the key elements for prevention, individuation, and care of women victims of violence. DESIGN: The Project involved the identification and testing of a systematic methodology of blended training addressed to social and health operators of 28 Emergency Room (ER) Units in 4 Italian regions (Lombardy – Northern Italy, Lazio – Central Italy, Campania and Sicily – Southern Italy). Tuscany region (Central Italy) collaborated through experts in the field from the Grosseto Task Force. This training approach specifically aimed to increase the professional competences for diagnosis, management and treatment of gender-based violence, as well as to strengthen multidisciplinary territorial networks against violence. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In this Project, 28 ERs in the four Italian regions mentioned above were selected because of their involvement in managing gender-based violence. This selection was performed by a coordinator, one for each region, who also coordinated the recruitment of personnel to be involved in the training programme. The programme has therefore been proposed to social and health operators and police officers in the ERs recruited. In each ER, two referents were identified (a doctor and a nurse) in order to ensure a constant connection between the course participants and the experts involved in the management of the Project and the DTC platform. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of the increase of knowledge relatively to gender-based violence issue in the ER professionals who have concluded the blended training programme. A systematic analysis and comparison of all accesses concerning women aged ≥14 years in the period 1 July- 31 December 2014 (before the blended training programme) and in the period 1 July-31 December 2016 (after the blended training program). RESULTS: Among the 866 registered professionals, 636 participants (73.5%) completed the course, 202 (23.3%) professionals did not complete it, 21 (2.4%) did not pass the certification test, and 7 (0.8%) participated as Auditors. Among the participants who completed the course, most of them (70.8%) were females; the average age was 45 for both males and females. The most represented professional role was the nurse (61%), followed by the medical doctor (27.2%). Based on our data, in the post-training period, an increased number of cases of violence were correctly recorded in comparison to the pre-training period. CONCLUSION: The Project allowed to define a training strategy for health professionals of the ERs who respond daily to the health needs of women who are victims of violence. The blended training programme combining residential meetings (de visu) and distance training course has been developed in order to provide the key elements for prevention, individuation, and care of women victims of violence.

Trans women conducted 74 structured interviews with other trans women in El Salvador, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, and Haiti in 2016. We conducted qualitative applied thematic analysis to understand the nature and consequences of GBV and transphobia and descriptive quantitative analysis to identify the proportion who experienced GBV in each context. A high proportion experienced GBV in education (85.1%), healthcare (82.9%), from police (80.0%), and other state institutions (66.1%). Emotional abuse was the most common in all contexts and included gossiping, insults, and refusal to use their chosen name. Participants also experienced economic, physical, and sexual violence, and other human rights violations based on their gender identity and expression. At school, participants were physically threatened and assaulted, harassed in bathrooms, and denied education. In healthcare, participants were given lower priority and received substandard care. Healthcare workers and police blamed participants for their health and legal problems, and denied them services. From police, participants also experienced physical and sexual assault, theft, extortion for sex or money, and arbitrary arrest and detention. Participants had difficulty obtaining identification documents that matched their gender identity, sometimes being forced to alter their appearance or being denied an identification card. Service providers not only failed to meet the specific needs of trans women but also discriminated against them when they sought services, exacerbating their economic, health, and social vulnerability. Although international and regional resolutions call for the legal protection of transgender people, states do not meet these obligations.

The purpose of this article was to examine the role of sociodemographic factors (gender, age, grade, school achievement, mother’s and father’s education level and income, and socioeconomic status of the family) contributing to different engagement of children in peer violence. A total of 715 seventh- and eighth-grade students, aged between 12 and 15 years, from five regions of the Republic of Croatia participated in this study. A descriptive analysis showed that the majority of children perceived themselves in the role of defenders, then bystanders, victims, reinforcers, active assistants, and fewest perceived themselves in the role of bullies. A correlation analysis showed that bullies, assistants, and bystanders were more often boys, while girls were more often defenders. Both genders were equally victims of peer violence. Seventh-grade students were more inclined to be bullies. A regression analysis conducted for each role showed that different sociodemographic factors predicted different engagement of children in peer violence.

886,"© 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.INTRODUCTION: In the past five years, researchers have increasingly turned to the study of mental health outcomes in LGBT populations. The present paper summarizes recent literature on the relationship between minority stress experienced by sexual minorities and mental health. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PsycINFO, PubMed, and the EBSCO Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection were searched for papers concerning minority stress and mental health disparities in LGBT populations, published between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2018. All collected papers were screened using the following criteria: study involving >50 individuals; written in English; focusing on clinical outcomes of depression, suicidality, and substance use in relation to experienced minority stress. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Sixty-two papers were included in this review. Findings are reported under three main headings: studies primarily focused on depression, studies concerning suicidality and suicide attempts, and papers analyzing the correlation between substance use and minority stress in LGBT populations. The included studies supported the minority stress model as a framework to better explain disparities in mental health outcomes in sexual minority populations. Higher rates of depression, suicidality, and substance use are reported in LGBT populations, as are the related minority stressors analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minorities still face numerous mental health disparities. Research indicates that the levels of minority stressors positively predict mental health outcomes. Specific policies designed to support the civil rights of sexual minorities may help to overcome such inequalities.",2019-03-01,Journal,Review,Minerva Psichiatrica,33651,64,60,Minority stress and mental health among LGBT populations: An update on the evidence,2,,10.23736/S0391-1772.18.01995-7,Edizioni Minerva Medicasubscriptions.dept@minervamedica.it,Minerva Psichiatrica,2019.0,80.0,3.0,,886,51126818,F.

888,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdBackground: Childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) and intimate partner violence victimization (IPV) is prevalent among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (LGB). Identification of distinct patterns of childhood and adult victimization, including technology-mediated and face-to-face IPV, and their cumulative relations to mental/behavioral health challenges, among LGB people is needed to facilitate identification of at-risk individuals. Objective: Using latent class analysis, we first sought to identify patterns of lifetime interpersonal victimization, primarily five types of CAN and IPV in LGB emerging adults. Second, we examined if LGB-status and race/ethnicity predicted class-membership; third, we assessed differences between the latent classes on emotion dysregulation, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and alcohol use. Participants: Participants were 288 LGB adults between 18–29 years (M = 25.35, SD = 2.76; 41.7% gay/lesbian) recruited via Amazon MTurk. Methods and results: The 3-step LCA identified five-latent classes: high victimization, childhood emotional abuse and neglect, cybervictimization, adult face-to-face IPV, and lower victimization. People of color (including Hispanics) were more likely to be in the high victimization class, and bisexual individuals, especially bisexual women, in the childhood emotional abuse and neglect class. High victimization and childhood emotional abuse and neglect classes had elevated emotion dysregulation levels and depression and anxiety symptoms, and the high victimization class reported the highest levels of alcohol use.

The current study explores the relationships between the overall amount of time spent with video games and time spent with games that contain violence with beliefs that emerging adults hold about masculine gender role norms. In a sample of 244 young adult video game players from across the United States, amount of perceived violence in favorite games is shown to predict scores on the Masculine Role Norms Index-Revised and some of its subscales, even under multiple controls.

892,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Epidemiological research suggests an interrelationship between mental health problems and the (re)occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV). However, little is known about the impact of mental health treatments on IPV victimization or perpetration, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Methods: We conducted a systematic review to identify prospective, controlled studies of mental health treatments in LMIC. We defined 'mental health treatment' as an intervention for individuals experiencing mental ill health (including substance misuse) including a substantial psychosocial or pharmacological component. Studies had to measure a mental health and IPV outcome. We searched across multi-disciplinary databases using a structured search strategy. Screening of title/abstracts and full-text eligibility assessments were conducted by two researchers independently, data were extracted using a piloted spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was generated. Results: We identified seven studies reported in 11 papers conducted in five middle-income countries. With the exception of blinding, studies overall showed acceptable levels of risk of bias. Four of the seven studies focused on dedicated mental health treatments in various populations, including: common mental disorders in earthquake survivors; depression in primary care; alcohol misuse in men; and alcohol misuse in female adult sex workers. The dedicated mental health treatments targeting depression or alcohol misuse consistently reduced levels of these outcomes. The two studies targeting depression also reduced short-term IPV, but no IPV benefits were identified in the two alcohol-focused studies. The other three studies evaluated integrated interventions, in which a focus on substance misuse was part of efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and violence against particularly vulnerable women. In contrast to the dedicated mental health interventions, the integrated interventions did not consistently reduce mental ill health or alcohol misuse compared to control conditions. Conclusions: Too few studies have been conducted to judge whether mental health treatments may provide a beneficial strategy to prevent or reduce IPV in LMIC. Key future research questions include: whether promising initial evidence on the effects of depression interventions on reducing IPV hold more broadly, the required intensity of mental health components in integrated interventions, and the identification of mechanisms of IPV that are amenable to mental health intervention.",2019-02-14,Journal,Review,BMC Women's Health,19499,29,19,Can mental health treatments help prevent or reduce intimate partner violence in low- and middle-income countries?

893,"© 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.Considerable research has documented the seriousness of Intimate Partner Sexual Violence, which has been found to affect Aboriginal women disproportionally. In addition, rates of intimate homicides are five times higher for Aboriginal women than non-Aboriginal women. Intimate Partner Sexual Violence tends to have a particular capacity to attack the identity of victimized women because of the multiple forms of violence experienced at the same time. This study investigated the nature of violence experienced by a current or former intimate partner. Participants were adult females who identified as Aboriginal Australians. Findings indicated high levels of sexual victimization and potentially lethal violence. Aboriginal women reported to have been subjected to threats to kill, attempts of strangulation, having been threatened with a weapon, and frequent forced sexual intercourse. Fear and anger appeared to explain women’s resistance against the experienced violence.

Despite this questioning, throughout history there was men who have positioned themselves against sexism and gender violence, in favor of affective or emotional/sexual or sexual relations, totally free of violence. This article is developed through an auto narrative of a case of overcoming sexual harassment thanks to the interaction and masculine intervention in support and solidarity to the victims of gender-based violence. The narrative is evidenced with the scientific contributions of the main feminist researchers on the new masculinities' topic.

895,"© 2019 World Psychiatric AssociationA timely determination of the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prerequisite for efficient service delivery and prevention. We provide a risk estimate tool allowing a calculation of individuals’ PTSD likelihood from early predictors. Members of the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) shared individual participants’ item-level data from ten longitudinal studies of civilian trauma survivors admitted to acute care centers in six countries. Eligible participants (N=2,473) completed an initial clinical assessment within 60 days of trauma exposure, and at least one follow-up assessment 4-15 months later. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) evaluated PTSD symptom severity and diagnostic status at each assessment. Participants’ education, prior lifetime trauma exposure, marital status and socio-economic status were assessed and harmonized across studies. The study's main outcome was the likelihood of a follow-up PTSD given early predictors. The prevalence of follow-up PTSD was 11.8% (9.2% for male participants and 16.4% for females). A logistic model using early PTSD symptom severity (initial CAPS total score) as a predictor produced remarkably accurate estimates of follow-up PTSD (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.976). Adding respondents’ female gender, lower education, and exposure to prior interpersonal trauma to the model yielded higher PTSD likelihood estimates, with similar model accuracy (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.941). The current model could be adjusted for other traumatic circumstances and accommodate risk factors not captured by the ICPP (e.g., biological, social). In line with their use in general medicine, risk estimate models can inform clinical choices in psychiatry.

Therefore, we compared 78 adult outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with (n = 24) or without (n = 54) experiences of physical violence in childhood. Background data were collected with questionnaires, and total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured from fasting blood samples. Patients with a history of childhood physical violence had lower levels of TC than the control group. No differences were observed in HDL-C, LDL-C, or low-grade inflammation levels between the two groups. In multivariate models, decreased levels of TC were associated with childhood physical violence, and these associations remained significant after adjustments for age, gender, lifestyle, metabolic condition, socioeconomic situation, psychiatric status, suicidality, low-grade inflammation, the chronicity of depression, medications used and somatic diseases. At the 8-month follow-up, the results were essentially the same when the Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) was used as the measure of ACEs.

The results indicated that maltreated children were at increased risk of arrest for nonviolent and violent crime. Higher verbal intelligence, reading ability, nonverbal reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were protective against arrest for violent crime.

The Counting Dead Women Australia (CDWA) campaign is a femicide census counting violent deaths of women in Australia from 2014. We conducted a cross-sectional in-depth review of CDWA cases Jan-Dec 2014 to establish evidence of antecedent factors and describe femicide in Australia. Victim (n = 81) and perpetrator (n = 83) data were extracted from the CDWA register, law databases and coronial reports. Mixed methods triangulation of socio-demographic and incident characteristics. Women ranged in age from 20 to 82 years of age (44 ± 15.4). There were 83 perpetrators, of which 13 were unknown (not yet apprehended). Known perpetrators (n = 70) ranged in age from 16 to 72 years of age (40 ± 12.7) and 89% were male (62/70). The location of the crime was most frequently the victim’s home (49/70). In cases where the relationship between the victim and perpetrator was known (n = 59), over half of femicides were committed by intimate-partners (33/59). Intimate-partner perpetrators were more likely to have a history of violence and commit murder-suicide than other perpetrators. Femicide is overwhelmingly perpetrated by males, with women most vulnerable in their own home and with their intimate partners. Furthermore, intimate-partner femicide is associated with modifiable risk factors, including previous violence and mental health issues, which represents opportunities for early intervention within healthcare settings as practitioners are well-placed to identify risk and provide support.

901,"© The Author(s). 2019.Background: Dating and relationship violence (DRV)-intimate partner violence during adolescence-encompasses physical, sexual and emotional abuse. DRV is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes including injuries, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancy and mental health issues. Experiencing DRV also predicts both victimisation and perpetration of partner violence in adulthood. Prevention targeting early adolescence is important because this is when dating behaviours begin, behavioural norms become established and DRV starts to manifest. Despite high rates of DRV victimisation in England, from 22 to 48% among girls and 12 to 27% among boys ages 14-17 who report intimate relationships, no RCTs of DRV prevention programmes have taken place in the UK. Informed by two school-based interventions that have shown promising results in RCTs in the USA-Safe Dates and Shifting Boundaries-Project Respect aims to optimise and pilot a DRV prevention programme for secondary schools in England. Methods: Design: Optimisation and pilot cluster RCT. Trial will include a process evaluation and assess the feasibility of conducting a phase III RCT with embedded economic evaluation. Cognitive interviewing will inform survey development. Participants: Optimisation involves four schools and pilot RCT involves six (four intervention, two control). All are secondary schools in England. Baseline surveys conducted with students in years 8 and 9 (ages 12-14). Follow-up surveys conducted with the same cohort, 16 months post-baseline. Optimisation sessions to inform intervention and research methods will involve consultations with stakeholders, including young people. Intervention: School staff training, including guidance on reviewing school policies and addressing 'hotspots' for DRV and gender-based harassment; information for parents; informing students of a help-seeking app; and a classroom curriculum for students in years 9 and 10, including a student-led campaign. Primary outcome: The primary outcome of the pilot RCT will be whether progression to a phase III RCT is justified. Testing within the pilot will also determine which of two existing scales is optimal for assessing DRV victimisation and perpetration in a phase III RCT. Discussion: This will be the first RCT of an intervention to prevent DRV in the UK.

More than one-third of the IPSA offenders were serial sex offenders; that is, the offenders sexually assaulted an intimate partner and another person(s). Comparing IPSAs to all other sexual assaults, IPSAs more frequently involved bodily force, less frequently involved a weapon, and IPSA investigations were more frequently closed because (1) the victims stated they lied or the police doubted the victims and (2) the victims declined to prosecute. The most common sequencing of events was a demand for sex by the offender followed by a verbal refusal by the victim and the use of bodily force in the sexual assault. The findings, however, indicate a great deal of variation in the sequencing of events surrounding the sexual assault, with over 25% involving no physical confrontation before or after the sexual assault and no demands for sex.

Methods: Three hundred forty-five white code cases data reported between January 2016 and December 2018 at University of Health Sciences, Bakırkoy Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. These reports were evaluated in terms of age, gender, occupational information, department (emergency, ward, outpatient clinic), type of violence (verbal, physical, verbal and physical) and the time at which the event occurred. Results: Between January 2016 and December 2018, 345 cases of violence were reported through the white code. When these violent events are classified as verbal, physical, verbal and physical, 312 verbal violence, 31 verbal and physical violence and 2 physical violence cases have been reported. In the analysis of 345 violent incidents; 218 (63.18%) female and 127 (36.81) male healthcare workers were exposed to violence. 71.88% (n=248) of those who were exposed to violence were doctors and 20.86% (n=72) were nurses.

Aim: Examination of data from patients treated in the Addictological Out-patient Clinic in Józsefváros and deceased between 2001 and 2018. Method: Patients' data originated from medical records. The national and Budapest data were from the publications of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. Results: The age of patients was 52.85 ± 11.81 years for women and 51.99 ± 12.47 years for men. Two-thirds, regardless of gender, were alcoholic. There were many violent deaths. A new phenomenon was the high number of drug- and murder-associated deaths. The former group was dominated by men. The latter group showed female dominance. The completed suicide rate was 14.6%. Suicide attempts occurred in 22.4% of patients. The majority of patients were skilled workers. Conclusion: Data support the view that addict patients die earlier. Leading deaths, unlike previous investigations, were violent deaths.

914,"© 2019 American Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.Objectives: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase risk of adult behavioral health conditions. State legislators are an important audience to target with evidence about ACEs because they make policy decisions that can prevent ACE exposure and enhance resilience. This study sought to describe state legislators' opinions about ACEs as risk factors for adult behavioral health conditions and identify how opinions vary between legislators with different characteristics. Methods: A multimodal survey was conducted in 2017 (response rate, 16.4%; N=475). Dependent variables were the extent to which legislators thought that four ACEs-sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, and childhood neglect-increase risk of adult behavioral health conditions. Independent variables were legislator characteristics (e.g., ideology and gender). Rao-Scott chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were conducted. Results: Childhood sexual abuse was identified as a major risk factor by the largest proportion of respondents (77%), followed by childhood physical abuse (59%), witnessing domestic violence (39%), and childhood neglect (38%). The proportion identifying each ACE as a major risk factor was significantly higher among Democrats than among Republicans, liberals than among conservatives, and women than among men. For example, 56% of liberals identified witnessing domestic violence as a major risk factor, compared with 29% of conservatives (p,.001).

This complexity is worsened by the acceptance of Sexual Violence within a patriarchal society, harmful traditional and cultural practices, breakdown of law and order especially during electoral periods, all heightened by abject poverty. There are numerous programs on interventions costing millions in local and foreign currency, however grave gaps still exist at key levels across all sectors even after years of continued intervention. The overall lack of specialist forensic knowledge required to strengthen key service provision contributes to the rise of many parallel and poor quality approaches.

917,"© 2019 Open Public Health Journal. All rights reserved.Background: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive form of Violence Against Women (VAW). IPV has been acknowledged as a human rights violation and a public health problem. Years of research and advocacy have led to a better understanding of the problem including the development of the ecological model for explaining IPV. Although diverse international policies and global advances in women’s rights have contributed to addressing IPV, the problem still persists. IPV is associated with adverse health outcomes, therefore, its prevention is an important aspect of population health promotion. Objective: Considering that doctoral research and theses form an integral aspect of knowledge production, the present study aims to provide a review of doctoral theses on IPV at a Swedish university in order to identify areas of unmet need for future IPV prevention studies. Methods: A search was conducted to identify IPV related thesis stored in the Karolinska Institutet (KI), which is a database where all publications produced at KI are stored. A total of thirteen PhD theses (the earliest published in 2004 and the latest in 2017) met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Results: Through their wide range of contexts and contents, these theses provide a global insight into IPV. Findings show that prevalence estimates and risk factors at the individual and relationship levels are well researched. Potential areas of unmet needs include the under-researched nature of risk factors and interventions at the community and societal level as well as underlying issues preventing the healthcare sector from actively playing its role in addressing IPV. Conclusion: Capacity building for the health sector and addressing community and societal level risk factors of IPV are modifiable factors to address IPV and improve population health.",2019-01-01,Journal,Article,Open Public Health Journal,19700201625,0,12,Doctoral theses as a source of knowledge production for IPV prevention: A literature review of doctoral theses at a swedish university,1,true,10.2174/1874944501912010145,Bentham Science PublishersP.O.

All rights reserved.Through the intersectionality of a feminist approach and a phenomenological lens, this article examines groups of women who use social media to enact resistance against street harassment, derogatory expressions against women, piropos, and “locker room talk.” The analysis focuses on the project “#Ropasucia” by writers/artists Maricela Guerrero, Paula Abramo, and Xitlali Rodríguez Mendoza, who conceived a project that forcibly identifies-by employing a public stage such as the Internet-how a perpetrator's remarks obligate women to react and share their experiences. The artists then interpreted their project's results using large-scale artistic installations exhibiting interior clothing and soap. In the project “No me llamo mamacita; arte vs. acoso callejero,” we explore how illocutionary forces combat verbal violence/harassment in public and semi-public spaces in the nation's capital, Mexico City, as well as how catcalling not only affects self-esteem but translates to increased statistics of violence in both public and private spaces. In viewing violent assaults and aggression as phenomenological events, we discuss how artists convert language, “dirty laundry” (undergarments), soap, drawings, and posters into tools for writing the human, women experience as a phenomenon of a response against verbal violence. Connecting these artistic works to others similar in nature across the world, we demonstrate the global trend of women rising in resistance.",2019-01-01,Journal,Review,Revista de Estudios Hispanicos,16100154786,0,53,"#RopaSucia and no me llamo mamacita.

921,"© World Health Organization (WHO) 2019.Background: Violence against women is a global phenomenon. Aims: To estimate and forecast cognizable crime against women in New Delhi, India, from 2016 to 2020. Methods: Reported cognizable crime against women in New Delhi for 2009-2015 was extracted for statistical analysis, synthesis and modelling. The cognizable crimes reported are rape, attempt to commit rape, kidnapping and abduction, dowry deaths, assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty, insult to modesty of women, cruelty by husband or his relative, importation of girls from foreign countries, abetment of suicide of women and indecent representation of women. Results: The actual number of registered cases of crime against women ranged from 4251 (2009) to 17 104 (2015).

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.Violence against women is now regarded as a gender-based violence and recognized as a violation of human rights and a serious social problem of epidemic proportions, both by different international organisms and by governments in a growing number of countries. According to this consideration, studies for the analysis and characterization of this violence should place gender as a central category of analysis (i.e., they should be gender-specific or, at least, gender-sensitive). However, despite this, not a few scientific texts and papers continue to be written from what has been termed gender blindness.

927,"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The present commentary explores the impact of gender role stereotypes on perceptions of both intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. Two papers published in this issue of Sex Roles explored the influence of gender stereotypes on both IPV (Bates et al. 2019) and rape myths (Klement et al. 2019). An overarching theme of these papers is how gender stereotypes may influence incorrect beliefs in how we view and approach interventions to these two types of violence. Reflecting on this convergence, we have come together as authors to consider how influential and damaging these stereotypes can be to victims of both partner violence and sexual violence. Our paper considers the nature of these stereotypes, who is harmed by them considering both gender and sexuality, and also the impact they have in societal and service responses to violence, as well as policy and practice development.",2019-01-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,22,,The Impact of Gendered Stereotypes on Perceptions of Violence: A Commentary,2,,10.1007/s11199-019-01029-9,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,Sex Roles,2019.0,104.0,0.0,,927,50020722,E.

928,"© 2019, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. All rights reservedCyber violence on the Web: New forms of disciplinary rhetoric against feminism Cyber violence against women and girls is emerging as a global problem. The increasing cases of feminist YouTubers suffering online harassment prove that this kind of aggression intensifies when the victim is a woman and a feminist. This paper aims to explore the scope and strategies of antifeminist cyber violence embedded within the YouTube comment section. In order to achieve the research goal, this work draws from a case study: the comments on the video Why I’m… a feminist, posted by the American YouTuber Laci Green (2014). A qualitative content analysis is undertaken of these comments, whose interpretation takes as a reference Cole’s theory (2015) based on Foucault’s model of disciplinary rhetoric (1975). According to the results, “insult”, “sarcasm”, “imposition”, “wish to hurt”, “sexual objectification”, “criminalization/ defamation” and “threat” (both general and sexually explicit) constitute coercion mechanisms that are systematically applied to silence feminist women. Likewise, the misconception of feminism, that is, the advocacy of a mistaken and stereotyped version of this concept, represents a common pattern with high potential to promote future situations of cyber violence. The progressive normalization of cyber violence against women and girls requires an urgent response. In addition to measures of social awareness, a more rigorous online regulation would be essential for ensuring the predominance of respect and empowerment instead of violence and discrimination in the virtual world.",2019-01-01,Journal,Article,Papers,5600153108,3,104,Cyber violence on the Web: New forms of disciplinary rhetoric against feminism Ciberviolencia en la red.

HIV prevention cascades have been proposed to assist in the implementation and monitoring of HIV prevention programmes by identifying gaps in the steps required for effective use of prevention methods, similar to HIV treatment cascades. However, absence of a unifying framework impedes widespread use of prevention cascades. Building on a series of consultations, we propose an HIV prevention cascade that consists of three key domains of motivation, access, and effective use in a priority population. This three step cascade can be used for routine monitoring and advocacy, particularly by attaching 90-90-90-style targets. Further characterisation of reasons for gaps across motivation, access, or effective use allows for a comprehensive framework that guides identification of relevant responses and platforms for interventions.

930,"© 2018 Michigan Association for Infant Mental HealthResearch is increasingly documenting a neurobiological basis to violence. This review takes a neurodevelopmental perspective on the very small group of males who grow up to become persistent violent offenders. After outlining six criteria for what constitutes a neurodevelopmental disorder, the extent to which chronic violence meets these definitional criteria is examined, covering the fields of genetics, structural and functional brain imaging, and neuropsychology. Early health risk factors for violence are then outlined, including birth complications, minor physical anomalies, prenatal smoking and alcohol exposure, poor nutrition, lead exposure, and traumatic brain injury. Persistent adult violence is argued to originate in aberrant temperamental behavior in early childhood, to have a stable developmental trajectory, and to be associated with impaired education, social, and occupational functioning. Taken together, it is argued that chronic adult violence meets criterion for being conceptualized as having neurodevelopmental origins and that an important, but not sole, source of neural maldevelopment lies in prenatal and early postnatal risk factors. This review concludes with a recognition of the sociopolitical context within which a neurodevelopmental perspective on chronic violence sits, together with directions for future research, including whether a neurodevelopmental hypothesis is best applied to reactive as opposed to proactive aggression.",2019-01-01,Journal,Article,Infant Mental Health Journal,15031,12,40,A neurodevelopmental perspective on male violence,0,false,10.1002/imhj.21761,John Wiley and Sons Inc.P.O.Box 18667NewarkNJ 07191-8667,Infant Mental Health Journal,2019.0,87.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is argued that chronic adult violence meets criterion for being conceptualized as having neurodevelopmental origins and that an important, but not sole, source of neural maldevelopment lies in prenatal and early postnatal risk factors.'}",930,4891029,A.

Participants were a racially diverse college sample of self-identified heterosexual men (N = 104) between the ages of 18–35. Men completed a measure of hegemonic masculinity and engaged in a laboratory paradigm in which they and three male confederates watched a female confederate, who reported a strong dislike of sexual content in the media, view a sexually explicit film which they could stop at any time. Prior to the woman viewing the film, participants were randomly assigned to a peer norm manipulation wherein the male confederates set a misogynistic or ambiguous norm. Results indicated the presence of a misogynistic peer norm decreased the likelihood and speed of intervention. Among men exposed to misogynistic, compared to ambiguous, peer norms, men who strongly endorsed the status male role norm were less likely to display prosocial bystander behavior. Findings indicate that exposure to peers who sexually objectify and disrespect women decreases prosocial bystander intervention.

933,"© 2018 The AuthorsSuicide is a devastating public health issue that imposes severe psychological, social, and economic burdens not only for the individuals but also for their relatives, friends, clinicians, and the general public. Among the different suicidal behaviors, suicide completion is the worst and the most relevant outcome. The knowledge of biological etiopathological mechanisms involved in suicide completion is limited. Hitherto, no objective markers, either alone or in combination, can reliably predict who will complete a suicide. However, such parameters are strongly needed to establish and optimize prediction and prevention. We introduce here a novel ideation-to-completion framework in suicide research and discuss the problems of studies aiming at identifying and validating clinically useful markers. The male gender is a specific risk factor for suicide, which suggests that androgen effects are implicated in the transition from suicidal ideation to suicide completion. We present multiple lines of direct and indirect evidence showing that both an increased prenatal androgen load (with subsequent permanent neuroadaptations) and increased adult androgen activity are involved in suicide completion. We also review data arguing that modifiable maternal behavioral traits during pregnancy contribute to the offspring's prenatal androgen load and increase the risk for suicide completion later in life. We conclude that in utero androgen exposure and adult androgen levels facilitate suicide completion in an synergistic manner. The androgen model of suicide completion provides the basis for the development of novel predictive and preventive strategies in the future.",2019-01-01,Journal,Review,Progress in Neurobiology,24025,32,172,The androgen model of suicide completion,1,true,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2018.06.003,Elsevier Ltd,Progress in neurobiology,2019.0,360.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is concluded that in utero androgen exposure and adult androgen levels facilitate suicide completion in an synergistic manner and provides the basis for the development of novel predictive and preventive strategies in the future.'}",933,2315744,B.

941,"© The Author(s) 2018.Objective: In South Africa, Black African women between the ages of 15 and 24 years are especially vulnerable to HIV. The heterosexual transmission of the disease is exacerbated by social and cultural conditions that perpetuate gender relations of inequality. Problematic conceptualisations of femininity increase sexual risk. The objective of this article is to examine the ways in which undergraduate university Black African female students make meaning of gender and sexuality on campus and the social processes through which femininities are produced. Design: Qualitative research study. Setting: University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Method: In total, 10 in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 25 Black African undergraduate female students aged between 18 and 24 years old. Results: Campus life was conceived as a place of heterosexual freedom, sexual enjoyment and engagement with dating relationships. Relationships were forged based on romantic notions of love and versions of femininity based on trust lead to sexual risk and unwanted pregnancy. In the context of material inequalities, ‘sugar daddy’ relationships further limited female students’ ability to negotiate safe sex. The overall climate on campus was structured along gender power inequalities. Female students feared and were victims of verbal, physical assault and sexual coercion. The lack of campus security exacerbated female students’ vulnerability to violence on campus.

943,"© 2018, The Author(s).Background: Sexual assault is a worldwide problem that has not yet been sufficiently acknowledged as confirmed by the literature. Italian law n.96, 1996, foreseeing norms regarding rape and sexual abuse, finally gave significant relevance to sex crimes. In 2004, the European Commission for Justice Internal Affairs and Social Politics promoted the Daphne II program to support victims of rape and abuse, and the Violence and Operative Healthcare Networks (Ve.R.S.O.) project started at the Policlinico “P. Giaccone” University Hospital of Palermo in 2006. Aim: data analysis emerging from 10 years experience of Daphne protocol utilization for the management of sexual assault victims. Methods: From October 2006 since December 2016 a total of 90 victims of sexual assault were retrospectively investigated. Patients are divided into groups in relation to: gender, age, place of SA, number and type of assailant, nature of sexual assault, presence/absence of physical or genital injuries. Results: Among victims 88 were females (97%) and 2 males (3%); 68 Italians (75.5%) and 22 foreigners (24.5%). At the time the events occurred, 42% (n = 38) of the victims were minors aged less than 16 years. In 11 cases, the age of the victim is not indicated. The assailant was an acquaintance of the victim in 65% of the cases (in 73% of these cases, the assailant was a family member). In 26 cases (28%) happened indoor, 44 cases happened outdoor and in 20 cases there were no data. Evidence of recent acute general body trauma (abrasions, bruises, lacerations) was found in 38 cases (42%); other types of injuries include: genital trauma (14 cases, 15%), genital and body traumas (49 cases, 54%) (tab. 1–2-). In 24 cases (26%) there were no injuries. Among genital trauma, we distinguished vulvo-vaginal lesions (68.5%) and anal lesions (31.5%). We have classified the minor victims using first Adam’s classification and based on Adam’s classification revised in 2015. Conclusion: Application of the Ve.R.S.O project protocol changed and greatly improved health management of victims of violence. By following these procedures, violence and abuse are analyzed from every point of view, also for an appropriate assessment of the medium and long term health consequences of sexual assault.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Theoretical studies propose an association between family violence and low self-control in adolescence; however, empirical findings of this association are inconclusive. The aim of the present research was to systematically summarize available findings on the relation between family violence and self-control across adolescence. We included 28 studies with 143 effect sizes, representing more than 25,000 participants of eight countries from early to late adolescence. Applying a three-level meta-analysis, taking dependency between effect sizes into account while retaining statistical power, we examined the magnitude and direction of the overall effect size. Additionally, we investigated whether theoretical moderators (e.g., age, gender, country), and methodological moderators (e.g., time lag between family violence and self-control, informant) influenced the magnitude of the association between family violence and self-control. Our results revealed that family violence and self-control have a small to moderate significant negative association (r = −0.191). This association did not vary across gender, country, and informants. The strength of the association, however, decreased with age and in longitudinal studies. This finding provides evidence that researchers and clinicians may expect low self-control in the wake of family violence, especially in early adolescence.

945,"Copyright © 2018 by the American Psychosomatic SocietyObjective: Sexual assault (SA) is associated with an increased risk for chronic pain and affective distress. Given that emotional processes modulate pain (e.g., negative emotions enhance pain, positive emotions inhibit pain), increased pain risk in SA survivors could stem from a disruption of emotional modulation processes. Methods: A well-validated affective picture-viewing paradigm was used to study emotional modulation of pain in 33 healthy, pain-free SA survivors and a control group of 33 healthy, pain-free individuals with no reported history of SA (matched on age, sex, race, and number of non-SA traumas). Unpleasant (mutilation), neutral, and pleasant (erotic) pictures were presented, while painful electrocutaneous stimulations were delivered at the ankle. Pain intensity ratings and nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) magnitudes (a physiologic measure of spinal nociception) were recorded in response to electric stimuli. Multilevel models were used to analyze the data with group (SA versus non-SA) and content (mutilation, neutral, erotic) as independent variables. Results: Both groups demonstrated similar emotional modulation of pain (FGroupbyContent(2,646.52) = 0.44, p = .65), but a main effect of group (FGroup(1,65.42) = 4.24, p = .043) indicated the SA group experienced more overall pain from electric stimuli (hyperalgesia). A significant group by content interaction for NFR (p = .035) indicated that emotional modulation of NFR was present for the non-SA group (FContentSimpleEffect(2,684.55) = 12.43, p < .001), but not the SA group (FContentSimpleEffect(2,683.38) = 1.71, p = .18). Conclusions: These findings suggest that SA survivors have difficulty emotionally engaging brain-to-spinal cord mechanisms to modulate spinal nociception. A disruption of descending inhibition plus hyperalgesia could contribute to comorbidity between sexual trauma and chronic pain.",2018-11-01,Journal,Article,Psychosomatic Medicine,19172,8,80,Emotional Modulation of Pain and Spinal Nociception in Sexual Assault Survivors,2,,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000567,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,Psychosomatic Medicine,2018.0,72.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Findings suggest that SA survivors have difficulty emotionally engaging brain-to-spinal cord mechanisms to modulate spinal nociception.'}",945,6164027,N.

However, little is known about their knowledge and understanding of this issue. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the perceptions of different groups of healthcare workers toward elder abuse in Japan, using the Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) model. Home-visit nurses, medical doctors, care managers, care workers, public health nurses, and social workers, with experience of dealing with elder abuse received self-administered questionnaire surveys that inquired regarding demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding elder abuse. A total of 311 healthcare workers participated in this survey. To compare the differences among the groups, a one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test, and a Kruskal-Wallis with posthoc Steel-Dwass tests were used in accordance with data normality. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore variables that predicted the healthcare workers' perceptions, and covariance structure analysis was used to examine whether the KAB model can accurately predict healthcare workers' perceptions. Multiple comparisons showed significant differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding elder abuse among the abovementioned six groups. Age, sex, and years of work related to the care of elderly were extracted as significant determinants of healthcare workers' perceptions of elder abuse. The examination of the KAB model with covariance structure analysis yielded a model with strong goodness-of-fit. These findings emphasize the need to take effective measures to improve their perceptions as well as review the role of each healthcare worker so that they can be more concerned with and involved in the safeguarding of the elderly. Given the strong goodness-of-fit demonstrated by the KAB model, education of healthcare workers on both the knowledge of, and attitudes toward, elder abuse may help in improving healthcare workers' behavior in dealing with elder abuse.",2018-11-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,20,13,Comparison of perceptions of domestic elder abuse among healthcare workers based on the Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) model,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0206640,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,PLoS ONE,2018.0,42.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Given the strong goodness-of-fit demonstrated by the KAB model, education of healthcare workers on both the knowledge of, and attitudes toward, elder abuse may help in improving healthcare workers’ behavior in dealing with elder abuse.'}",946,51171243,Q.

All rights reserved.What diagnostic criterion is noted to be a central feature for each of the diagnoses of intellectual disability, borderline personality disorder, and gender dysphoria? A. Functional impairment. B. Emotional instability. C. Cognitive dysfunction. D. Neurotic traits. ""Ms. A"" is a 23-year-old transgender woman (assigned male at birth) with a history of fetal alcohol syndrome, mild intellectual disability (a full-scale IQ of 60), and borderline personality disorder. She received primary care and support through a regional intellectual disability agency but was also well known to psychiatric services for frequent violent outbursts and recurrent self-harm gestures. Ms. A's interactions with the mental health system began before age 5. She was adopted at birth into a home with other special-needs siblings. Early records reflect her difficulty with impulse control and anger management. By age 8, she was frequently wearing makeup or girls' clothing. By age 16, she consistently identified as female, wearing articles of women's clothing at school and soliciting her sisters' boyfriends. She made frequent self-harm gestures, such as cutting herself in the school hallway as well as threatening suicide, and she occasionally responded with violence toward peers or siblings who taunted her. During adolescence, Ms. A used social networking sites to find potential dates, often meeting older men in dangerous situations. Her high-risk behaviors continued; she often threatened ""to turn myself into a girl"" with knives, and she asked a man to ""rape and kill me."" By age 23, she had more than 15 referrals to mental health crisis units for behavioral issues, typically leading to inpatient hospitalizations. Despite support in her gender identity by her adoptive mother, she was unable to find services that provided hormone or surgical transition services for transgender youths and therefore had not received either intervention. Her main social service provider for intellectual disability also did not provide resources for transgender youths. Police last brought Ms. A to our facility after she threatened herself with scissors when a peer referred to her as a boy. She appeared tall and thin, looked younger than her age, and had a speech impediment with a significant lisp. She also exhibited dysmorphic facial features consistent with fetal alcohol syndrome, shoulder-length blonde hair, and faint beard growth. She frequently hunched over, hiding her face in her hands or behind her hair. She moved awkwardly and frequently missed social cues, unintentionally provoking anger from peers on the inpatient unit. On admission, Ms. A wore pink pajama pants and a loose-fitting T-shirt. She commonly wore pink T-shirts with adolescent slogans during her stay. She usually engaged readily and eagerly with staff and peers, but she was often childish in her mannerisms, consistent with intellectual disability Throughout her stay, she displayed limited frustration tolerance and frequently responded to misidentification of her gender with dramatic displays of emotion. Staff was unsure how to address Ms. A. Some were outwardly hostile. On one occasion, a staff member was overheard saying, ""I'm not going to call that a she."" Documentation from Ms. A's previous contacts with service agencies revealed unfamiliarity with transgender terminology and frequent dismissal of her transgender status. Of 15 intake notes, only two referred to her gender with correct pronouns; others documented male pronouns; some used both male and female pronouns; one avoided mentioning gender altogether. One writer noted, ""He is trying to be transgender."" Others frequently put the transgender modifier in quotation marks. Ms. As treatment team made several attempts to change her recorded gender on her hospital identification to prevent misidentification on subsequent admissions. Although gender misidentification was a trigger for many of her admissions, this was rarely included as part of her treatment plan. Most inpatient treatment focused on bolstering coping mechanisms before discharging her to the care of her service agency. The issue of her transgender status was often unaddressed, sometimes even actively avoided. Ms. A was unable to be discharged back to her adoptive mother's house. She and her mother sought a group home placement through the intellectual disability regional services. However, the local group homes were gender segregated, and the homes for females would not accept Ms. A, who often looked like a young man. Meetings between the family, the mental health team, and intellectual disability regional services revealed no known housing resources in the area that would meet her gender, intellectual, and mental health needs.",2018-11-01,Journal,Article,American Journal of Psychiatry,17664,3,175,A transgender woman with intellectual disability and borderline personality disorder,0,false,10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17121349,American Psychiatric Association,American Journal of Psychiatry,2018.0,0.0,0.0,,947,31992785,W.

948,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe WHO defines health not as the absence of disease but as a “state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.” To date, public health research on sanitation has focused mainly on the impact of sanitation on infectious diseases and related sequelae, such as diarrhea and malnutrition. This review focuses on the mental and social well-being implications of sanitation. We systematically searched leading databases to identify eligible studies. Qualitative studies were assessed using a 17-point checklist adapted from existing tools, while quantitative studies were assessed using the Liverpool Quality Appraisal Tool. We followed a best-fit framework synthesis approach using six a priori well-being dimensions (privacy, shame, anxiety, fear, assault, and safety), which were examined using line-by-line coding. Two additional dimensions (dignity and embarrassment) inductively emerged during coding for a total of eight well-being outcomes. We then synthesized coded text for each dimension into descriptive themes using thematic analysis. For quantitative studies, we extracted any measures of association between sanitation and well-being. We identified 50 eligible studies covering a variety of populations and sanitation contexts but many studies were conducted in India (N = 14) and many examined the sanitation experience for women and girls (N = 19). Our synthesis results in a preliminary conceptual model in which privacy and safety, including assault, are root well-being dimensions. When people perceive or experience a lack of privacy or safety during open defecation or when using sanitation infrastructure, this can negatively influence their mental and social well-being. We found that perceptions and experiences of privacy and safety are influenced by contextual and individual factors, such as location of sanitation facilities and user's gender identity, respectively.

Living in countries with higher gender equality, with anti-GV legislation prior to 2005, in countries where the state involved multiple actors in GV response and in countries with family policies included in the Anglo-Saxon, Eastern European and Southern European typologies (reference: Nordic), diminishes the women likelihood of suffering IPV.

950,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdObjectives: This study aimed to understand if maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (IPV-PTSD) is associated with delayed language development among very young children (“toddlers”). Methods: Data were collected from 61 mothers and toddlers (ages 12–42 months, mean age = 25.6 months SD = 8.70). Child expressive and receptive language development was assessed by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) communication subscale (ASQCS) that measures language acquisition. Observed maternal caregiving behavior was coded from videos of 10-min free-play interactions via the CARE-Index. Correlations, Mann-Whitney tests, and multiple linear regression were performed. Results: There was no significant association between maternal IPV-PTSD severity and the ASQCS. Maternal IPV-PTSD severity was associated with continuous maternal behavior variables (i.e. sensitive and controlling behavior on the CARE-Index) across the entire sample and regardless of child gender. Maternal sensitivity was positively and significantly associated with the ASQCS. Controlling behavior was negatively and significantly associated with the ASQCS. Conclusions: Results are consistent with the literature that while maternal IPV-PTSD severity is not associated with child language delays, the quality of maternal interactive behavior is associated both with child language development and with maternal IPV-PTSD severity.

951,"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.We investigate women’s and men’s willingness to engage in action on behalf of women, and we identify two distinct categories of behavior: action that aims to challenge gender inequality (feminist action) and action that aims to protect women from violence (protective action). Three online studies were conducted. For each study, a U.S. community sample was recruited. In Study 1 (n = 602), women reported greater intentions to engage in feminist action than men did. Men, however, were just as willing as women to participate in protective action. In Study 2 (n = 726), we replicated these gender differences and found that protective action was positively predicted by benevolent sexism among men. In Study 3 (N = 582), we investigated why women reported greater intentions to engage in feminist action compared to men. We found that women were more aware of gender inequality, which was associated with identification as a feminist, and through this, intentions to engage in feminist action. Awareness of gender inequality also predicted intentions to engage in protective action among women. Men, however, were less aware of gender inequality, which was associated with the belief that feminist action leads to women having more rights than men do and subsequently greater willingness to participate in protective action.

953,"© 2018 Racionero-Plaza, Ugalde-Lujambio, Puigvert and Aiello.Violence in sexual-affective relationships among teens and young people is recognized as a social, educational, and health problem that has increased worldwide in recent years. Educational institutions, as central developmental contexts in adolescence, are key in preventing and responding to gender violence through implementing successful actions. In order to scientifically support that task, the research reported in this article presents and discusses a psycho-educational intervention focused on autobiographical memory reconstruction that proved to be successful in raising young women's critical consciousness about the force of the coercive discourse upon sexual-affective experiences and memories. We examined among a sample of young women (n = 32, age range 17-30) whether reading a scholarly text about love, the Radical Love book, modified autobiographical memories of violent sexual-affective relationships in line with preventing future victimization. This group was compared with a control group (n = 31, age range 17-30). Memory reports were collected before and after the reading and coded to analyze their content, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Memory quality features were assessed with the Memory Quality Questionnaire (MMQ). A focus group was also conducted to examine the personal impact of the intervention on participants. Compared with controls, the experimental group had stronger critical memories (of episodes involving violence), an average decrease in positive emotions induced by recall, and an average increase in negative emotions. The results show the effectiveness of the reading intervention designed in relation to gender violence prevention, as they indicate the ability of the psycho-educational action to debilitate the force of the coercive discourse in young women's memories. The findings both advance knowledge on the reconstructive nature of autobiographical memories of violent sexual-affective relationships in female youth and indicate the potential of memory-based interventions as an instrument to prevent and reduce gender violence in school contexts. Teachers and teaching staff, and educational psychologists, among others, can benefit from these results by expanding the tools they have to address gender violence among female adolescents and youth.",2018-10-24,Journal,Article,Frontiers in Psychology,21100216571,26,9,Reconstruction of autobiographical memories of violent sexual-affective relationships through scientific reading on love: A psycho-educational intervention to prevent gender violence,1,true,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01996,Frontiers Media S.A.info@frontiersin.org,Frontiers in Psychology,2018.0,112.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results show the effectiveness of the reading intervention designed in relation to gender violence prevention, as they indicate the ability of the psycho-educational action to debilitate the force of the coercive discourse in young women’s memories.'}",953,1405218880,Sandra Racionero-Plaza,1422661526,Leire Ugalde-Lujambio,7140125,Lídia Puigvert,35700138,Emilia Aiello,,,,,25.0,111.0,6.0,1.0,22.0,1.0,56.0,1055.0,18.0,24.0,186.0,9.0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Medicine"

Men were also found to consume more frequently ecstasy, cocaine, mushrooms, amphetamine, LSD, codeine and ketamine (all p < 0.0001) for pleasure and novelty seeking, group effect, but also alleviating anxiety, sedative and stimulant effect and stress before exam (all p < 0.001) while women were more frequently followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist (aOR = 2.0 [1.7–2.3],p < 0.0001), consumed more frequently anxiolytics (aOR = 1.6[1.3–1.9], p < 0.0001) and antidepressants (aOR = 1.4[1.1–1.9], p = 0.01), reported lower rates of physical and mental quality of life in all subscores (all p < 0.0001). They were more frequently exposed to sexual assault (aOR = 4.1 [2.5–6.9], p < 0.0001) and domestic violence (aOR = 1.6[1.1–2.5], p = 0.02) while men were more frequently exposed to physical assault (aOR = 0.4[0.4–0.5], p < 0.0001) during their medical studies. Conclusions: Medical students are mostly women. While men and women are both exposed to professional and personal stress with differences, men are more frequently involved in addictive behavior and psychoactive substance consumption while women are mostly followed-up by psychiatrist and/or psychologist and psychotropic drug consumers, with more impaired self-reported mental and physical quality of life scores.

The resultant case law, culminating in the US Supreme Court case Brown v. EMA (2011), demonstrated court skepticism of the science linking violent games to harm in minors. Such skepticism was increasingly confirmed as numerous newer studies could not link violent games to socially relevant outcomes. In more recent years, there has been a newer focus on sexist games and the harm these might cause. This field appears at risk for repeating some of the problems of the violent game field, including exaggeration of mixed findings, lack of curiosity regarding null findings, and unreliable research designs.

956,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: Street children are forced to spend a lot of time away from their homes and some of them do not have homes at all, due to economic and family problems, which makes them exposed to many health problems, such as the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Iran, like many other countries in the world, experiences the burden of street children, however, the rate of HCV among street children is virtually unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran. Main body: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The study protocol of this review was registered in PROSPERO under identification term CRD42018082336. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify published studies reporting on the prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran. Several international scholarly databases, including Web of Science, PubMed®/MEDLINE®, Embase, Scopus®, Google Scholar and Directory of Open Access Journals, as well as Iranian databases such as MagIran and Barakathns were searched. Studies published between 1988 and December 2017 with any of the following keywords were selected: (street OR homeless OR labour) AND (children OR child OR infant) AND (hepatitis C OR hepatitis C virus OR HCV OR viral hepatitis OR hepatitis OR hepacivirus) AND Iran. Moreover, a grey literature search was performed in order to obtain other potentially relevant studies. The search was carried out without any language restrictions. Four studies, surveying a total of 1691 street children, conducted between 2006 and 2017 were found to be eligible for inclusion in the review and therefore analysed. Three studies were conducted in Tehran and one in Isfahan. The prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran was found to be high, at 2.4% (95% CI: 1.8-3.3). Conclusions: Since the prevalence of HCV among street children in Iran is quite high, health decision- and policy-makers should pay more attention to street children and widen support channels, both social and economic. Further studies should be conducted among street children in different cities of Iran to add to the knowledge base of HCV among street children in the country.

958,"© The Author(s) 2016.Research investigating intimate partner violence (IPV) among sexual minorities is limited. The research that does exist has found that rates of IPV are similar to or higher than the rates found for heterosexual women, the most commonly studied population in this area. This limited research has resulted in a dearth of prevention/intervention programs targeted for these populations. While some may argue that existing IPV programs can be used for these populations, this review presents an argument for more targeted work with sexual minority populations, using young men who have sex with men (YMSM) as an example. Drawing on the framework of intersectionality, this article argues that the intersectionality of age, sexual identity, and gender combines to create a spectrum of unique factors that require specific attention. This framework allows for the identification of known correlates for IPV as well as factors that may be unique to YMSM or other sexual minority populations.

No systematic review has yet identified the predictors and consequences in this vulnerable population of childhood abuse, exposure to sibling abuse and domestic violence, and sibling aggression. This systematic review aims to (a) describe differences in these family victimization rates by sexual orientation, gender, and race/ethnicity; (b) identify potential sexual minority and non-sexual minority-specific risk factors; and (c) identify physical, mental, and behavioral health and extrafamilial victimization correlates. The systematic review, which followed PRISMA guidelines, yielded 32 articles that met study inclusion criteria. Rates of childhood physical, sexual, and emotional abuse were consistently higher for sexual minority youth than for their heterosexual peers. Bisexual youth appear to be at greater risk for physical abuse than their gay and lesbian peers. Younger age at sexual minority milestones (first awareness, disclosure, and same-sex sexual contact) and higher levels of sexual minority-specific (sexuality disclosure, gender non-conformity) and non-sexual minority-specific (delinquent behaviors, parental drinking) risk factors were associated with higher rates of family victimization. Sexual minorities who experienced some form of childhood abuse reported more frequent physical (higher rates of HIV, higher BMIs, lower levels of perceived health), mental (higher rates of depression, PTSD symptoms, experiential avoidance, internalized homophobia), and behavioral (higher rates of suicidality, substance misuse, earlier sexual debut, unprotected anal sex) health problems relative to heterosexual or non-abused sexual minority peers. Sexual minority females who experienced childhood physical or sexual abuse were at greater risk than abused sexual minority males for sexual assault later in life.

960,"© The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2018.Background Interpersonal violence is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The strength and population effect of modifiable risk factors for interpersonal violence, and the quality of the research evidence is not known. Aims We aimed to examine the strength and population effect of modifiable risk factors for interpersonal violence, and the quality and reproducibility of the research evidence. Method We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of risk factors for interpersonal violence. A systematic search was conducted to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses in general population samples. Effect sizes were extracted, converted into odds ratios and synthesised, and population attributable risk fractions (PAF) were calculated. Quality analyses were performed, including of small study effects, adjustment for confounders and heterogeneity. Secondary analyses for aggression, intimate partner violence and homicide were conducted, and systematic reviews (without meta-analyses) were summarised. Results We identified 22 meta-analyses reporting on risk factors for interpersonal violence. Neuropsychiatric disorders were among the strongest in relative and absolute terms. The neuropsychiatric risk factor that had the largest effect at a population level were substance use disorders, with a PAF of 14.8% (95% CI 9.0–21.6%), and the most important historical factor was witnessing or being a victim of violence in childhood (PAF = 12.2%, 95% CI 6.5–17.4%).

961,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdPregnancy termination is a common, beneficial medical procedure, but abortion care in the United States is stigmatized. Language, including categorization of some abortions as elective, may both reflect and convey stigma. We present a history of the term “elective” in reference to abortion, followed by data demonstrating its use by a sample of contemporary medical trainees and an analysis of the term's relationship to abortion stigma, medical training, and patient access to abortion care. We analyzed interviews with 41 U.S. medical students who had applied to residency programs in obstetrics and gynecology. Participants discussed experiences with, and attitudes toward, abortion before and during medical school, and plans to perform abortions in future practice. We inductively coded participants’ use of “elective” in reference to abortion and analyzed their meanings. Participants did not use “elective” according to its medical definition, which conveys an absence of urgency for surgery. Instead, “elective” identified a subset of abortions that lacked maternal or fetal medical indications. “Elective” negatively marked and isolated some abortions, and participants used the term to convey judgment about patients’ social and reproductive histories. Participants saw medical and psychosocial indications as mutually exclusive, and became confused when interrelated factors influenced patients’ abortion decisions. They ignored the voluntary nature of abortion in the setting of medical illness, sexual violence, or fetal complications, and accepted discrimination against women seeking abortion for psychosocial indications as normal and ethical. The term “elective” enables the creation and perpetuation of abortion stigma, and contributes to a hidden curriculum for abortion training in medical education that distracts from core content, incorporates social judgment of patients into medical practice, and promotes normative gender concepts.

963,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Gender-based violence (GBV) is common among female sex workers (FSWs) and is associated with multiple HIV risk factors, including poor mental health, high-risk sexual behavior, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Prior studies have focused on GBV of one type (e.g. physical or sexual) or from one kind of perpetrator (e.g., clients or regular partners), but many FSWs experience overlapping types of violence from multiple perpetrators, with varying frequency and severity. We examined the association between lifetime patterns of GBV and HIV risk factors in 283 FSWs in Mombasa, Kenya. Patterns of GBV were identified with latent class analysis based on physical, sexual, or emotional violence from multiple perpetrators. Cross-sectional outcomes included depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, disordered alcohol and other drug use, number of sex partners, self-reported unprotected sex, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in vaginal secretions, and a combined unprotected sex indicator based on self-report or PSA detection. We also measured HIV/STI incidence over 12 months following GBV assessment. Associations between GBV patterns and each outcome were modeled separately using linear regression for mental health outcomes and Poisson regression for sexual risk outcomes. Lifetime prevalence of GBV was 87%. We identified 4 GBV patterns, labeled Low (21% prevalence), Sexual (23%), Physical/Moderate Emotional (18%), and Severe (39%). Compared to women with Low GBV, those with Severe GBV had higher scores for depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and disordered alcohol use, and had more sex partners. Women with Sexual GBV had higher scores for disordered alcohol use than women with Low GBV, but similar sexual risk behavior. Women with Physical/Moderate Emotional GBV had more sex partners and a higher prevalence of unprotected sex than women with Low GBV, but no differences in mental health. HIV/STI incidence did not differ significantly by GBV pattern.

Using prospective, self-report data collected yearly from 413 mother–child dyads (210 mother–son dyads and 203 mother–daughter dyads) between child ages 12–17, the results indicate that the effect of maternal depressive symptoms on daughters’ depressive symptoms steadily increases throughout adolescence whereas the effect of maternal depressive symptoms on sons’ depressive symptoms is relatively small, stable, and non-significant during mid-adolescence before increasing in effect in later adolescence. A positive interactive effect between maternal depressive symptoms and intimate partner violence is observed for sons and maternal depressive symptoms and substance use for daughters. A negative interactive effect of maternal depressive symptoms and substance use is observed among sons. Overall, this study identifies particular subgroups for whom intervention programming is most beneficial and suggests targeting health risk behaviors of mothers to lessen the impact of maternal depressive symptoms on offspring.",2018-10-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,25680,6,47,"Intergenerational Continuity in Depression: The Importance of Time-Varying Effects, Maternal Co-morbid Health Risk Behaviors and Child’s Gender",2,,10.1007/s10964-017-0805-2,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,2018.0,126.0,0.0,,966,7997675,M.

The objective of this study was to compare male and female prisoners from Singapore on rates of IPV as well as the Johnson (2006) types of IPV. Women (n = 75) self-reported higher rates of physical IPV perpetration in the past year (64.0%) than (n = 75) did men (46.1%). Women reported similar rates of IPV for themselves and their partners in the past year (64.0%), while men reported slightly more physical IPV for themselves (46.1%) than they did for their female partners (41.3%). In line with Johnson (2006), rates of intimate terrorism were calculated between 5% and 7% for themselves and their partners, with little variation due to gender. Violent resistance (VR) was calculated at between 2.1% and 7%, with more female than male VR reported for women. Much higher rates of situational couple violence was calculated for both males and females, ranging from 53.3% to 66.7% in the past year, while mutual violent control was significantly lower, ranging from between 14.8% to 20.0%, with data being discussed in relation to patriarchal and family violence perspectives.

973,"Copyright © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) are at high risk for gender-based violence (GBV) and HIV infection. This study aimed to identify associations between GBV exposure in the past 12 months and biomarkers of physiologic stress and inflammation that may play a role in increased HIV risk among Kenyan FSWs. Materials and Methods: Participating women responded to a detailed questionnaire on GBV and mental health. Plasma was collected for assessment of systemic C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Hair proximal to the scalp was collected to measure cortisol concentration. CRP and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and hair cortisol concentration was determined by enzyme immunoassay. Log-transformed biomarker values were compared across GBV exposure categories using Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Multivariable linear regression was used to explore associations between recent GBV and hair cortisol concentration. Results: Two hundred eighty-three women enrolled, of whom 112 (39.6%) reported physical, sexual, or emotional violence in the past 12 months, 134 (47.3%) reported more remote exposure, and 37 (13.1%) reported no exposure. CRP and IL-6 levels did not differ across groups (p = 0.57 and p = 0.62, respectively). Among 141 women who provided hair, cortisol concentrations were higher among recently exposed women compared to the other two groups combined (p = 0.02). In multivariable regression, recently exposed women had higher hair cortisol levels than remotely exposed or unexposed women (adjusted beta = 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.02-1.02, p = 0.04). Conclusions: While CRP and IL-6 levels did not differ by GBV category, recent GBV was associated with increased hair cortisol concentration.

974,"© The Author(s) 2018.Feminist identity is a powerful predictor of activism on behalf of women. However, little is known about how feminist identity develops worldwide, either in terms of social identity theory or the stage model of feminist identity development. Moreover, some women’s movement advocates view feminism with suspicion, as focused only on concerns of a narrow group of women. For this study, 45 women’s movement activists from China, India, Nicaragua, Poland, and the United States were interviewed as part of the Global Feminisms Project. Participants’ personal narratives were examined to identify themes activists used to describe their own feminist identity development. The six themes that emerged were education, social relationships, gender-based injustice, violence, activism, and emotion. Alternating least squares analysis of the concurrence of these themes revealed four pathways to feminist identity: (1) education, (2) social relationships and gender-based injustice, (3) violence, and (4) activism and emotion. These findings suggest that individuals come to feminist identity in different ways. Instructors aiming to encourage understanding of women’s movement activism should point to these different pathways, and feminist activists seeking to promote feminist identity development should consider different approaches to successfully engaging people.

A public health approach to combating HT has been advocated. Such an approach seeks to prevent HT by engaging diverse stakeholder groups in addressing risk factors at multiple levels. As a key stakeholder group, health care professionals (HCPs) play a critical role in HT prevention.

As educators, advocates, and researchers, HCPs may collaborate across sectors to implement community- and society-level prevention strategies. Such strategies may include enhancing awareness of HT through education; advocating for local and national policies that promote community health and wellness; combating social or cultural norms that contribute to HT; and building a strong evidence-base to guide future HT prevention programs.

976,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdBackground: Gender-based violence is a worldwide major public health issue with detrimental effects on the health of women. Nurses can play an essential role in its identification, management and prevention. Specific training is essential to be able to successfully address gender-based violence and accordingly, has been incorporated into many university's training programmes for nurses and other health care professionals. Research aimed at exploring attitudes and perceptions of gender-based violence in undergraduate student nurses following these new training programmes is scarce. Objective: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore third- and fourth-year nursing students' perceptions and attitudes toward gender-based violence. Design: A focus groups based qualitative study. Setting: A public University in Spain. Participants: Purposive sample of 42 nursing students who joined 7 focus groups. Methods: Focus groups discussions following a semi-structured interview guide. Discussions were transcribed and analysed following critical discourse analysis to identify interpretative repertoires. Results: From the analysis, three interpretative repertoires emerged. The first, ‘Gender-based violence is something serious’, reflected participants' acknowledgment of the social relevance of this type of violence. The second interpretative repertoire, ‘Men are defenceless!’, related to the perception that national legislation on gender-based violence was discriminatory to men and the perception of a lack of social sensitisation toward intimate partner violence against men. The last one, ‘Trained to address gender-based violence but still unprepared’ encompassed participants' confidence in their ability to identify gender-based violence but uncertainty as to how to respond to gender-based violence exposed women in terms of professional practice.

977,"© 2018 American Psychological Association.Objective: Among men who have sex with men (MSM), HIV sexual risk and poor self-care behavior is associated with syndemics, or co-occurring psychosocial problems. Though prior research has demonstrated an additive total effect of syndemics on HIV risk behavior and infection, mostly within cross-sectional designs, it is possible that these associations are not direct but rather that syndemics disrupt relevant individual-level mediating psychological variables. One of the more common individual-level psychological variables that predicts health behavior generally, and HIV risk behavior specifically, is self-efficacy. This study sought to examine the potential effects of syndemics on condomless sex via condom-use self-efficacy as an intermediary variable. Method: In high-risk MSM (N = 197), across 3 time points (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) we used latent growth curve modeling to test the degree to which self-efficacy mediated the relationship between syndemics (heavy alcohol use, substance use disorder, sexual compulsivity, depression, social anxiety, intimate partner violence, childhood sexual abuse) and condomless anal sex. Results: The baseline analyses were consistent with an indirect effect of the association between syndemics and condomless sex through self-efficacy. Prospective longitudinal mediation was partially supported, such that baseline syndemics were associated with lower baseline self-efficacy, which in turn predicted higher increases in condomless anal sex across time. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary evidence (due to the partial support for the longitudinal model) that syndemics themselves may not be directly causal in their association with condomless sex, but the association may be through modifiable social- cognitive mechanisms such as condom self-efficacy.",2018-09-01,Journal,Article,Health Psychology,14277,26,37,Condom-use self-efficacy as a mediator between syndemics and condomless sex in men who have sex with men (MSM),1,true,10.1037/hea0000617,American Psychological Association Inc.journals@apa.org,Health Psychology,2018.0,52.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Preliminary evidence is provided that syndemics themselves may not be directly causal in their association with condomless sex, but the association may be through modifiable social–cognitive mechanisms such as condom self-efficacy.'}",977,4545487,S.

We test a series of hypotheses about the role of sex, foreign contact, ritual access, and temporal shifts, in the patterning of cranial trauma in this cemetery. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-seven crania from Coyo Oriental were analyzed using standard bioarcheological methods to determine sex and age as well as the presence of cranial fractures. We also documented the presence of Tiwanaku goods, objects tied to warfare or hunting, camelid offerings, snuff paraphernalia, and items related to mining. Results: We recorded 98 cranial fractures in the sample with 94.9% (93/98) on the anterior of the cranium. No significant differences are observed in the prevalence of trauma by sex, type of grave, or date. However, Coyo Oriental's trauma prevalence is two to three times higher than other Middle Period sites. Conclusion: The prevalence and location of these injuries suggest that conflict at Coyo Oriental, while of the same nature, was at a scale different to that seen elsewhere in the oases.

979,"© 2017 American Psychological Association.Objective: To examine the assumption of measurement invariance across sexes from one representative instrument that uses subscale scores to represent the latent construct intimate partner abuse (IPA). Method: Extant data were used to investigate measurement invariance across sexes with one screening measure of IPA, the Relationship Behavior Rating Scale. This particular measure was used in the current study for the purpose of illustrating the need to investigate measurement equivalence as a standard procedure for all instruments measuring IPA when comparisons across sexes are made. IPA was measured in a sample of 1,654 divorcing individuals mandated to mediation for custody and parentingtime disputes. Results: Although a multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence that the same 5-factor latent model of IPA (coercive controlling behaviors, psychological abuse, physical abuse, threats and escalated violence, and sexual abuse) is measured in men and women, the assumption that an analogous pattern of observed variables contribute to each of the 5 subcategories of IPA was not supported. Exploratory analyses suggest that items measuring threatened and escalated violence and sexual abuse may be a source of such variance across sexes.

981,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: Young men in South Africa face concurrent epidemics of HIV, drug and alcohol abuse, and unemployment. Standard HIV prevention programs, located in healthcare settings and/or using counseling models, fail to engage men. Soccer and vocational training are examined as contexts to deliver male-specific, HIV prevention programs. Methods: Young men (n=1200) are randomly assigned by neighborhood to one of three conditions: 1) soccer league (n=400; eight neighborhoods); 2) soccer league plus vocational training (n=400; eight neighborhoods); or 3) a control condition (n=400; eight neighborhoods). Soccer practices and games occur three times per week and vocational training is delivered by Silulo Ulutho Technologies and Zenzele Training and Development. At baseline, 6months, 12months, and 24months, the relative efficacy of these strategies to increase the number of significant outcomes (NSO) among 15 outcomes which occur (1) or not (0) are summed and compared using binomial logistic regressions. The summary primary outcome reflects recent HIV testing, substance abuse, employment, sexual risk, violence, arrests, and mental health status. Discussion: The failure of men to utilize HIV prevention programs highlights the need for gender-specific intervention strategies. However, men in groups can provoke and encourage greater risk-taking among themselves. The current protocol evaluates a male-specific strategy to influence men's risk for HIV, as well as to improve their ability to contribute to family income and daily routines. Both interventions are expected to significantly benefit men compared with the control condition.",2018-08-03,Journal,Article,Trials,4700151726,8,19,Gender-specific HIV and substance abuse prevention strategies for South African men: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,1,true,10.1186/s13063-018-2804-3,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,Trials,2018.0,81.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The current protocol evaluates a male-specific strategy to influence men’s risk for HIV, as well as to improve their ability to contribute to family income and daily routines.'}",981,1382468834,M.

Structured searches were conducted in nine bibliographic databases (March 2016). Study identification, critical appraisal (using the CASP tool), and analyses (thematic synthesis) were conducted. 46 qualitative studies were selected. Three main themes were identified: 1) Defining violence against women and its causes; 2) Awareness of violence against women and disclosure, with subthemes: 2.1.) Barriers experienced by primary care providers; 2.2) Facilitators for providing appropriate help; 3) Actions taken by providers to help women. Violence against women was generally considered as an unacceptable act with important health consequences. Barriers to address violence against women included organizational factors, providers’ subjective feelings and perceived role, and providers’ perceptions about women facing violence against women. Facilitators included a trusting relationship with women, attentive non-judgmental listening, participate in the community, team-work and continuing education.

983,"© The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2018.Objective: People affected by schizophrenia spectrum disorders are at a higher risk of offending violently. This study aims to investigate risk factors in relation to the peri-diagnostic period and possible predictors of post-diagnostic violence of people diagnosed for the first time in the public mental health system. Methods: The study compared various risk factors for post-diagnostic violence in patients (n = 1453) diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Patients were grouped according to the occurrence of peri-diagnostic violence. Of the 246 violent offenders, 164 committed their first offence pre-diagnosis. Mental health and criminological variables were evaluated across the lifespan (median age at end of follow-up = 34.22 years, range = 17.02–55.80 years). Results: Gender, employment, non-violent offending, family incidents, violent and non-violent victimisation, substance use, personality disorder, number of in-patient admissions and history of non-compliance differed significantly across violent and non-violent subgroups (all p ⩽ 0.01 and at least small effect size). More frequent and longer inpatient admissions were found in the violent subgroups (all p ⩽ 0.01). For the whole sample, sex, number of violent offences, non-violent offences, violent victimisation, substance use and number of inpatient admissions predicted post-diagnostic violence (χ2 (6) = 188.13, p < 0.001). Among patients with a history of pre-diagnostic violence, a history of non-violent offending in the 18-month period pre-diagnosis was the strongest predictor of future violence (odds ratio = 3.08, 95% confidence interval [1.32, 7.21]). Conclusion: At triage, violence risk assessment should consider the presence of antisocial behaviour and violent victimisation, substance use, male gender and frequency of inpatient admissions. Common treatment targets for the prevention of post-diagnostic violence include criminality and victimisation.

Design: Cross-correlation study. Location: 57 schools of secondary education, vocational education and university in five provinces of Spain (Huelva, Seville, A Coruña, Pontevedra and Asturias). Participants: 4,337 students aged between 15 and 26 years (40.6% males and 59.4% female) who had a dating relationship that lasted more than a month. Main measurements: The Gender Role Attitudes Scale was used, which consists of 20 indicators of egalitarian or sexism attitudes at the family, social and occupational level. The students also reported whether they suffered from recognized abuse (RA), unperceived abuse (UPA), or not abused (NA). Results: In the whole sample, 68.6% declared themselves NA, 26.4% were under a situation of UPA, and 5.0% were RA. The RA group was more frequent among the females (6.3%), ≥ 18 years (6.4%) and university students (6.9%). UPA was more common in males (30.2%). The most sexist attitudes were found in the occupational dimension and especially in men and adolescents (15-17 years). Less sexist attitudes were associated with a lower probability of experiencing UPA (odds ratio =.71; P-trend <.001). Conclusions: Sexism seems to hinder the recognition of abuse.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Euro-American feminism’s embeddedness in a neo-liberal geo-political framework has created new though contested spaces for knowledge production among scholars, practitioners and policy-makers. In particular, a theoretical tool that has lost its transformatory potential is disidentification, specifically as a signifier for forging collective activism within Europe. In the age of global mobility and border-crossings, Western feminist disidentification is increasingly framed through a pre-conceived notion of the ‘other’ as dis-empowered, exotic and violent. These faulty identifications rather than integrating multi-ethnic intersectional identities deepen the cleavages, especially within the academy. This article draws on two case studies that emerged following the Delhi gang rape case (2012) in New Delhi, India. These studies highlight how debates within the western academy are largely framed from the standpoint of the empowered European feminist self. Thus disidentification, rather than being a process for unpacking hegemonic discourses, becomes, instead, yet another way of packaging new hierarchies of knowledge.",2018-07-03,Journal,Article,"Gender, Place and Culture",23638,9,25,"Identifying to dis-identify: occidentalist feminism, the Delhi gang rape case and its internal others",1,true,10.1080/0966369X.2018.1435511,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,,2018.0,81.0,0.0,,987,1435437284,Suruchi Thapar-Björkert,145010301,M.

989,"© 2018, BJGP Open.Background: Same-sex attracted women (SSAW) have higher rates of alcohol and mental health problems than heterosexual women, but utilisation of and satisfaction with treatment is limited. Aim: This study investigated the influences on health service use for alcohol and mental health problems among SSAW. Design & setting: The Gelberg-Andersen behavioural model of health service utilisation was used to generate outcome variables. Method: A convenience sample of 521 community-connected Australian SSAW completed an online survey. Health service use according to sexual identity was compared using x2 analysis. Binary logistic regression examined associations between the independent variables with treatment utilisation. Results: Reports of alcohol treatment were very low. Only 41.1% of participants with service need had utilised mental health and alcohol treatment. Bisexual women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.76) and those with 'other' identities (AOR = 2.38) were more likely to use services than lesbian women. Enablers to service use were having a regular GP (AOR = 3.02); disclosure of sexuality to the GP (AOR = 2.42); lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community-connectedness (AOR = 1.11); and intimate partner violence ([IPV] AOR = 2.51). Social support was associated with a reduction in treatment use (AOR = 0.97). Significant access barriers included not feeling ready for help, and previous negative experiences related to sexual identity.

Journal of the International AIDS Society published by John Wiley & sons Ltd on behalf of the International AIDS Society.Introduction: Community mobilization (CM) is increasingly recognized as critical to generating changes in social norms and behaviours needed to achieve reductions in HIV. We conducted a CM intervention to modify negative gender norms, particularly among men, in order to reduce associated HIV risk. Methods: Twenty two villages in the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance Site in rural Mpumalanga, South Africa were randomized to either a theory-based, gender transformative, CM intervention or no intervention. Two cross-sectional, population-based surveys were conducted in 2012 (pre-intervention, n = 600 women; n = 581 men) and 2014 (post-intervention, n = 600 women; n = 575 men) among adults ages 18 to 35 years. We used an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach using survey regression cluster-adjusted standard errors to determine the intervention effect by trial arm on gender norms, measured using the Gender Equitable Mens Scale (GEMS), and secondary behavioural outcomes. Results: Among men, there was a significant 2.7 point increase (Beta Coefficient 95% CI: 0.62, 4.78, p = 0.01) in GEMS between those in intervention compared to control communities. We did not observe a significant difference in GEMS scores for women by trial arm. Among men and women in intervention communities, we did not observe significant differences in perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV), condom use at last sex or hazardous drinking compared to control communities. The number of sex partners in the past 12 months (AOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.77) were significantly lower in women in intervention communities compared to control communities and IPV victimization was lower among women in intervention communities, but the reduction was not statistically significant (AOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.16). Conclusion: Community mobilization can reduce negative gender norms among men and has the potential to create environments that are more supportive of preventing IPV and reducing HIV risk behaviour. Nevertheless, we did not observe that changes in attitudes towards gender norms resulted in desired changes in risk behaviours suggesting that more time may be necessary to change behaviour or that the intervention may need to address behaviours more directly.

This study aims to understanding the prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their risk factors amongst female sex worker (FSWs) in Soweto, South Africa. Methods A cross-sectional, respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey enrolled 508 FSWs. Raw and RDS adjusted data were analyzed using a chi-squared test of association and multinomial regression for risk factors associated with depression and PTSD. Findings Symptoms of severe depression were prevalent amongst 68.7%, PTSD was 39.6%, and 32.7% suffered from comorbid PTSD and depression. Experiencing 3 kinds of violence increased the likelihood of comorbidity (RRR4.11, 95% CI 1.52–11.12,p = 0.005). Internalised stigma increased the likelihood of one mental health condition (RRR1.25, 95% CI 1.10–1.42,p = 0.001), higher self-esteem was associated with independent (RRR1.14, 95% CI 1.05–1.25,p = 0.002) and comorbid conditions (RRR1.17, 95% CI 1.07–1.27,p = 0.001). Conclusion Our findings highlight the sizable burden of treatable mental health conditions among FSWs in Soweto.

We explore these questions in a sample of men and women employed in ""blue collar"" professions. Our results show that the relationships between observed male gender harassment and psychological and physical health symptoms, withdrawal and workplace deviance, and affective commitment, were indirect and mediated via witness anger.

993,"© 2016, The Author(s) 2016.Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health problem, and recent attention has focused on its impact on workers and workplaces. We provide findings from a pan-Canadian online survey on the relationships among IPV, work, and health. In total, 8,429 people completed the survey, 95.5% of them in English and 78.4% female. Reflecting the recruitment strategy, most (95.4%) were currently working, and unionized (81.4%). People with any lifetime IPV experience reported significantly poorer general health, mental health, and quality of life; those with both recent IPV and IPV experience over 12 months ago had the poorest health. Among those who had experienced IPV, about half reported that violence occurred at or near the workplace, and these people generally had poorer health outcomes. Employment status moderated the relationship between IPV exposure and health status, with those who were currently working and had experienced IPV having similar health status to those without IPV experience who were not employed. While there were gender differences in IPV experience, in the impacts of IPV at work, and in health status, gender did not moderate any associations. In this very large data set, we found robust relationships among different kinds of IPV exposure (current, recent, and lifetime), health and quality of life, and employment status, including the potentially protective effect of current employment on health for both women and men. Our findings may have implications for strategies to address IPV in workplaces, and should reinforce emerging evidence that IPV is also an occupational health issue.",2018-07-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,30,33,"Relationships Among Intimate Partner Violence, Work, and Health",0,false,10.1177/0886260515624236,SAGE Publications Inc.claims@sagepub.com,,,,,,993,,,,,,,,,,,,,112.0,6439.0,38.0,49.0,774.0,17.0,19.0,374.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,

995,"© 2018. The Authors.Background: Since 2013, approximately 4400 women have been murdered by their partners in South Africa. This is five times higher than the per capita global average. Domestic violence is known to be cyclical, endemic and frequently involves multiple victims. It also becomes progressively more dangerous over time and may lead to fatalities. In 2012, the Health Professions Council of South Africa released a domestic violence protocol for emergency service providers. This protocol, or screening guidelines, includes assessing future risk to domestic violence, providing physical and psychosocial care, documentation of evidence of abuse and informing patients of their rights and the services available to them. The extent to which these guidelines have been circulated and implemented, particularly by general health care practitioners (HCPs), is unknown. Aim: We review international treaties to which South Africa is a signatory, as well as national legislation and policies that reinforce the right to care for victims of domestic violence, to delineate the implication of these laws and policies for HCPs. Method: We reviewed literature and analysed national and international legislation and policies. Results: The 'norms' contained in existing guidelines and currently practiced in an ad hoc manner are not only compatible with existing statutory duties of HCPs but are in fact a natural extension of them. Conclusion: Proactive interventions such as the use of guidelines for working with victims of domestic violence enable suspected cases of domestic violence to be systematically identified, appropriately managed, properly referred, and should be adopted by all South African HCPs.",2018-06-18,Journal,Article,African Journal of Primary Health Care and Family Medicine,21100203104,2,10,"Legal duties, professional obligations or notional guidelines?

996,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: Substance use disorders are a major cause of health and social problems worldwide. Research evidence shows a strong graded relationship of adverse childhood experiences and substance use in adulthood. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences and their association with substance use among patients with substance use disorders. Method: The study used a descriptive cross-sectional design. A total of 134 patients aged 18 years and above receiving inpatient treatment for substance use disorders were recruited into the study. A mental state exam was done to rule out active psychopathology. Data on socio demographic variables, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and substance use was collected using Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire and The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test respectively. Data was analysed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 20 for windows. Results: Males accounted for the majority of the study participants (n = 118, 88.1%). Only 43.3% (n = 58) of the participants had a family history of substance use disorder. The most frequently used substance was alcohol which was reported by 82.1% of the participants. Nearly 93% of the respondents had experienced at least one ACE and the most prevalent ACE was one or no parent which was reported by half of the respondents. The adverse childhood experiences significantly associated with current problematic substance use were; emotional abuse, having someone with mental illness in the household, physical abuse and physical neglect. Emotional abuse significantly predicted tobacco (A.O.R = 5.3 (1.2-23.9)) and sedative (A.O.R = 4.1 (1.2-14.2)) use. Childhood exposure to physical abuse was associated with cannabis use [A.O.R = 2.9 (1.0-7.9)]. Experiencing five or more ACEs was associated with increased risk of using sedatives. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of adverse childhood experiences among patients with substance use disorders. Experiencing emotional abuse, having someone with mental illness in the household, physical abuse and physical neglect in childhood are risk factors of substance use disorders.

999,"© 2017 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.Service users’ self-perception of risk has rarely been emphasized in violence risk assessments. A recent review pointed to the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, because different perspectives may provide a deeper and improved understanding of risk assessment. The aim of this study was to investigate service users’ perceptions of their own risk of committing violence, using a self-report risk scale, to determine the feasibility and efficacy of this potential violence risk marker during acute mental health hospitalization. All service users admitted to a psychiatric emergency hospital in Norway during one calendar year were included (N = 512). Nearly 80% self-reported no risk or low risk; only seven (1.4%) reported moderate risk or high risk. Service users who reported moderate risk, high risk, don't know, or won't answer were more likely to be violent (OR = 4.65, 95% CI = 2.79–7.74) compared with those who reported no risk or low risk. There was a significant gender interaction with higher OR for women on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Although the OR was higher for women, women's violence rate (11.0%) was almost half that of men (21.8%). For women, sensitivity and specificity were 0.55 and 0.88, respectively; corresponding values for men were 0.40 and 0.80. Inclusion of self-perception of violence risk is the first step towards service users’ collaborative involvement in violence prediction; these results indicate that self-perception can contribute to violence risk assessments in acute mental health settings.

1000,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdSyndemic theory describes the clustering and synergistic interaction of disease driven by contextual and social factors, which worsen health outcomes for a population, and has been applied to men who have sex with men (MSM) and their risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Recent reviews, however, have critiqued prevailing approaches in syndemic studies that assess only additive associations without evaluation of synergy. Following these suggestions, we compared the traditional additive approach with a test for synergistic association of 5 syndemic conditions (alcohol dependence, illicit drug use, depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and childhood sexual abuse (CSA)) with unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) and active syphilis infection among 11,771 MSM recruited through respondent driven sampling from 12 cities in India. UAI was assessed via self-report and active syphilis infection was diagnosed by RPR and THPA tests. An additive association was explored using a condition count (range 0–5), and synergy was tested using relative excess risk due to interactions (RERIs) calculated from all 2-way and common 3-way interactions between conditions in adjusted regression models. There was a significant dose response associated with the syndemic count and UAI, and a similar pattern for syphilis, though not statistically significant. RERIs showed synergy for only one pair of conditions for UAI and syphilis, respectively: IPV + depression and alcohol dependence + illicit drug use. In this study, we found an additive association between syndemic conditions and UAI with evidence of synergistic interaction between a pair of psychosocial conditions, and no significant additive association, but a synergistic interaction between another pair of psychosocial conditions for syphilis. Our results lend further support to a critical reassessment of syndemic analyses.

Participants completed measures of EI (attention, clarity, and repair) at T1 and DVP at T1 and T2. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses showed that the strongest predictor of DVP was previous level of aggression. EI moderated the maintenance of DVP over time. Specifically, those adolescents with a higher competence of clarity showed a lower perpetuation of DVP. The other two components of EI (attention and repair) displayed a gender-specific effect. In particular, a lower perpetuation of DVP was found for girls with higher scores on emotional attention, and for boys with higher scores on emotional repair.

Methods: Undergraduate students (ages 18–24) from six francophone universities in Quebec, Canada (N = 4,264) completed online questionnaires regarding their experience of sexual violence, as well as the context of these acts (e.g., the gender of the perpetrator, the status of the perpetrator, and the location of the violence). They also provided information regarding their sexual and gender minority status. Binary logistic regressions were conducted to assess for variation in experiencing sexual violence across sexual and gender minority status. Results: Transgender/nonbinary students generally reported higher levels of sexual violence than their cisgender peers, while variation occurred with regard to vulnerability across sexual identity subgroups. Few differences in context were observed across sexual minority identity. Transgender/nonbinary students were significantly more likely to report sexual violence in athletic contexts and during volunteering activities compared to their cisgender peers.

1004,"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand the constructions of female-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) among postgraduate (PG) students studying and preparing for a career in forensic psychology. A social constructionist methodological framework was adopted in order to explore students’ dominant discourses surrounding gender and IPV. Of particular interest was how female perpetrators of IPV within heterosexual relationships were constructed and subsequently positioned by students in terms of social and gender identity. Implications regarding future practice for graduates in relation to risk assessment and treatment interventions are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: Six female PG forensic students took part in a qualitative focus group and discussed their understanding of IPV and views regarding perpetration. Focus group members were also asked to discuss details of a vignette depicting a violent relationship where gender identity was purposefully removed. The focus group interview data were analysed using Foucauldian discourse analysis. Findings: The students constructed IPV as a behaviour that was predominantly perpetrated by men towards women. Students acknowledged that female-perpetrated IPV occurred; however, such behaviour was constructed as non-threatening, and subsequently, less serious than male-perpetrated IPV. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the overall discourses drawn on by the students projected a feminine representation of female IPV that positioned women as emotionally unstable, vulnerable and acting in self-defence. Research limitations/implications: Students’ constructions of female-perpetrated IPV appeared to minimise aggression. It is argued that the positioning of women in terms of vulnerability serves to undermine any responsibility for perpetrating violence among this group of students. In terms of implications for practice, oversimplified assumptions in relation to gendered constructions have the potential to inhibit female IPV from being recognised as a serious form of aggression, and it is argued that this could potentially bias assessments of risk leading to an under-estimation of threat. Female perpetrators of IPV may subsequently receive inadequate supervision and intervention and inadequate levels of victim safety planning may occur. These gendered constructions may also inhibit male victims from seeking help and help being offered. Originality/value: This paper highlights the importance of understanding constructions of IPV among students who are preparing for careers as a forensic psychology practitioner. Female IPV is clearly challenging. With respect to the social construction of IPV, the students in this study made many assumptions about female identity by linking this to feminine and essentialist ideas that constrain women as emotionally and biologically vulnerable. Such findings raise questions about whether future training and study programmes are equipped to critically challenge the dominant discourses and subsequent constructions of gender and IPV. Thus, this study has highlighted the need for further research around constructions of IPV in this field of work in order to fully examine potential knowledge gaps in training and teaching of future forensic practitioners.",2018-05-15,Journal,Article,"Journal of Aggression, Conflict and Peace Research",20600195510,4,10,Gender representations of female perpetrators of intimate partner violence,2,,10.1108/JACPR-02-2017-0273,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"Journal of Aggression, Conflict and Peace Research",2017.0,110.0,1.0,,1004,2110582320,Jenna Walker,78139537,J.

1005,"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The interpersonal theory of suicide proposes that fearlessness about death, one aspect of the capability for suicide, may explain men’s greater risk for death by suicide. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether violence perpetration and victimization would mediate the relation of gender with fearlessness about death in suicidal psychiatric inpatients. Design/methodology/approach: The current study used a cross-sectional survey design in a sample of 196 psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide risk. Findings: Men endorsed greater fearlessness about death compared to women. The relation of gender with fearlessness about death was partially mediated by violence perpetration, but not victimization. Violence perpetration may play a more central role in the development of fearlessness about death, the capability for suicide, and the transition from suicide ideation to action compared to violence victimization. Research limitations/implications: The current study was cross-sectional and not able to definitively answer questions about the development of the capability for suicide. Future research must examine how fearlessness about death evolves over time. Practical implications: Suicide risk assessment should include history of violence perpetration, as this may better identify those who may be at greater risk for suicide due to greater fearlessness about death.

1006,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: Many emergency primary health care workers experience aggressive behaviour from patients or visitors. Simple incident-reporting procedures exist for inpatient, psychiatric care, but a similar and simple incident-report for other health care settings is lacking. The aim was to adjust a pre-existing form for reporting aggressive incidents in a psychiatric inpatient setting to the emergency primary health care settings. We also wanted to assess the validity of the severity scores in emergency primary health care. Methods: The Staff Observation Scale - Revised (SOAS-R) was adjusted to create a pilot version of the Staff Observation Scale - Revised Emergency (SOAS-RE). A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was added to the form to judge the severity of the incident. Data for validation of the pilot version of SOAS-RE were collected from ten casualty clinics in Norway during 12 months. Variance analysis was used to test gender and age differences. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relative impact that each of the five SOAS-RE columns had on the VAS score. The association between SOAS-RE severity score and VAS severity score was calculated by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: The SOAS-R was adjusted to emergency primary health care, refined and called The Staff Observation Aggression Scale - Revised Emergency (SOAS-RE). A total of 350 SOAS-RE forms were collected from the casualty clinics, but due to missing data, 291 forms were included in the analysis. SOAS-RE scores ranged from 1 to 22. The mean total severity score of SOAS-RE was 10.0 (standard deviation (SD) =4.1) and the mean VAS score was 45.4 (SD = 26.7). We found a significant correlation of 0.45 between the SOAS-RE total severity scores and the VAS severity ratings. The linear regression analysis showed that individually each of the categories, which described the incident, had a low impact on the VAS score. Conclusions: The SOAS-RE seems to be a useful instrument for research, incident-recording and management of incidents in emergency primary care. The moderate correlation between SOAS-RE severity score and the VAS severity score shows that application of both the severity ratings is valuable to follow-up of workers affected by workplace violence.",2018-05-08,Journal,Article,BMC Health Services Research,28098,5,18,The Staff Observation Aggression Scale - Revised (SOAS-R) - Adjustment and validation for emergency primary health care,1,true,10.1186/s12913-018-3157-z,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Health Services Research,2018.0,54.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The moderate correlation between SOAS-RE severity score and the VAS severity score shows that application of both the severity ratings is valuable to follow-up of workers affected by workplace violence.'}",1006,36796175,T.

1009,"© Copyright 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns of childhood adversity in a sample of adolescents and assess disparities in these experiences for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning adolescents and by level of gender nonconformity. METHOD By using the cross-sectional, statewide, anonymous 2016 Minnesota Student Survey, 81 885 students were included in the current study (50.59% male; mean age = 15.51). Participants were enrolled in grades 9 and 11 in a total of 348 schools. RESULTS: Four patterns of childhood adversity were identified with sex-stratified latent class analyses (entropy = 0.833 males; 0.833 females), ranging from relatively low levels of abuse (85.3% males; 80.1% females) to polyvictimization (0.84% males; 1.98% females). A regression analysis showed that compared with heterosexual adolescents, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning adolescents were more likely to be classified into profiles characterized by polyvictimization (odds ratio [OR] 1.81-7.53) and psychological and/or physical abuse (OR 1.29-3.12), than no or low adversity. Similarly, compared with nontransgender adolescents, transgender adolescents were more likely to be classified into profiles characterized by patterns of polyvictimization (OR 1.49-2.91) and psychological and/or physical abuse (OR 1.23-1.96). A higher level of gender nonconformity predicted a higher likelihood of being classified into each adversity profile compared with the no or low adversity profile (OR 1.14-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minority adolescents and adolescents with high levels of gender nonconformity are vulnerable to experience adversity. The disparities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning adolescents and adolescents with high gender nonconformity highlight the variation in patterns of childhood adversity that these youth are at risk of experiencing.

1010,"© 2017, Society for Prevention Research.Male perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in sub-Saharan Africa is widespread. Theory and empirical evidence suggest peer networks may play an important role in shaping IPV perpetration, though research on this topic in the region is limited. We assessed the degree to which peer network gender norms are associated with Tanzanian men’s perpetration of IPV and examined whether the social cohesion of peer networks moderates this relationship. Using baseline data from sexually active men (n = 1103) nested within 59 peer networks enrolled in an on-going cluster-randomized HIV and IPV prevention trial, we fit multilevel logistic regression models to examine peer network-level factors associated with past-year physical IPV perpetration. Peer network gender norms were significantly associated with men’s risk of perpetrating IPV, even after adjusting for their own attitudes toward gender roles (OR = 1.53 , p = . 04). Peer network social cohesion moderated this relationship (OR = 1.50 , p = . 04); the positive relationship between increasingly inequitable (i.e., traditional) peer network gender norms and men’s risk of perpetrating IPV became stronger, as peer network social cohesion increased. Characteristics of the peer network context are associated with men’s IPV perpetration and should be targeted in future interventions.

In Study 2, 123 participants completed a questionnaire which was based on the results of Study 1. They were asked to evaluate the severity and justification for this same IPV case in relation to several situations identified in interviews. They also completed two scales measuring adherence to ideologies legitimizing male dominance: the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and the Domestic Violence Myth Acceptance Scale. Results show expressed ambivalence by participants between condemnation of IPV and the use of conditional logics in order to minimize or justify it.

1012,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: In Cambodia, HIV prevalence is concentrated in key populations including among female entertainment workers (FEWs) who may engage in direct or indirect sex work. Reaching FEWs with sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services has been difficult because of their hidden and stigmatized nature. Mobile-phone-based interventions may be an effective way to reach this population and connect them with the existing services. This article describes study design and implementation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a mobile health intervention (the Mobile Link) aiming to improve SRH and related outcomes among FEWs in Cambodia. Methods: A two-arm RCT will be used to determine the effectiveness of a mobile-phone-based text/voice messaging intervention. The intervention will be developed through a participatory process. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews have been conducted to inform and tailor behavior change theory-based text and voice messages. During the implementation phase, 600 FEWs will be recruited and randomly assigned into one of the two arms: (1) a control group and (2) a mobile phone message group (either text messages [SMS] or voice messages [VM], a delivery method chosen by participants). Participants in the control group will also receive a weekly monitoring survey, which will provide real-time information to implementing partners to streamline outreach efforts and be able to quickly identify geographic trends. The primary outcome measures will include self-reported HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing and treatment, condom use, contraceptive use, and gender-based violence (GBV). Discussion: If the Mobile Link trial is successful, participants will report an increase in condom use, linkages to screening and treatment for HIV and STI, and contraception use as well as a reduction in GBV. This trial is unique in a number of ways. First, the option of participation mode (SMS or VM) allows participants to choose the message medium that best links them to services.

Our analyses reveal how the shooter constructs and ‘does’ masculinity in adherence to masculine cultural ideals. Rodger reproduces hegemonic gender ideologies through his construction of masculinity in relation to physical embodiment and sexual prowess. Those who displayed these traits are constructed as superior men, characterizing men who lacked them as inferior. Interestingly, Rodger presents himself as lacking in these areas. As such, he draws on alternative masculine presentations to illustrate his manhood. When he does not receive societal confirmation of his masculinity, he experiences a crisis of masculinity and feelings of aggrieved entitlement wherein he directs his anger at racial minorities and women.

Little is known about the relationship between gender-based discrimination (GBD) and URAI with stable partners among transgender women. Methods This mixed-methods research began with a cross-sectional survey conducted between 2014 and 2016 with transgender women in Salvador, the capital city in one of the poorest regions in Brazil. Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit the study population. GBD was defined through Latent Class Analysis. Additionally, 19 semi-structured interviews with participants were transcribed and analyzed through thematic content analysis. Results URAI with stable partners was commonly reported (37.3%). GDB was positively associated with URAI among stable partners (OR = 6.47; IC 95%: 1.67–25.02). The analysis of the interviews illustrated how GBD impacted transgender women in diverse ways. Experiences with GBD perpetrated by the family often initiated a trajectory of economic vulnerability that led many to engage in survival sex work. The constant experience with GBD contributed to participants feeling an immense sense of trust with their stable partners, ultimately diminished their desire to use condoms. Further, the high frequency of GBD contributed to poor mental health overall, though some participants said engagement in transgender advocacy efforts provided a vital source of resilience and support.",2018-04-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,17,13,Gender-based discrimination and unprotected receptive anal intercourse among transgender women in Brazil: A mixed methods study,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0194306,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,PLoS ONE,2018.0,82.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'By confirming the association between greater GBD and URAI, this mixed-method study demonstrates how GBD can impact condom negotiation in diverse relationships and capitalizes upon the strengths of diverse data sets to produce a holistic understanding.'}",1016,40640245,Laio Magno,6179109,I.

1017,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: Over the years, researchers have relied on data from women victims to understand the profile on male perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV studies with male participants in the general population are still emerging in Africa. The contribution of mental ill health to IPV perpetration in the general population that has been documented elsewhere is emergent. Notwithstanding, research with male perpetrators is essential to informing effective prevention programmes and interventions. To contribute to the emerging literature on male perpetrators, we conducted a study to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with IPV perpetration by men in heterosexual relationships. We also modelled pathways to IPV perpetration using data from Zimbabwe. Methods: Data were collected through a nationwide survey employing a random and multi-staged sampling method. We recruited and administered a structured questionnaire to 2838 men aged 18 years and above. IPV was measured using an adapted WHO Domestic Violence Questionnaire. Determinants of IPV measured included child abuse, alcohol abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive symptoms, personal gender attitudes and risky sexual behaviours. Multivariate regression modelling was used to assess factors associated with IPV perpetration. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the underlying pathways to recent IPV perpetration. Results: Forty one percent of men had perpetrated IPV in their lifetime and 8.8% percent of men perpetrated IPV in the 12 months before the survey. Older, more educated men, men who binge drank, men who were abused as children or experienced other life traumatic experiences were more likely to perpetrate IPV in lifetime. Depressive symptoms and sexual relationship power (were also associated with lifetime IPV perpetration. IPV perpetration in the last 12 months was associated with binge drinking, PTSD and sexual relationship power. The pathways to IPV perpetration in the last 12 months from child abuse to recent IPV were mediated by comorbid PTSD symptoms, depression binge drinking and sexual relationship power. Conclusions: IPV perpetration was associated with child abuse history, mental ill health, sexual relationship power and personal gender attitudes.

Methods and analysis A C-RCT of nine intervention and nine control clusters is being carried out in a periurban, semiformal settlement near Johannesburg, South Africa, between 2016 and 2018. A community mobilisation and advocacy intervention, called Sonke CHANGE is being implemented over 18 months. It comprises local advocacy and group activities to engage community members to challenge harmful gender norms and reduce VAW. The intervention is hypothesised to improve equitable masculinities, reduce alcohol use and ultimately, to reduce VAW. Intervention effectiveness will be determined through an audio computer-assisted self-interview questionnaire with behavioural measures among 2600 men aged between 18 and 40 years at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. The primary trial outcome is men's use of physical and/or sexual VAW. Secondary outcomes include harmful alcohol use, gender attitudes, controlling behaviours, transactional sex and social cohesion. The main analysis will be intention-to-treat based on the randomisation of clusters. A qualitative process evaluation is being conducted alongside the C-RCT. Implementers and men participating in the intervention will be interviewed longitudinally over the period of intervention implementation and observations of the workshops and other intervention activities are being carried out. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee and procedures comply with ethical recommendations of the United Nations Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence. Dissemination of research findings will take place with local stakeholders and through peer-reviewed publications, with data available on request or after 5 years of trial completion.

1019,"© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.Background A huge amount of literature suggests that adolescents' health-related behaviors tend to occur in clusters, and the understanding of such behavioral clustering may have direct implications for the effective tailoring of health-promotion interventions. Despite the usefulness of analyzing clustering, Italian data on this topic are scant. This study aimed to evaluate the clustering patterns of health-related behaviors. Methods The present study is based on data from the Health Behaviors in School-aged Children (HBSC) study conducted in Tuscany in 2010, which involved 3291 11-, 13- and 15-year olds. To aggregate students' data on 22 health-related behaviors, factor analysis and subsequent cluster analysis were performed. Results Factor analysis revealed eight factors, which were dubbed in accordance with their main traits: 'Alcohol drinking', 'Smoking', 'Physical activity', 'Screen time', 'Signs & symptoms', 'Healthy eating', 'Violence' and 'Sweet tooth'. These factors explained 67% of variance and underwent cluster analysis. A six-cluster -means solution was established with a 93.8% level of classification validity. The between-cluster differences in both mean age and gender distribution were highly statistically significant. Conclusions Health-compromising behaviors are common among Tuscan teens and occur in distinct clusters. These results may be used by schools, health-promotion authorities and other stakeholders to design and implement tailored preventive interventions in Tuscany.",2018-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Public Health (United Kingdom),12252,13,40,Clustering of health-related behaviors among early and mid-adolescents in Tuscany: Results from a representative cross-sectional study,1,true,10.1093/pubmed/fdw134,Oxford University Press,Journal of public health,2016.0,48.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Health-compromising behaviors are common among Tuscan teens and occur in distinct clusters, and these results may be used by schools, health-promotion authorities and other stakeholders to design and implement tailored preventive interventions in Tuscany.'}",1019,34261724,G.

1020,"© 2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdAims and objectives: This study sought to describe how women in Mexico who have suffered from gender-based violence experience their encounters with healthcare professionals. Background: Gender-based violence is a worldwide problem. Previous studies have described that women feel they are not being cared for appropriately during their encounters with healthcare professionals. This study was conducted in Mexico, which has a high rate of gender inequality. Design: A descriptive, qualitative study was conducted. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with seven women. An inductive content analysis was used to analyse the interviews. Results: The analyses resulted in four categories: Feelings of guilt about being abused, Feelings of being unimportant, Feelings of taking time and Feelings of being insecure/secure. The women emphasised the importance of healthcare professionals taking time out of their busy schedules for them. When they treated the women with respect and genuine interest, the women felt secure. When the healthcare professionals did not meet these expectations, feelings of frustration and mistrust were elicited. Conclusions: Feelings of being listened to and safety were considered important aspects in a positive encounter, whereas feeling a lack of time or interest often led to negative experiences such as frustration with and distrust of the healthcare system. These results imply that healthcare professionals may have deficiencies with regard to how these women are treated because these women do not feel that they receive the proper support. Relevance to clinical practice: Education regarding how to approach women who have suffered from gender-based violence is essential for healthcare professionals to establish respectful encounters. The findings of this study stress that relatively simple efforts such as listening to these women's stories and providing them with genuine attention might substantially improve care.",2018-03-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Clinical Nursing,28191,9,27,Women's experiences with healthcare professionals after suffering from gender-based violence: An interview study,2,,10.1111/jocn.14046,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Journal of Clinical Nursing,2018.0,52.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Feelings of being listened to and safety were considered important aspects in a positive encounter, whereas feeling a lack of time or interest often led to negative experiences such as frustration with and distrust of the healthcare system.'}",1020,5717335,Inger Wallin Lundell,23308664,Louise Eulau,1399513182,Frida Bjarneby,6408287,Margareta Westerbotn,,,,,6.0,90.0,5.0,6.0,18.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,1.0,28.0,289.0,12.0,,,,,,,Medicine
1021,"© 2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdAim and objectives: To examine associations between risk of aggression and nursing interventions designed to prevent aggression. Background: There is scarce empirical research exploring the nature and effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent inpatient aggression. Some strategies may be effective when patients are escalating, whereas others may be effective when aggression is imminent. Research examining level of risk for aggression and selection and effectiveness of interventions and impact on aggression is necessary. Design: Archival case file. Methods: Data from clinical files of 30 male and 30 female patients across three forensic acute units for the first 60 days of hospitalisation were collected. Risk for imminent aggression as measured by the Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression, documented nursing interventions following each assessment, and acts of aggression within the 24-hours following assessment were collected. Generalised estimating equations were used to investigate whether intervention strategies were associated with reduction in aggression. Results: When a Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression assessment was completed, nurses intervened more frequently compared to days when no Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression assessment was completed. Higher Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression assessments were associated with a greater number of interventions. The percentage of interventions selected for males differed from females; males received more pro re nata medication and observation, and females received more limit setting, one-to-one nursing and reassurance. Pro re nata medication was the most commonly documented intervention (35.9%) in this study. Pro re nata medication, limit setting and reassurance were associated with an increased likelihood of aggression in some risk bands. Conclusions: Structured risk assessment prompts intervention, and higher risk ratings result in more interventions. Patient gender influences the type of interventions. Some interventions are associated with increased aggression, although this depends upon gender and risk level. Relevance to clinical practice: When structured risk assessments are used, there is greater likelihood of intervention.

1023,"© 2017Introduction: Investigations of patterns of sexual arousal to certain groups of sexually explicit media (SEM) in the general population in non-laboratory settings are rare. Such knowledge could be important to understand more about the relative specificity of sexual arousal in different SEM users. Aims: (i) To investigate whether sexual arousal to non-mainstream vs mainstream SEM contents could be categorized across gender and sexual orientation, (ii) to compare levels of SEM-induced sexual arousal, sexual satisfaction, and self-evaluated sexual interests and fantasies between non-mainstream and mainstream SEM groups, and (iii) to explore the validity and predictive accuracy of the Non-Mainstream Pornography Arousal Scale (NPAS). Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of 2,035 regular SEM users in Croatia. Main Outcomes Measures: Patterns of sexual arousal to 27 different SEM themes, sexual satisfaction, and self-evaluations of sexual interests and sexual fantasies. Results: Groups characterized by sexual arousal to non-mainstream SEM could be identified across gender and sexual orientation. These non-mainstream SEM groups reported more SEM use and higher average levels of sexual arousal across the 27 SEM themes assessed compared with mainstream SEM groups. Only few differences were found between non-mainstream and mainstream SEM groups in self-evaluative judgements of sexual interests, sexual fantasies, and sexual satisfaction. The internal validity and predictive accuracy of the NPAS was good across most user groups investigated. Conclusions: The findings suggest that in classified non-mainstream SEM groups, patterns of sexual arousal might be less fixated and category specific than previously assumed. Further, these groups are not more judgmental of their SEM-related sexual arousal patterns than groups characterized by patterns of sexual arousal to more mainstream SEM content. Moreover, accurate identification of non-mainstream SEM group membership is generally possible across gender and sexual orientation using the NPAS. Hald GM, Stulhofer A, Lange T, et al.

1025,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco. All rights reserved.Introduction: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer/questioning (LGBQ) microaggressions refer to oftenunintentional insults, assaults, and invalidations that denigrate sexual minorities. While experiencing hostile discrimination and violence has previously been associated with elevated rates of smoking cigarettes for LGBQ college students, the relationship between LGBQ microaggressions and smoking is unknown. Methods: Data from a national anonymous online survey of sexual and gender minority college students were used to examine the relationship between past month cigarette smoking and interpersonal LGBQ microaggressions. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the relationship between smoking and frequent (chronic) experiences of microaggressions, using a hierarchical procedure to control for demographics, predictors of smoking, and academic factors. Results: Past year frequent LGBQ microaggression was reported by 48% of respondents and was more common among students who smoked in past 30 days. Experiencing past year physical violence was reported by 15% and did not differ by smoking status. Past year frequent experience of microaggressions was associated with increased odds of 1.72 (95% CI 1.03-2.87) for past 30-day smoking after adjusting for age, gender, race, socioeconomic indicators, alcohol misuse, physical violence, as well as academic stress and engagement. Conclusions: The results indicate that frequently experiencing LGBQ microaggressions is a risk factor for LGBQ college students smoking cigarettes. The mechanisms underlying this relationship require additional research, as does identifying positive coping strategies and institutional strategies to address LGBQ microaggressions on campuses. Tobacco control efforts should consider the impact of microaggression on the social environment for the prevention and treatment of tobacco use among LGBQ individuals. Implications: Microaggressions related to sexual minority identity include subtle forms of discrimination experienced during daily interactions that can create hostile and stressful social environments for a socially disadvantaged group. Prior research has demonstrated that LGBQ college students have higher rates of cigarette smoking, and that experiencing identity-based violence is a risk factor. This study revealed that experiencing frequent LGBQ microaggressions on college campus is associated with increased likelihood of current smoking among LGBQ college students.",2018-02-07,Journal,Article,Nicotine and Tobacco Research,17058,20,20,Frequent experience of LGBQ microaggression on campus associated with smoking among sexual minority college students,0,false,10.1093/ntr/ntw305,Oxford University Press,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2016.0,53.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is revealed that experiencing frequent LGBQ microaggressions on college campus is associated with increased likelihood of current smoking among L GBQ college students.'}",1025,5717844,Thomas E Ylioja,38091515,Gerald T.

1029,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdChildren in foster care frequently have histories of physical/sexual abuse and neglect, increasing their risk for externalizing behaviors (EB; e.g., aggression). According to the differential susceptibility theory, children with reactive temperaments (e.g., negative emotionality) may be particularly vulnerable to early maltreatment, but may also benefit the most from environmental enrichment such as family cohesion. In a high-risk longitudinal sample of 82 children adopted from foster care in Los Angeles County from 1996 and 2001, we examined predictions of EB from childhood to adolescence/young adulthood from temperament, preadoption maltreatment, and adoptive family cohesion. Overall, results from generalized linear models and generalized estimating equations (GEE) did not support differential susceptibility theory – specifically, youth with early reactive temperament did not exhibit heightened sensitivity to maltreatment nor to later adoptive family cohesion. Instead, reactive temperament was associated with higher EB at initial adoptive placement and escalating EB across childhood, controlling for age, gender, race-ethnicity, preadoption maltreatment, and adoptive family cohesion. Preadoption maltreatment history was unrelated to baseline EB, although sexual abuse history predicted escalating childhood EB post-adoption, whereas exposure to family violence (e.g., domestic violence) inversely predicted EB over time. By late adolescence/young adulthood 11–15 years post-adoption, rates of arrest and substance use in this sample were relatively comparable to normative populations of youth, although older age of adoption predicted more substance use in late adolescence/young adulthood.

1031,"© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.With the growing adoption of Internet and mobile technology, the information exchange via social media has greatly influenced both government and corporate operations. Social Media has not only become a platform for mere entertainment and communication but a great source of innovation for public services. While millions of users generate data on these social media platforms everyday, the challenge is to effectively extract and analyze information from the big social data in a productive manner for improving public services of future smart and connected communities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of creating an Intervention Support System (ISS) interface for public services of a city to easily and effiectively monitor attitude trends of public for topics of interest (e.g., a cleanliness awareness campaign), while hiding all the complex functionality of collecting, processing, and mining big user-generated data from social media. We first discuss the generic architecture of ISS and its various components, followed by demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed architecture via an application design to identify intervention targets on social networks for supporting public campaigns against the key societal crisis of gender-based violence.

The mandatory reporting of gender violence has become a controversial issue among health care practitioners and victims. The objective of this study was to analyze the quality of the way in which injury reports on victims of gender violence is completed, through an analysis of the information they include, the readability and the degree to which the document can be understood. A retrospective study in a sample of 197 injury reports were performed from health services (primary care, hospital services and emergency services). We analyzed 22 variables related to the content, readability of the document, the victim’s identification data as well as identification of the doctor responsible for assistance, the moment of assistance and the characteristics of the injury. The most frequent deficiencies in the data are identification of the doctor responsible for medical attention, the date on which the aggression occurred, a description of the injuries and the judgment of compatibility between the cause of injury (according to the victim) and the actual injury they have.

Tous droits réservés pour tous pays.This article looks at the criticisms levelled against a statistical study of gender violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) individuals. During the questionnaire and data collection, respondents considered the recording of gender and sexuality to be problematic, particularly when they refused to define themselves as male or female, bisexual or homosexual, describing themselves instead as “non-binary”. Although they represent a minority, these criticisms are interesting in that they challenge the framework of this study into violence, and in fact denounce it as being violent in itself. The article distinguishes between two registers of criticism, one that seeks the recognition of minority identifications and the other that questions categorisation in itself. The critical respondents are younger than the others, often women, most often identifying as bisexual, and sometimes in situations of downward mobility. Criticism can be seen as the expression of an indetermination that is both a lived experience and a political claim, often proclaimed by individuals who are all the more likely to refuse dominant assignations of gender and sexuality as the latter are less relevant and less salient for them.",2018-01-01,Journal,Article,Revue Francaise de Sociologie,17363,11,59,"LGBT and non-binary people in boxes Statistical categorisation and criticism of gender and sexuality assignation in a study on violence Des LGBT, des non-binaires et des cases Catégorisation statistique et critique des assignations de genre et de sexualité dans une enquête sur les violences",0,false,10.3917/rfs.594.0677,Editions Ophryseditions.ophrys@ophrys.fr,,2018.0,15.0,1.0,,1034,51292044,Mathieu Trachman,65872154,Tania Lejbowicz,,,,,,,,,36.0,82.0,5.0,5.0,44.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology

The purpose of this study is to examine cultural violence against women in three films directed by a prominent Thai film director, Bhandevanov Devakula: The Eternity, The Outrage, and Jan Dara. A series of in-depth interviews with informants who are the stakeholders at the civil society level was conducted in Thailand. The informants were three policymakers, five academics, three non-governmental organisation (NGO) leaders, two film critics, two film directors, and a newspaper editor in Thailand. The data were analysed thematically using NVivo 10 software. The results of this study indicated that the informants identified cultural violence in the form of marriage bondage, power acceptance, cynical attitude, keeping women in customary roles, self-control, and gender bias. The cultural violence was depicted in the form of direct violence. This study also found that the stakeholders from diverse backgrounds noticed and framed the meaning of cultural violence in different ways. The significance of this study is in providing a deep understanding of the circumstances associated with cultural violence against women in Thai films that reflect the Thai context from the perspectives of stakeholders from multiple sectors.

All rights reserved.Background: Research on the syndemic health threats facing sexual minority men suggests that the elevated risk of HIV among this population co-occurs with other psychosocial health disparities. This study aimed to conduct a population-based examination of clinically assessed syndemic predictors of HIV infection among gay and bisexual, compared with heterosexual, men. Setting and Methods: The sample comprised adult men in the Stockholm Public Health Cohort. A total of 29,328 (91.9%) selfidentified as heterosexual, 535 (1.7%) as gay, and 396 (1.2%) as bisexual. We linked survey responses to national health registry data. Results: Gay men had vastly elevated risk of HIV infection (>150 times) compared with heterosexuals. Gay men also had an elevated risk of depression, suicidality, and violent assaults compared with heterosexuals. Bisexual men had 16 times higher risk of being HIVpositive than heterosexual men. The number of psychosocial syndemic conditions was significantly associated with HIV infection among gay men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.18 to 2.36), but not among bisexual and heterosexual men (AOR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.07 to 3.59; AOR = 1.92; 95% CI: 0.96 to 3.84). Among gay men, the association between cooccurring syndemic conditions and odds of HIV infection was synergistic (ie, more than additive).

From 2014 to 2017, POWER recruited BTW who attended Black Pride events in 6 U.S. cities. Participants completed a behavioral health survey and were offered onsite HIV testing. Simple frequencies were used to characterize the HIV care continuum, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify correlates of HIV diagnosis and viral suppression.Results:A total of 422 BTW provided completed data for our analysis, 45.0% of whom were living with HIV. Over half of the HIV-positive BTW (51.4%) reported being undiagnosed at the time of survey, and 24.5% reported viral suppression. Incarceration and a lack of access to medical care were significantly and positively associated with an undiagnosed HIV-positive status in multivariable models. Incarceration, homelessness, polydrug use, physical assault, intimate partner violence, and current hormone use were significantly and negatively associated with viral suppression in multivariable models.Conclusions:Developing and implementing interventions that address timely HIV diagnosis may assist in informing the HIV disparity among BTW in the United States.

Design Cross-sectional analyses were conducted on baseline data gathered between October 2015 and April 2016 from FSWs participating in Project Shikamana, a community empowerment-based combination HIV prevention intervention. Setting Participants were recruited for the baseline study using venue-based time-location sampling in two communities in Iringa, Tanzania. Participants FSWs were eligible for participation if they were 18 years or older and had exchanged sex for money within the past month. Four-hundred ninety-six FSWs participated in the baseline survey. Primary and secondary outcome measures Any recent experience of GBV was examined by recent work-related mobility among FSWs. Any recent experience of GBV was also disaggregated by severity for analyses. All bivariate and multivariate binary and multinomial logistic regressions adjusted for intraclass correlations among women recruited from the same venues. Results Forty per cent of participants experienced recent physical or sexual violence, and 30% recently experienced severe physical or sexual violence. Thirtythree per cent of participants recently exchanged sex for money outside of their district or region, and 12% were both intraregionally and inter-regionally mobile for sex work. Intraregionally and inter-regionally mobile FSWs had 1.9 times greater odds of reporting recent GBV (adjusted OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.06 to 3.38; p=0.031) compared with non-mobile FSWs and a 2.5 times higher relative risk for recent experience of severe GBV relative to no recent GBV (relative risk ratio: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.33 to 4.74; p=0.005).

Gender violence is characterized as a phenomenon of multiple determinations that defines any act based on gender relations that results in physical and psychological harm or suffering. It refers to the hierarchy of power, desires of domination and annihilation of the other, and that can be used consciously sometimes in relationships as a mechanism for subordination of one person to the partner. Understanding how violence occurs from gender relations is essential in order for the phenomenon to be addressed.

1047,"Background: Increasing antisocial and violent behaviors in adolescents and young adults present serious challenges for public health. Children with persistent high levels of aggressiveness are often associated with developing conduct disorders later in life. Early detection of highly aggressive children and sociodemographic risk-modifying factors are important for developing effective preventive strategies. Objectives: The present study was undertaken to assess levels of aggressiveness for detecting highly aggressive children in sample populations of primary school children in an urban setting and determine significant biosociocultural risk-modifying factors in this scenario. Methods: The study was conducted during August-September, 2015 in 5 primary schools of South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Sociodemographic data on 2080 students were collected. Overall aggressiveness scores (OA-Scores) were estimated using a self-report questionnaire in Hindi. Results: Categorizing students according to their OA-Scores, the data revealed that highly aggressive children constituted 4.3% of the study population. Analysis showed significant influence of (a) gender: boys displayed higher levels of aggressiveness compared to girls; (b) dietary pattern: omnivores showed higher aggressiveness than vegetarians; and (c) school environment: boys in mixed-sex (coeducational) schools displayed lower aggressiveness than from single-sex schools.

It's a public health problem in which nurses can perform a important role of secondary prevention. Methodology: In order to learn about the phenomenon of the gender violence and the procedures for detection and early intervention from primary care nursing, we conducer a literature review through primary and secondary sources. Results: Secondary prevention of gender-based violence is an essential task from the primary care teams. Indicators of suspicion in the literature are diverse, and its detection depends on the possibility of intervention. The identification of cases is based on the relationship of trust and in techniques such as the use of questionnaires of interview. Before his confirmation procedures are regulated by different legal and deontological rules. Conclusions: Gender-based violence is a serious problem which affects, significantly, to the health of women suffers it. Primary care nursing plays an essential role, since it possesses great accessibility and direct contact with the women throughout the life cycle, being able to detect early gender-based violence.

1049,"© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.The social gradient for cardiovascular disease (CVD) onset and outcomes is well established. The American Heart Association's Social Determinants of Risk and Outcomes of Cardiovascular Disease Scientific Statement advocates looking beyond breakthroughs in biological science toward a social determinants approach that focuses on socioeconomic position, race and ethnicity, social support, culture and access to medical care, and residential environments to curb the burden of CVD going forward. Indeed, the benefits of this approach are likely to be far reaching, enhancing the positive effects of advances in CVD related to prevention and treatment while reducing health inequities that contribute to CVD onset and outcomes. It is disappointing that the role of gender has been largely neglected despite being a critical determinant of cardiovascular health. It is clear that trajectories and outcomes of CVD differ by biological sex, yet the tendency for sex and gender to be conflated has contributed to the idea that both are constant or fixed with little room for intervention. Rather, as distinct from biological sex, gender is socially produced. Overlaid on biological sex, gender is a broad term that shapes and interacts with one's cognition to guide norms, roles, behaviors, and social relations. It is a fluid construct that varies across time, place, and life stage. Gender can interact with biological sex and, indeed, other social determinants, such as ethnicity and socioeconomic position, to shape cardiovascular health from conception, through early life when health behaviors and risk factors are shaped, into adolescence and adulthood. This article will illustrate how gender shapes the early adoption of health behaviors in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood by focusing on physical activity, drinking, and smoking behaviors (including the influence of role modeling). We will also discuss the role of gender in psychosocial stress with a focus on trauma from life events (childhood assault and intimate partner violence) and work, home, and financial stresses. We conclude by exploring potential biological pathways, with a focus on autonomic functioning, which may underpin gender as a social determinant of cardiovascular health. Finally, we discuss implications for cardiovascular treatment and awareness campaigns and consider whether gender equality strategies could reduce the burden of CVD for men and women at the population level.",2018-01-01,Journal,Article,Circulation,22581,123,137,Gender/sex as a social determinant of cardiovascular risk,1,true,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028595,Lippincott Williams and Wilkinskathiest.clai@apta.org,Circulation,2018.0,107.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This article will illustrate how gender shapes the early adoption of health behaviors in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood by focusing on physical activity, drinking, and smoking behaviors (including the influence of role modeling) and explores potential biological pathways, with a focus on autonomic functioning, which may underpin gender as a social determinant of cardiovascular health.'}",1049,1401331304,A.

Gender differences in experienced trauma types, PTSD symptom clusters, and PTSD risk factors are unclear. We aimed to address this gap using a cross-sectional design. A sample of 991 civilians (522 women, 469 men) from South Lebanon was randomly selected in 2007, after the 2006 war. Trauma types were grouped into disaster and accident, loss, chronic disease, non-malignant disease, and violence. PTSD symptom clusters involved re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions and mood, and arousal. These were assessed using parts I and IVof the Arabic version of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Risk factors were assessed using data from a social support and life events questionnaire in multiple regression models. Females were twice as likely as males to score above PTSD threshold (24.3 vs. 10.4%, p < 0.001). Total scores on all trauma types were similar across genders. Females scored higher on all symptom clusters (p < 0.001). Social support, social life events, witnessed traumas, and domestic violence significantly were associated with PTSD in both genders.

Methods: This quasi-experimental study compared gender-based violence and antepartum depression scores of 288 pregnant women in the two arms; one exposed to a psychosocial intervention and another receiving usual antenatal care. We used analysis of covariance to estimate the intervention effect and Chi-square to test the equality of proportions. Results: The difference between the psychosocial intervention and the usual antenatal care group in the total intimate partner violence and physical violence scores was a significant, with small effect sizes of partial eta = 0.196 and 0.305 respectively. The two arms did not differ in terms of the proportion of women reporting other acts of gender-based violence by intimate and non-intimate partners post-intervention.

Additional studies, however, indicate that the alcohol–IPV link is neither simple nor necessarily direct and that a range of factors may moderate this relationship. Using a national, community-based sample of 255 men, the present study examined the moderating effects of ambivalent sexism (i.e., hostile and benevolent sexism) on the relationship between alcohol use and IPV perpetration. The findings show that both greater alcohol consumption and high hostile sexism are positively associated with IPV perpetration, and that hostile sexism moderates the alcohol–IPV relationship for perpetration of physical IPV, but not for psychological IPV. Moreover, high levels of alcohol consumption have a greater impact on physical IPV perpetration for men low in hostile sexism than for men high in hostile sexism, lending support to the multiple threshold model of the alcohol–IPV link.

1060,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.Police violence has been identified as a public health concern in the U.S., yet few studies have assessed the prevalence and nature of police violence among women. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that women reporting intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) to police are often met with harmful or neglectful police responses and thus, women's exposures to police violence may be associated with experiences of IPV and SV; however, this has not yet been empirically tested. This study assesses lifetime prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of police violence among women and investigates potential associations between IPV, SV, and police violence. A cross-sectional survey was administered in four Eastern U.S. cities in March and April 2016 (N = 932). Physical, sexual, and psychological police victimization and neglect by police were assessed. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between IPV, SV, and police violence, adjusting for sociodemographics. Lifetime prevalence of physical (4%), sexual (3.3%), and psychological (14.4%) police violence and neglect (17.2%), show that a notable proportion of women experience police victimization, with significantly higher rates among racial and ethnic minority women. Women with IPV and SV histories had increased odds of experiencing most forms of police violence compared to women without IPV and SV histories.

1061,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: The aim of this study was to compare sociodemographic characteristics, patterns of drug use, and risky sexual behaviour among female and male users of crack cocaine. Methods: Between 2012 and 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 919 crack cocaine users (783 men and 136 women) in Central Brazil using face-to-face interviews. Blood samples were collected to test for syphilis. The Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) was used to explore the differences between genders. We implemented two models: the first model included previous incarceration and variables related to patterns of drug use, and the second model included variables related to sexual risky behaviours and syphilis exposure. Results: Women consumed more crack cocaine than men on a regular basis; however, poly-drug use was more common among men. More women than men reported exchanging sex for money and/or drugs and inconsistent condom use during sexual intercourse; women also reported more sexual partners. In addition, the frequency of sexual violence was higher for women than men. A higher proportion of women than men were positive for syphilis (27.2% vs. 9.2%; p < 0.001).

1062,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Studies have shown that youths with high psychopathic traits have an earlier onset of delinquent behavior, have higher levels of delinquent behavior, and show higher rates of recidivism than youths with low psychopathic traits. Furthermore, psychopathic traits have received much attention as a robust indicator for delinquent and aggressive behavior in both boys and girls. However, there is a notable lack of research on gender differences in the relationship between psychopathic traits and delinquent behavior. In addition, most of the studies on psychopathic traits and delinquent behavior were conducted in high-risk samples. Therefore, the first objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between psychopathic traits and specific forms of self-reported delinquency in a high-risk sample for juvenile delinquency as well as in a general population sample. The second objective was to examine the influence of gender on this relationship. Finally, we investigated whether the moderating effect of gender was comparable in the high-risk sample for juvenile delinquency and the general population sample. Methods: Participants were 1220 adolescents of the German-speaking part of Switzerland (N = 351 high-risk sample, N = 869 general population sample) who were between 13 and 21 years of age. The Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory (YPI) was used to assess psychopathic traits. To assess the lifetime prevalence of the adolescents' delinquent behavior, 15 items derived from a self-report delinquency instrument were used. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between gender, psychopathic traits and self-reported delinquency across both samples. Results: Our results demonstrated that psychopathic traits are related to non-violent and violent offenses. We found no moderating effect of gender and therefore we could not detect differences in the moderating effect of gender between the samples. However, there was a moderating effect of sample for the relationship between the callous and unemotional YPI scale and non-violent offenses. In addition, the regression weights of gender and sample were, for non-violent offenses, reduced to non-significance when adding the interaction terms. Conclusions: Psychopathic traits were found to be present in a wide range of youths (i.e., high-risk as well as general population sample, young children as well as adolescents, boys as well as girls) and were related to delinquent behavior. The influence of age and YPI scales on self-reported delinquency was more robust than the influence of gender and sample.

These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (Mage = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences.

1068,"© 2017 by the authors.Deaths by suicide in Bangladesh have an atypical sex ratio, with higher rates in females than in males-a characteristic shared with several countries in Southern Asia. Reasons for this are explored in this paper. An examination of the social structure of Bangladesh suggests that girls and women are subjected to higher rates of sexual and physical violence compared with males, especially in rural and urban slum areas. This violence is often linked to the enforced marriage of young girls to older men. A systematic review of 24 studies on suicide and suicidal behaviors in Bangladesh has shown that suicide death rates are exceptionally high in younger women, at a rate of about 20 per 100,000, more than twice the rate in males aged less than 49. In girls aged 15 to 17, the estimated suicide rate is 14 per 100,000, 50% higher than in males. Because of problems in obtaining systematic data on deaths by suicide, these rates are likely to be underestimates. Extreme poverty and lack of education have been recorded as factors in deaths by suicide, although there are methodological problems in reaching such conclusions. We speculate that some of the ""suicides"" (especially those using poison) may in fact be cases of murder. A dowry system (not sanctioned by Islam) is thought to be a major cause of family poverty, and violence experienced by young girls. In proposing solutions, we argue the case (as Muslims) for the support of an Islamic feminism which urges better support for girls growing up in extreme poverty.",2017-11-14,Journal,Article,Social Sciences,21100810500,12,6,High rates of suicide and violence in the lives of girls and young women in Bangladesh: Issues for feminist intervention,1,true,10.3390/socsci6040140,MDPI AGPostfachBaselCH-4005,,2017.0,100.0,0.0,,1068,2407629,C.

1069,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Globally, prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5. Many efforts have focused on clinical approaches to improve the survival of premature babies. There is a need, however, to explore psychosocial, sociocultural, economic, and other factors as potential mechanisms to reduce the burden of prematurity. Women's empowerment may be a catalyst for moving the needle in this direction. The goal of this paper is to examine links between women's empowerment and prematurity in developing settings. We propose a conceptual model that shows pathways by which women's empowerment can affect prematurity and review and summarize the literature supporting the relationships we posit. We also suggest future directions for research on women's empowerment and prematurity. Methods: The key words we used for empowerment in the search were ""empowerment,"" ""women's status,"" ""autonomy,"" and ""decision-making,"" and for prematurity we used ""preterm,"" ""premature,"" and ""prematurity."" We did not use date, language, and regional restrictions. The search was done in PubMed, Population Information Online (POPLINE), and Web of Science. We selected intervening factors-factors that could potentially mediate the relationship between empowerment and prematurity-based on reviews of the risk factors and interventions to address prematurity and the determinants of those factors. Results: There is limited evidence supporting a direct link between women's empowerment and prematurity. However, there is evidence linking several dimensions of empowerment to factors known to be associated with prematurity and outcomes for premature babies. Our review of the literature shows that women's empowerment may reduce prematurity by (1) preventing early marriage and promoting family planning, which will delay age at first pregnancy and increase interpregnancy intervals; (2) improving women's nutritional status; (3) reducing domestic violence and other stressors to improve psychological health; and (4) improving access to and receipt of recommended health services during pregnancy and delivery to help prevent prematurity and improve survival of premature babies. Conclusions: Women's empowerment is an important distal factor that affects prematurity through several intervening factors. Improving women's empowerment will help prevent prematurity and improve survival of preterm babies.

This includes war, terrorism, homicides, assaults and domestic violence against women and children. The cost of conventionally defined interpersonal violence, that is, homicides and assault, are about 7.5 times higher than the cost due to war and terrorism. I also estimate the costs of non-fatal domestic violence against children and women and suggest that these costs are much higher than the combined costs of homicide, assault, terrorism and war. The main reason is that the prevalence of these types of violence is very high: possibly as many as 16 per cent of all children are punished using violent methods and about 12 per cent of all women experience intimate partner violence. Richer societies have lower levels of violence, and there is evidence that prevalence rates have been declining over time. However, it is often unclear why this is the case. Much of the evidence from violence reducing interventions comes from high-income countries, and it is uncertain whether these programs would be similarly effective in low- and middle-income countries.

The relationship between alcohol use and violence has been established and can be explained by the level of intoxication. Given the occurrence of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems at sporting events, research has assessed intoxication levels measured through biological sampling among spectators. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the level of alcohol intoxication among spectators at football matches in the Swedish Premier Football League. Spectators were randomly selected and invited to participate in the study. Alcohol intoxication was measured with a breath analyser for Blood Alcohol Concentration levels, and data on gender, age, and recent alcohol use were gathered through a face-to-face interview. Blood Alcohol Concentration samples from 4420 spectators were collected. Almost half (46.8%) had a positive Blood Alcohol Concentration level, with a mean value of 0.063%, while 8.9% had a Blood Alcohol Concentration level 0.1%, with a mean value of 0.135%.

1074,"© 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.Who participates in political violence? In this study, we investigate the issue at the micro-level, comparing individuals who have used violence in political uprisings with those who have not. We develop our argument from the observation that men are strongly overrepresented in political violence, although most men do not participate. Literature on masculinities emphasizes the role of honor and its links to different forms of violence, such as domestic abuse, criminal violence, and violent attitudes. Building on this literature, we discern two separate but related aspects of honor: honor as male societal privilege and control over female sexuality, that is, patriarchal values, and honor as ideals of masculine toughness, that is, the perceived necessity for men to be fierce and respond to affronts with violence or threats of violence in order to preserve status. We argue that patriarchal values combined with ideals of masculine toughness together constitute honor ideology, which contributes in turn to the explanation of who participates in political violence. We present new and unique individual-level survey data on these issues, collected in Thailand. We find that honor ideology strongly and robustly predicts a higher likelihood of participating in political violence among male political activists. A number of previous studies found a macro-level relationship between gender equality and peacefulness in a society.

1075,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdThis systematic review of reviews synthesizes evidence on the impact of interventions to prevent violence against adolescent girls and young women 10–24 years (VAWG) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Theories of women's empowerment and the social ecology of multifaceted violence frame the review. Child abuse, female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC), child marriage, intimate partner violence (IPV), and sexual violence were focal outcomes. Our review followed the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) for the systematic review of reviews, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for a systematic review of recent intervention studies. Of 35 reviews identified between June 7 and July 20, 2016, 18 were non-duplicate systematic reviews of medium-to-high quality. Half of these 18 reviews focused on interventions to prevent IPV. Only four focused on adolescents, of which three focused on child marriage and one compared findings across early and late adolescence. None focused on interventions to prevent child abuse or sexual violence in adolescent/young women. From these 18 reviews and the supplemental systematic review of intervention studies, data were extracted on 34 experimental or quasi-experimental intervention studies describing 28 interventions. Almost all intervention studies measured impacts on one form of VAWG. Most studies assessed impacts on child marriage (n = 13), then IPV (n = 8), sexual violence (n = 4), child abuse (n = 3), and FGMC (n = 3). Interventions included 1–6 components, involving skills to enhance voice/agency (n = 17), social networks (n = 14), human resources like schooling (n = 10), economic incentives (n = 9), community engagement (n = 11) and community infrastructure development (n = 6). Bundled individual-level interventions and multilevel interventions had more favorable impacts on VAWG. Interventions involving community engagement, skill-building to enhance voice/agency, and social-network expansion show promise to reduce VAWG. Future interventions should target poly-victimization, compare impacts across adolescence, and include urban, out-of-school, married, and displaced/conflict-affected populations in LMICs, where VAWG may be heightened.",2017-11-01,Journal,Review,Social Science and Medicine,18983,56,192,Preventing gender-based violence victimization in adolescent girls in lower-income countries: Systematic review of reviews,0,false,10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.08.038,Elsevier Ltd,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2017.0,83.0,4.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This systematic review of reviews synthesizes evidence on the impact of interventions to prevent violence against adolescent girls and young women 10-24 years (VAWG) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and shows promise to reduce VAWG.'}",1075,118734332,K.

1076,"© 2017Evidence has revealed interesting associations of clinical and social parameters with violent behaviors of patients with psychiatric disorders. Men are more violent preceding and during hospitalization, whereas women are more violent than men throughout the 3 days following a hospital admission. It has also been proven that mental disorders may be a consistent risk factor for the occurrence of violence. In order to better understand violent behaviors of patients with psychiatric disorders, it is important to investigate both the clinical symptoms and psychosocial factors that accompany violence in these patients. In this study, we utilized a dataset released by the Partners Healthcare and Neuropsychiatric Genome-scale and RDoC Individualized Domains project of Harvard Medical School to develop a unique text mining pipeline that processes unstructured clinical data in order to recognize clinical and social parameters such as age, gender, history of alcohol use, and violent behaviors, and explored the associations between these parameters and violent behaviors of patients with psychiatric disorders. The aim of our work was to demonstrate the feasibility of mining factors that are strongly associated with violent behaviors among psychiatric patients from unstructured psychiatric evaluation records using clinical text mining. Experiment results showed that stimulants, followed by a family history of violent behavior, suicidal behaviors, and financial stress were strongly associated with violent behaviors.

1077,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.Introduction Eye injury is the second most common cause of visual impairment and a leading cause of monocular blindness in the United States. There are approximately 6 million ED visits related to drug use annually, including misuse or abuse of pharmaceuticals and illicit drug use. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between ocular trauma and substance abuse among emergency department patients and to assess that relationship with demographic factors, including age and gender. Methods This study was a retrospective, observational study conducted at Miami Valley Hospital, an urban hospital ED, in Dayton, Ohio. Eligible participants included consecutive ocular trauma patients identified by the Trauma Registry from January 2014 through January 2016. Data were collected from the ED medical record including demographic information, mechanism of injury, visual acuity, slit lamp exam findings, ED procedures, inpatient procedures, toxicology results, ED diagnosis, ED disposition, and eye exam. Results Among 229 patients, the mean age was 44 (range 14–93). 73% of patients were male. Most patients were White (74%), followed by African American (21%), Hispanic (2%), and other (3%). Most patients arrived by ambulance (62%), followed by helicopter (30%), and walk-ins (18%). Most patients were admitted to the hospital (79%). Mechanisms of injury included motor vehicle accidents (31%) and cases of assault (28%). Most ocular trauma involved the external eye (44%), the anterior chamber (28%), the orbit (25%) and the globe (22%). The incidence of substance abuse in this patient population was high. Of the patients tested for alcohol (N = 143), 49% tested positive. Among 98 patients who received a urine toxicologic screen, 63% tested positive for at least one illicit substance, including opiates (39%), cocaine (12%), benzodiazepines (25%), and/or THC (27%). There was no significant association between substance abuse and ED disposition. Conclusion Mechanisms of eye injury included primarily motor vehicle accidents and assault.

1079,"© 2017 Taylor & Francis.Differences in gender and age have been established in the context of crime, violence, and prevalence of risk and protective factors. These studies are often notable only in the Western Hemisphere. Despite growth in crime and violence in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), relatively little understanding of violence in CARICOM member states exists. In light of these concerns, the major purposes of this study include: (1) comprehensively assessing the scope of the four behaviors (i.e., engagement, victimization, witness, and report) in relation to violence and youth’s perceptions of risk and protective factors in family and school domains, and (2) examining how they differ by youth’s gender and age. This study draws on assessment data on youth violence in five CARICOM Member States: Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago using a completed 51-item quantitative questionnaire from approximately 512 students. The results suggest that violence engagement, victimization, witness, and report significantly differed by gender and age. Male students were more likely to engage in violence, but less likely to report such violence to adults. Similarly, older students reported that they were more likely to engage in and witness violence. For risk and protective factors, female students reported significantly higher scores on domestic violence, whereas male students had higher scores on the access to drugs/weapons. Older students also tended to report higher levels of some school risk factors and lower levels of some protective factors in both family and school.",2017-10-03,Journal,Article,Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment,12247,6,27,Comprehensive assessment of youth violence in five Caribbean countries: Gender and age differences,2,,10.1080/10911359.2016.1273811,Routledgeaabs@uw.edu,,2017.0,71.0,1.0,,1079,1403751341,Carolyn Gentle-Genitty,1918349313,Jangmin Kim,10722012,E.

1080,"© 2017 The Society for Italian Studies.This article reads two feminist literary works on gender violence, Maraini’s Donna in guerra (1975) and Schiavo’s Macellum (1979), through the lens of the political discourse that the Italian feminist movement developed in relation to the issue of rape in the late 1970s. Adopting the classification offered by Johan Galtung’s theory on direct, structural and cultural violence, as well as Pierre Bourdieu’s theorization on symbolic violence, this essay aims at pinpointing ideological differences between Maraini’s and Schiavo’s narratives. In particular, it argues that, if Donna in guerra denounces direct and structural abuses on women, thus calling for institutional change, Macellum is an accusation against a cultural violence that cannot be fought with the tool of law. Maraini’s and Schiavo’s approaches, which mirror the standpoints of different factions of the movement of the time, are then considered in relation to Teresa de Lauretis’ ideas on the structure of feminist thought and politics, in order to illustrate that both approaches are in fact essential for the subversion of violent sexist dynamics.",2017-10-02,Journal,Article,Italian Studies,6500153184,2,72,Beyond rape: Dacia maraini’s Donna in guerra and Maria schiavo’s Macellum in the 1970s Italian feminist debate on gender violence,0,false,10.1080/00751634.2017.1372975,Taylor and Francis Ltd.maney@maney.co.uk,,2017.0,0.0,0.0,,1080,114020432,Nicoletta Mandolini,,,,,,,,,,,17.0,11.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology

1082,"© Washington School of Psychiatry.Objective: We assessed in vivo symptom courses of early psychological responses during war and investigated the influence of exposure, gender, and a prior diagnosis of severe mental illness (SMI). Method: Participants were 181 highly exposed individuals from the general population and community psychiatric rehabilitation centers. A 30-day twice-daily Internet-smartphone-based intensive assessment two weeks into the 2014 Israel–Gaza war estimated peritraumatic symptom clusters, sense of threat, negative emotions and cognitions, and siren exposure during two periods that varied in exposure level. Piecewise growth curve modeling procedures were performed. Results: We found different courses for most variables, gender, and SMI status. Women were more reactive two weeks into the war but reduced their reactivity level at a faster pace than males, reaching lower symptom levels one month later. Women’s courses were characterized by arousal, negative emotionality, sense of threat, and reactivity to siren exposure. No-SMI men had a stable course followed by a significant reduction in arousal, negative emotions, avoidance, and perceived threat during a “return to routine” lower-level intensity period of the war. Individuals with SMI had higher reactivity levels at study onset; but while women with SMI improved over time, men with SMI worsened. SMI reactivity was characterized by negative cognitions, intrusions, and avoidance. Conclusions: Early reactions during prolonged exposure to war are variable, dynamic, and affected by exposure context. Symptoms, emotions, and cognitions develop differentially over time and are affected by gender and mental health status.

We describe the conflict experiences of men and women from the general population of Bougainville Papua New Guinea, perceptions of the enduring impact of conflict, and the associations between these and the major health and development problems on the islands: mental ill-health and violence against women. Methods: Fourteen years after the end of the decade long civil war, we conducted a household survey with a random sample of adult (n = 864) men and (n = 879) women living in Bougainville. The interviews were mostly conducted face-to-face, with very sensitive questions self-completed. Results: Mental ill-health was highly prevalent, 37.8% of women and 32% of men had high levels of depressive symptomatology, 34.4% of men abused alcohol and 15.1% of women and 24.6% of men had high levels of PTSD symptoms. Among women, 23.3% had been raped in the year prior to the interview and 33.3% had experience physical or sexual partner violence. The prevalence of exposure to trauma during the civil war was very high and many of the men and women experienced lingering impact of conflict. Multiple logistic regression models showed that war trauma was associated with PTSD symptoms in women and PTSD symptoms, alcohol abuse and depressive symptoms in men. The perceived enduring impact of conflict was associated with depressive symptoms in men and women, problem drinking and suicidal thoughts in women and drug use in men. The perceived enduring conflict impact was associated with perpetration of past year rape and physical and/or sexual partner violence.

We aimed to provide a hospital-based view of injuries in Shiraz considering victims' age and gender, using administrative data from trauma research center. A cross-sectional registry-based study of adult trauma patients (age ≥15 years) sustaining injury through traffic accidents, violence, and unintentional incidents was conducted. Information was retrieved from 3 hospital administrative databases. Data on demographics, injury mechanisms, injured body regions, and injury descriptions; outcomes of hospitalization; and development of nosocomial infections were recorded. Injury Severity Score (ISS) was calculated by crosswalking from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) injury diagnosis codes to AIS-98 (Abbreviated Injury Scale) severity codes. Patients were compared based on age groups and gender differences. A total of 47,295 trauma patients with a median age of 30 (interquartile range: 24-44 years) were studied, of whom 73.1% were male and the remaining 26.9% were female (M/F=2.7:1.0). The most common injury mechanisms in the male group were car and motorcycle accidents whereas females were mostly victims of falls and pedestrian accidents (P<.01). As age increased, a shift from transportation-related to unintentionally caused injuries occurred. Overall, young men had their most severe injuries on head, whereas elderly women suffered more severe extremity injuries. Injury severity was similar between men and women; however, elderly had a significantly higher ISS. Although incidence of nosocomial infections was independent of victims' age and gender, elderly men had a significantly higher mortality rate.

These two forms of violence share similar risk factors and often, but not always, co-occur at the household level. Parenting programs have shown promise in reducing physical child punishment. Targeting men has also been proven effective in transforming attitudes related to gender roles and expectations and intimate partner violence (IPV) against women.

However, no study has analyzed the outcome of GCS in a eudaimonic perspective, nor explored eudaimonic well-being before GCS. The study compares the eudaimonic well-being of trans men (N = 56) and women (N = 89) before and after GCS; in the MtF sample, a further comparison was carried out between those who never started any medical intervention and those who were already taking CSH. Finally, the impact of experiences of harassment, discrimination and violence on eudaimonic well-being in the post-surgery sample was explored.

1090,"© 2017, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd. All rights reserved.Introduction: Gender-based violence (GBV) is faced by many women in Nepal but health-seeking behavior is rare. A reproductive health facility may be the only place where a woman comes for a health visit. So, health care providers, especially gynecologists, play an important role to identify women suffering from GBV as they see clients suffering from the reproductive health effects of GBV on a daily basis. The purpose of this study was to find the prevalence and severity of GBV in women attending the outpatient department (OPD) and to compare their clinical diagnosis with those not facing GBV. Materials and methods: This is a prospective study conducted at Lumbini Medical College Teaching Hospital for a period of 3 months enrolling 741 nonpregnant women attending the OPD. A structured questionnaire was used for interview to identify women facing abuse and to assess their gynecological problems. Results: Out of 741 women, 172 faced GBV, so the prevalence was 23.21%. Emotional and physical abuse was the most common type of abuse faced by 56 (32.56%), but the severity was reported more in sexual abuse [8 (57.14%)]. Pain abdomen was the most common symptom [69 (40.12%)], and chronic pelvic pain (CPP) [60 (34.89%)] was the commonest clinical diagnosis made in these women. Chronic pelvic pain was diagnosed more in women facing abuse (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, about one in four women in reproductive age group had experienced GBV.

1091,"© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.Introduction South Africa is a country known for its high levels of HIV infection and sexual violence. Although the interface between gender-based violence, HIV and mental health has been described, there are substantial gaps in knowledge of the medium-term and long-term health impact. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease study excluded many health outcomes associated with rape and other forms of gender-based violence because systematic reviews revealed huge gaps in data and poor evidence of health effects. This study aims to describe the incidence and attributable burden of physical and mental health problems (including HIV acquisition) in adult women over a 2-year postrape period, through comparison with a cohort of women who have not been raped. The study will substantially advance our understanding of the impact of rape and will generate robust data to assist in the development of postrape health services and the delivery of evidence-based care. Methods and analysis This longitudinal study seeks to recruit 1008 rape-exposed and 1008 rape non-exposed women. Women were recruited from health services, and assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. Outcome measures include exposure to risk factors; mental health status; cardio-metabolic risks; and biomarkers for HIV, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy and stress. The primary analysis will be to compare HIV incidence in the two groups using log-rank tests. Appropriate models to predict health outcomes over time will also be applied. Ethics and dissemination The South African Medical Research Council's Ethics Committee approved the study. As rape is a key element of the study, the safety and protection of participants guides the research process. We will adopt a research uptake strategy to ensure dissemination to policy makers, service providers and advocacy groups. Peer-reviewed journal articles will be published.",2017-09-01,Journal,Article,BMJ Open,19800188003,13,7,Study protocol for a longitudinal study evaluating the impact of rape on women's health and their use of health services in South Africa,1,true,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017296,BMJ Publishing Groupsubscriptions@bmjgroup.com,BMJ Open,2017.0,79.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The incidence and attributable burden of physical and mental health problems in adult women over a 2-year postrape period is described, through comparison with a cohort of women who have not been raped, to substantially advance understanding of the impact of rape.'}",1091,3535742,N.

1092,"© 2017 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.To determine whether the injury mortality prediction (IMP) statistically outperforms the trauma mortality prediction model (TMPM) as a predictor of mortality. The TMPM is currently the best trauma score method, which is based on the anatomic injury. Its ability of mortality prediction is superior to the injury severity score (ISS) and to the new injury severity score (NISS). However, despite its statistical significance, the predictive power of TMPM needs to be further improved. Retrospective cohort study is based on the data of 1,148,359 injured patients in the National Trauma Data Bank hospitalized from 2010 to 2011. Sixty percent of the data was used to derive an empiric measure of severity of different Abbreviated Injury Scale predot codes by taking the weighted average death probabilities of trauma patients. Twenty percent of the data was used to create computing method of the IMP model. The remaining 20% of the data was used to evaluate the statistical performance of IMP and then be compared with the TMPM and the single worst injury by examining area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) statistic, and the Akaike information criterion. IMP exhibits significantly both better discrimination (ROC-IMP, 0.903 [0.899-0.907] and ROC-TMPM, 0.890 [0.886-0.895]) and calibration (HL-IMP, 9.9 [4.4-14.7] and HL-TMPM, 197 [143-248]) compared with TMPM. All models show slight changes after the extension of age, gender, and mechanism of injury, but the extended IMP still dominated TMPM in every performance. The IMP has slight improvement in discrimination and calibration compared with the TMPM and can accurately predict mortality.

1093,"© 2017 Taylor & Francis.Using a mixed-methods approach, we explored how college women’s lifetime experiences of physical or sexual gender-based violence (GBV) were associated with appraisals of GBV and their feminist beliefs or identity (N = 32). Women commented on their increased awareness of the prevalence of GBV, their desire to help other women, and their beliefs about the trustworthiness of men and the current state of gender equality. Women who perceived no or minimal influence of sexism on GBV attributed their GBV experiences to a flaw in themselves or the perpetrators (i.e., self-blame, poor vigilance) or as a reasonable disciplinary measure for their ‘misbehavior.’ We also found that some women reported agreement with pro-feminist beliefs, yet rejected a feminist identity. Our findings illustrate how feminist stigma and sexism might prevent women who endorse core feminist beliefs from characterizing GBV as a sexist event. Given the potential harmful consequences of GBV and other forms of sexism, connecting women with meaningful resources, such as empowering educational programs, nurturing peer-to-peer women’s support groups, and awareness campaigns, may help to facilitate sisterhood and alleviate distress.

Setting and design: Consultation with experts and young people was used as part of a UK scoping review to capture current thinking and practice on the use of media campaigns to address interpersonal violence and abuse among young people. Three focus groups and 16 interviews were undertaken with UK and international experts, and three focus groups were held with young people. Main results: Participants argued that, although campaigns initially needed to target whole populations of young people, subsequently, messages should be “granulated” for subgroups including young people already exposed to interpersonal violence and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people. It was suggested that boys, as the most likely perpetrators of interpersonal violence and abuse, should be the primary target for campaigns. Young people and experts emphasized that drama and narrative could be used to evoke an emotional response that assisted learning. Authenticity emerged as important for young people and could be achieved by delivering messages through familiar characters and relevant stories. Involving young people themselves in creating and delivering campaigns strengthened authenticity. Conclusions: Practice is developing rapidly, and robust research is required to identify the key conditions for effective campaigns in this field.

1100,"© 2016 John Wiley & Sons LtdAims and objectives: To describe the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of nurses and midwives who have attended to women who suffered violence. This study further analyses the possible changes of attitude that have occurred over the past five years. Background: Gender violence or violence against women is the largest problem with regard to public health and violated human rights all over the world. In Italy, it is estimated that 31·5% of women suffer physical or sexual violence during their life. Healthcare operators play a crucial role in recognising the signs of the violence suffered when taking care of victims. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Methods: A questionnaire was administered; this was used in a previous survey of a convenience sample of 51 nurses and midwives who work in an emergency room or in an obstetrics emergency room and gynaecological ward. Results: Of the respondents, 51 (80·4%) have taken care of women who suffered violence, and 25 (49%) believe they can detect violence. The relational/communicative approach presents the most difficulty, and all the operators believe they need more knowledge. The number of operators who suggest women be observed in an emergency room and file a complaint or who primarily consider listening to women has decreased. A tendency to ‘blame’ women, although decreasing, persists; it is higher among male nurses and, in general, among male operators. Conclusion: Knowledge of this issue has not been completely recognised among operators despite training and the emergence of the phenomenon in the mass media. Difficulties in receiving and in relational procedures continue to exist, in addition to ‘blaming’ the woman. Relevance to clinical practice: Awareness paths and cultural changes regarding the phenomenon of violence need to be developed, as does a specific training programme on the approach to and assessment of the abused woman.",2017-08-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Clinical Nursing,28191,9,26,"Violence against women: knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of nurses and midwives",0,false,10.1111/jocn.13625,Blackwell Publishing Ltdcustomerservices@oxonblackwellpublishing.com,Journal of Clinical Nursing,2017.0,48.0,0.0,,1100,144542872,D.

However, no evidence-based interventions are available to reduce patients' vulnerability. An exploration of the characteristics of physical and sexual violence can provide valuable information to support the development of interventions for these patients. This study aimed to examine gender differences in characteristics of violent victimization in patients with dual diagnosis. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey study recent incidents of physical and sexual assault were examined with the Safety Monitor in 243 patients with dual diagnosis. Chi-square tests were used to examine gender differences in the prevalence of physical and sexual victimization. Fisher's exact tests and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine whether there were significant differences between victimized men and women with regard to perpetrators, locations, reporting to the police and speaking about the assault with others. Results: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of physical violence in men (35%) and women (47%) with dual diagnosis. There was a significant association between gender of the victim and type of perpetrator (P < .001). Men were most often physically abused by a stranger or an acquaintance, whereas women were most frequently abused by an (ex)partner. Sexual violence was more prevalent in women (29%) compared to men (4%) (P < .001). Patients with dual diagnosis were unlikely to report incidents of physical abuse and sexual assault to the police and to speak about it with caregivers. Conclusions: Characteristics of physical violence are different for men and women with dual diagnosis. Women with dual diagnosis are more often victims of sexual violence compared to men.

1102,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem with devastating effects on young women's health. These negative effects increase when the exposure to IPV lasts for a long time and exposure at an early age increases the risk of adult IPV. Despite efforts made in the last few decades, data show little progress has been made towards its reduction. Thus, the aim of the study reported here is to explore professionals' perceptions regarding intimate partner violence (IPV) among young people, focusing on the characteristics of the phenomenon and their perceptions about existing programmes and campaigns aimed at addressing it. Methods: Twelve professionals from education, health and municipal social services were interviewed. All but one of the interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed according to the methodology of inductive thematic analysis, with the support of Atlas.ti software. The transcripts were read several times and coded line by line. Afterwards, codes were grouped into themes. The developed themes were refined into two phases with the participation of all the authors. Results: From the analysis, the following three themes were identified: ""A false sense of gender equity"", ""IPV among young people: subtle, daily and normalized"", and ""Mass media campaigns do not fit young people's needs"". According to the participants, psychological abuse in the form of controlling behaviour by their partners is the most common type of IPV young women are exposed to, although exposure to other types of IPV was also acknowledged. This violence was described as something subtle, daily and normalized and, consequently, not something that is easy to recognize for the girls that are exposed to it, nor for adults working with young people. Conclusions: The study participants showed good knowledge of the characteristics IPV has among young people. This knowledge was reflected in locally implemented IPV prevention projects, which they considered successful in addressing young people's needs. However, these interventions lacked formal evaluation, political support and continuation. The study participants did not believe that nationwide mass media campaigns realistically reflected the specific characteristics of IPV among young people. Thus, participants perceived these campaigns to be ineffective.",2017-07-20,Journal,Article,Reproductive Health,144680,8,14,Professionals' perception of intimate partner violence in young people: A qualitative study in northern Spain,1,true,10.1186/s12978-017-0348-8,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,Reproductive Health,2017.0,67.0,0.0,,1102,7851519,A.

Even less is known about how these groups compare with other violent populations. This study examined how gang members, gang affiliates, and violent men compare on mental health symptoms and traumatic experiences. Method: Data included a sample of 1,539 adult males, aged 19 to 34 years, taken from an earlier survey conducted in the United Kingdom. Participants provided informed consent before completing questionnaires and were paid £5 for participation. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare participants’ symptoms of psychiatric morbidity and traumatic event exposure. Results: Findings showed that, compared to violent men and gang affiliates, gang members had experienced more severe violence, sexual assaults, and suffered more serious/life-threatening injuries. Compared to violent men, gang members and gang affiliates had made more suicide attempts; had self-harmed more frequently; and had experienced more domestic violence, violence at work, homelessness, stalking, and bankruptcy. Findings further showed a decreasing gradient from gang members to gang affiliates to violent men in symptom levels of anxiety, antisocial personality disorder, pathological gambling, stalking others, and drug and/or alcohol dependence. Depression symptoms were similar across groups. Conclusions: The identified relationship between gang membership, affiliation, and adverse mental health indicates that mental health in gang membership deserves more research attention.

Method: Two hundred and forty-nine schoolchildren (53% female; age 9-12 years) completed the self-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD). Two statistical models were tested, predicting conduct problems (CP) and prosocial behavior (PB). In the first one, CU traits and gender were entered into the equation. The second model added narcissism and impulsivity. Results: Gender, narcissism and impulsivity, but not CU, were statistically significant predictors of CP in the second model (F3,226 = 45.07, p < 0.001, R2 = 43.7%; betas: gender = -0.20, narcissism = 0.29, impulsivity = 0.36, CU = 0.06).

Results The prevalence of abuse in this pediatric emergency room was 0.6%. Physical violence predominated (69.4%), followed by sexual violence (39.3%). Exploratory profiles of these types of violence were constructed. Regarding physical violence, the gender of the abuser was the first differentiating dimension; the victim's gender and age range were the second one. In the case of sexual violence, the age of the abuser and co-residence with him/her comprised the first dimension; the victim's age and gender comprised the second dimension.

Methods We identified 4988 teachers participating in the Finnish Public Sector study who reported encountering violence at work. Disturbed sleep was measured in three waves with 2-year intervals: the wave preceding exposure to violence, the wave of exposure and the wave following the exposure. Data on procedural and interactional justice were obtained from the wave of exposure to violence. The associations were examined using repeated measures log-binomial regression analysis with the generalised estimating equations method, adjusting for gender and age. Results Exposure to violence was associated with an increase in disturbed sleep (RR 1.32 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.52)) that also persisted after the exposure (RR 1.26 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.48)). The increase was higher among teachers perceiving the managerial practices as relatively unfair (RR 1.46 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.09) and RR 1.59 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.42) for interactional and procedural justice, respectively). By contrast, working in high-justice conditions seemed to protect teachers from the negative effect of violence on sleep. Conclusion Our findings show an increase in sleep disturbances due to exposure to workplace violence in teaching. However, the extent to which teachers are treated with justice moderates this association.

Our study seeks to understand how women in the West Bank (occupied Palestinian territories) conceptualise, experience and manage their health in the midlife. We generated qualitative evidence using in-depth life history interviews in 2015 with women (n = 35) living in the West Bank, analysed thematically. Women's understandings of good health draw on indigenous and biomedical knowledge and include a calm psychological state, ease of movement, as well as physical appearance and complexion. Exposure to political violence was understood as impacting mental and physical well-being. Most women articulated a positive view about midlife and ageing as a natural process. A range of terms and expressions were suggested by women experiencing this transition, internalised differently according to marital and motherhood status. For many women, the menopause was merely one – often relatively unimportant – aspect of changes associated with ageing. In dealing with midlife health issues women used multiple strategies, or health pluralism, sequentially or simultaneously; drawing on multiple sets of accrued resources.

Data for this study were obtained from the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health dataset. A total of 2038 children and adolescents aged 8–18 years (M = 12.49; SD = 2.88, 61.1% males) were analyzed. Binary logistic regression was fitted to identify predictors of non-suicidal self-injury as a function of adverse childhood experiences, depression, and social support while simultaneously controlling for age, gender, type of patient, legal guardianship, marital status of parents/caregivers, history of foster family placement, and mental health diagnoses. Of the 2038 children and adolescents examined, 592 (29%) of this clinical sample engaged in non-suicidal self-injury. In the multivariate logistic regression model, children and adolescents who were physically abused had 49% higher odds of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury and children and adolescents who were sexually abused had 60% higher odds of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury, when compared to their non-abused counterparts. Other predictors of non-suicidal self-injury include: older age, female gender, inpatient status, depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorder, and mood disorders. Children and adolescents who had some form of social support had a 26% decrease in the odds of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury. Assessment procedures for indicators of mental health, particularly among children and adolescents with a history of adverse childhood experiences, should also take into account non-suicidal self-injury.

To that end, we consider the relationship between IPV and TBI; the difficulty in detecting and measuring the IPV-related TBI and ethical concerns that may arise when addressing this issue.

1116,"Copyright © The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.Epistemologies of ignorance describe how ignorance influences the production of knowledge. Advancing an intersectional epistemologies of ignorance approach that examines how conscious (or unconscious) ignorance about racism, heterosexism, and classism shapes empirical knowledge about Black men’s sexualities, we conducted a critical review of the behavioral and social science research on U.S. Black men, ages 18 and older, for two time frames: pre-1981 and the most recent decade, 2006–2016. Our search yielded 668 articles, which we classified into five categories: sexual violence, sexual experiences and expressions, sexual identities, cultural and social-structural influences, and sexual health and sexual risk. We found that most of the research, particularly pre-1981, centered the experiences of White heterosexual men as normative and implicitly constructed Black men as hypersexual or deviant.

The objective is to identify priorities for OSH research that may contribute to the achievement of present and future sustainable growth objectives set by the European strategies. Methods The study was carried out using a modified Delphi method with a two-round survey. Each round involved a panel of about 110 researchers representing the network member institutes was selected according to specific criteria, including the ownership of research expertise in at least one of the four macroareas identified by the reference report developed by EU-OSHA in 2013. Results The study identified some innovative research topics (for example, Emerging technological devices' and OSH consequences of markets integration') and research priorities (ie, crowdsourcing, e-work, zero-hours contracts) that are not reflected in previous studies of this nature. The absence of any reference to violence and harassment at work among the researchers' proposals is a major difference from previous similar studies, while topics related to gender issues and electromagnetic fields show a lower importance.

Therefore, the relationships between different forms of self-esteem (global self-esteem, social rank, social fit, and attractiveness) and aggression were investigated in a sample of young care leavers. For men, high levels of social rank and high levels of attractiveness were predictive of aggression, whereas for women low levels of perceived social inclusion and low levels of attractiveness were predictive of aggression.

1122,"© 2015 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdAim: Men and women have historically been shown to differ in their presentation and outcome of psychotic disorders and thus are likely to have different treatment needs. It is unclear whether Early Intervention Services (EIS) are able to provide equitable care for both men and women presenting for the first time with psychosis. The main aim of this study was to explore gender differences for first-presentation psychosis patients at the time of their referral to inner-city EIS and their outcomes 1 year later. Methods: Audit data were utilized from 1098 first-presentation psychosis patients from seven EIS across London, UK, collected via the computerized MiData package. Binary logistic regression was employed to detect potential associations between gender and (i) initial clinical presentation (including duration of untreated psychosis, pathways to care, risk behaviours); and (ii) 1-year clinical and functional outcomes. Results: At entry to EIS, male patients presented with more violent behaviour whereas female patients had more suicide attempts. Following 1 year of EIS care, men still presented as more violent towards others whereas women were more likely to have been admitted to a psychiatric ward. Conclusion: Gender differences in clinical outcome, service use and risk behaviours were apparent within the first year of specialist psychosis care. This may be partly due to the different pathways to care taken by men and women and differences in clinical presentation.

The article explores differences across the 28 European Union (EU) Member States in terms of coercive control and type of violence used. The results—based on data from the first EU–wide survey on violence against women by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights—are further considered in terms of their association with gender equality. The results show that, in the EU, violence against women perpetrated under coercive control differs from other forms of violence as it involves more serious forms of violence and has a bigger impact in terms of its varied consequences. Countries where women indicated lower levels of coercive control are shown as scoring higher on a measure of gender equality, in contrast with earlier interpretations of the survey findings concerning the relationship between survey measures of physical and/or sexual violence and gender equality.

However, important questions remain regarding whether the type of violence exposure, the experience of one or both forms, the chronicity of violent experiences, and the age, gender, and SES of the child, differentially influence developmental outcomes. Data on 2810 children from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods were analyzed. Children aged 3–9 at the outset were assessed three times, at 3-year intervals. Primary caregivers reported on IPV, PCPA, and children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms were examined as a function of time, age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and the time-varying effects of cumulative IPV and PCPA exposure. Cumulative experiences of IPV and PCPA each adversely affected the developmental trajectories of both externalizing and internalizing symptoms, but in different ways; and they did so independently of participants’ age, gender, or SES, which all functioned as significant, independent predictors of child outcomes. PCPA was by far the more potent of the two forms of violence; and when both forms occurred, they worked additively to affect outcomes.

Methodology This observational, retrospective, descriptive and analytical study was conducted from 15 October 2014 to 15 April 2015. It covered all the court records of victims of intentional injury from 2006 to 2015. The data was entered and analyzed using Epi info 3.3.2 software. Results In all, 113 cases were treated. The mean age was 26.5 ± 10.08 years for victims versus 32.5 ± 13.8 years for the aggressors. The victims were all female, and 77.9% of offenders were male. The assaults took place mostly during the day (57.5%), and especially in the homes of victims (61.0%), in the street (16.8%) in the bush (12.4%). The consultation period was less than 24 hours for 54.9% of the victims. Clinical examination differentiated: fractures (15%); contusions (13.5%); penetrating wounds (10.6%); bruises (9.7%); eye injuries (7.9%); broken teeth (7.9%); diffuse pains (7.1%), 6.2% polytrauma (6.2%), and 5.3% of trauma on pregnancies. Among the violence, 33.6% were domestic; 11.5% were associated with rape (7.1%); psychological violence (3.6%); rape and death threat (1.8%). Rape was statistically more common among child victims [OR = 10.7 (3.2–35.5)] and/or educated victims [OR = 5.8 (1.7–19.9)] and aggression in the bush [OR = 7.5 (2.2 to 14.2)].

We examined how sexualization may make women seem lacking moral patiency and moral virtue both of which may lead to a reduced willingness to help. In the first study, participants read a fictitious newspaper article describing an IPV incident. They were then presented with a picture of the ostensible victim depicting the woman with either a sexualized or non-sexualized appearance. Participants judged both the victim's moral patiency and morality, and then expressed their willingness to provide help to that victim. Although the sexualized victim was viewed as a lesser moral patient (Studies 1 and 2) and as less moral (Study 2), it was seeing the victim as unworthy of moral patiency rather than lacking moral virtue (immoral) that linked sexualization to reduced help.

This study sought to associate participants’ beliefs about IPV held during childhood with their adjustment as adults, and to compare their beliefs from childhood to their beliefs in early adulthood. Method: A nationally representative sample of 703 Swedish young adults reported on their past and present beliefs about the causes of their parents’ IPV. Standardized measures assessed their mental health (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress symptoms) and the quality of their relationships as adults. Results: The most common explanations for IPV were that the perpetrator suffered from physical or mental illness, had relationship problems, or was distressed. Participants were less likely to blame themselves for IPV or to believe that the perpetrator was cruel when they were adults, compared to their reports of themselves as children. Women were more likely to attribute mental or physical illness as the cause of the perpetrator's IPV.

1130,"© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper examines the representation of sexual violence in Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen. The comic book was published between 1986 and 1987 by DC Comics–and later collected into one volume in 1987–and is set in an alternative reality, conceptually converging with points in history spanning from the 1930s to the 1980s. Watchmen hinges, on a number of levels, on the (alleged) rape of Silk Spectre by the Comedian in the early 1940s, an event shown as a flashback within the narrative. Although forming a short part of the comic book, and taking up a minimal number of frames, the episode of sexual violence is proposed in Watchmen as the conceptual fulcrum on which much of the narrative pivots, as well as the conceptual dynamics between the vigilante characters and their identification with the ‘United States’ as an entity. In my analysis, I connect sexual violence to notions of disrupted memory, collective historical narrative, (un)patriotism, and the ‘nation’ as a gendered entity. Ultimately, this paper uncovers how Watchmen exposes the well-known dichotomous metaphor of ‘women/nation’ as conflicted and warped. The politics of nationalism and patriotism are conflated with the aesthetics of gender representation, and the violated body as a contested social, cultural, and historical space.",2017-05-04,Journal,Article,Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics,19900191801,5,8,"‘For God’s sake, cover yourself’: sexual violence, disrupted histories, and the gendered politics of patriotism in Watchmen",0,false,10.1080/21504857.2017.1307869,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,,2017.0,20.0,0.0,,1130,1413926486,L.

After that, they were asked to identify the motivations of each partner and estimate the seriousness of what occurred, the number of aggressions described and the frequency of this kind of episode in real life. The results showed that the men and women properly identified the motivations underlying the aggressive behaviours, considered control violence more serious than reactive violence, and perceived more of the first kind of aggression. However, the men estimated a lower frequency of these episodes in real life, especially episodes of control violence. The ambivalent sexism of the men is related to these assessments.

1134,© 2017 Elsevier LtdThis article critically reviews the literature on gender differences in intimate partner violence. The review reveals that many researchers view partner violence as an opportunity to learn about gender. This approach is examined and its limitations are pointed out. A reverse approach is proposed which views the study of gender as an opportunity to learn about partner violence. This alternative approach identifies gender motives in general and moves on to explore the expressions of these motives in violent and non-violent intimate relationships. Theoretical and practical implications for this alternative approach are suggested. An important implication is the moderating effect of the proposed approach on the ongoing controversy over the role of gender in partner violence.,2017-05-01,Journal,Review,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,9,34,Studying partner violence to understand gender motivations - or vice-versa?,0,false,10.1016/j.avb.2017.01.022,Elsevier Ltd,,2017.0,63.0,0.0,,1134,6460206,Z.

However, the proximal associations between ACEs and behavioral outcomes during the middle childhood years have been understudied. In addition, many of the ACE studies contain methodological limitations such as reliance on retrospective reports and limited generalizability to populations of lower socioeconomic advantage. The current study uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a national urban birth cohort, to prospectively assess the adverse experiences and subsequent behavior problems of over 3000 children. Eight ACE categories to which a child was exposed by age 5 were investigated: childhood abuse (emotional and physical), neglect (emotional and physical), and parental domestic violence, anxiety or depression, substance abuse, or incarceration. Results from bivariate analyses indicated that Black children and children with mothers of low education were particularly likely to have been exposed to multiple ACE categories.

1136,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Preventing intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a global public health challenge. Studies suggest urban informal settlements have particularly high levels of IPV and HIV-prevalence and these settlements are rapidly growing. The current evidence base of effective approaches to preventing IPV recognizes the potential of combining economic strengthening and gender transformative interventions. However, few of these interventions have been done in urban informal settlements, and almost none have included men as direct recipients of these interventions. Methods: Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention is a participatory gender transformative and livelihoods strengthening intervention. It is being evaluated through a cluster randomized control trial amongst young women and men (18-30) living in urban informal settlements in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa. The evaluation includes a qualitative process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. A comparison of baseline characteristics of participants is also included. Discussion: This is one of the first large trials to prevent IPV and HIV-vulnerability amongst young women and men in urban informal settlements.

1142,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdObjective Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy can have serious health consequences for mothers and newborns. The aim of the study is to explore: 1) the influence of experiencing IPV during pregnancy on delayed entry into prenatal care; and 2) whether women's decision-making autonomy and the support for traditional gender roles act to mediate or moderate the relationship between IPV and delayed entry into prenatal care. Design cross-sectional survey. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated that control for various socio-demographic and pregnancy related factors to assess whether women who experienced IPV during pregnancy were more likely to delay entry into prenatal care compared with women who had not experienced IPV. The influence of traditional gender roles acceptance and decision-making autonomy were examined both as independent variables and in interaction with IPV, to assess their role as potential mediators or moderators. Setting Chandpur district, Bangladesh. Participants the sample comprised of 426 Bangladeshi women, aged 15–49 years. Postpartum mothers who visited vaccinations centres to receive their children's vaccinations constitute the sampling frame. Results almost 70% of the women surveyed reported patterns consistent with delayed entry into prenatal care. Accounting for the influence of other covariates, women who experienced physical IPV during pregnancy were 2.61 times more likely (95% CI [1.33, 5.09]) to have delayed entry into prenatal care than their counterparts who did not report physical IPV. Neither sexual nor psychological IPV victimization during pregnancy was linked with late entry into prenatal care. Both gender role attitudes and levels of autonomy mediate the effect of IPV on prenatal care. Key conclusions the results suggest that the high rates of IPV in Bangladesh have effects that can compromise women's health seeking behaviour during pregnancy, putting them and their developing fetus at risk. Specifically, Bangladeshi women who experience physical IPV during pregnancy are more likely to delay or forgo prenatal care, an effect that is further magnified by cultural ideals that emphasize women's traditional roles and limit their autonomy. Implications for practice this study reinforces the need to detect and assist women suffering IPV, not only to offer them help and support but also to increase entry into prenatal care.

Design An observational multicenter study. Settings Three Spanish hospitals during 2015. Participants 141 pregnant women in which information is collected sociodemographic variables and data related to pregnancy, labor, and puerperium were gathered by interview and from clinical records. Comparisons of means and logistic regression analyses were performed, calculating crude and adjusted odds ratios.

1144,"© 2016, The Author(s).Intergroup contact—(positive) interactions with people from different social groups—is a widely researched and strongly supported prejudice-reducing mechanism shown to reduce prejudice against a wide variety of outgroups. However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped. Thus, the present research is the first known to show that contact could be a potential tool to combat sexism, rape myth acceptance, intentions to rape in men, and sexualisation of rape by women.",2017-04-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,21,76,"Contact with Counter-Stereotypical Women Predicts Less Sexism, Less Rape Myth Acceptance, Less Intention to Rape (in Men) and Less Projected Enjoyment of Rape (in Women)",1,true,10.1007/s11199-016-0679-x,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,Sex Roles,2016.0,0.0,0.0,,1144,9757371,Miriam Taschler,35636580,Keon West,,,,,,,,,2.0,22.0,2.0,63.0,1191.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1145,"© 2016 American Psychological Association.Objective: The goals of the present review were to determine the prevalence of physical and sexual TDV among adolescents, obtain the rates of teen dating violence (TDV) separately by gender, and examine the potential moderation effects of age, demographics, and measurement. Method: A systematic literature search elicited 101 studies reporting rates for youth aged 13 to 18. Results: Meta-analytic combination produced an overall prevalence of 20% for physical TDV and 9% for sexual TDV. Significant variability in rates was found, with physical TDV ranging from 1% to 61% and sexual TDV ranging from <1% to 54%. Gender differences in physical TDV were significant for perpetration (boys 13% vs. girls 25%) but not for victimization (21% boys and girls). A different pattern was observed for sexual TDV with girls reporting lower rates of perpetration compared with boys (3% vs. 10%) and higher rates of victimization (14% vs. 8%). Moderator analyses revealed higher rates in samples representing higher proportions of older teens (sexual TDV), cultural minority girls (physical TDV), and disadvantaged neighborhoods (physical TDV). Studies using broad measurement tools yielded higher rates of both forms of TDV across gender. Conclusions: Basing the meta-analysis on a large pool of studies with comparable samples, 1 in 5 adolescents reported physical TDV and roughly 1 in 10 reported sexual TDV. Systematic bias in boys' and girls' self-reports was evident along with high variability in TDV rates across studies and significant moderator influences. These findings are suggestive of substantive methodological challenges in extant studies.

In this study, we'll study specific acts from female teenagers. Method The corpus of clinical interviews and discussions gathered among teen girls living in educational institutions was crossed with psychological psychoanalytical and criminal studies allowing us to focus on the specificity of violent acting from girls. Result The evidence of precocious trauma along with the narcissistic dimension of delictuous acting in front of “boys eyes” stand in the foreground. Previous or recent depressive symptoms, anxiety about loss are the main constants among young girls with various psychological operating ways. Discussion We observe a real defect of structuring identifications. Mother identification basis of feminine identification appears to be extremely fragile. Resorts to acting of this population would be anchored here in an appeal dimension to the object and would be linked to an adaptative regression. Conclusion If resorts to violent acting from teen aged girls are revealing of problems inherent to teen aged, these young girls express it in a specific way linked to what they receive from the outside world: their womanhood and its treatment through traumatic experiments. One of its specifities thus residing in a blurred border between resort to acting against oneself and against others.

Further, how the processes of control that are considered coercive differ from control dynamics that are part of all relationships remains uncertain. Thus, we used grounded theory methods to develop a theoretical explanation of the processes of control and what makes control coercive. Method: In-depth interviews with 22 divorced women were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding and constant comparative methods. Power and gender theories offered sensitizing frameworks. Results: ""Felt or experienced constraint"" was central to the process of control, but 2 distinct patterns produced this phenomenon. Constraint through commitment involved a process of being constrained by oneself or one's partner to uphold cultural conventions of heterosexual marriage and parenting. Constraint through force involved a process of being controlled wholly in a targeted and systematic way by one's partner.

1152,"© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Drawing on qualitative interviews with young women in the UK, this article highlights how gendered and sexualised negotiations of visibility intersect and continue to be important in the ways in which young women self-regulate bodies and identities to manage risk in the Night Time Economy (NTE). Adopting visible markers of normative, heterosexual femininity on a night out can be understood as simultaneously mitigating against the risks of experiencing certain types of harassment, whilst increasing the risks of experiencing others. This article reaffirms the relevance of negotiations of visibility in shaping non-heterosexual women’s dress as a strategy for managing the risk of homophobic abuse and demonstrates some of the ways in which all young women–regardless of actual or perceived sexual identification–are required to police their bodies in order to manage the additional risks of ‘heterosexualised’ harassment in the NTE. These include threats of sexual violence and harassment primarily associated with women’s positioning as subordinated gendered subjects rather than with the policing of ‘non-normative’ sexualities, with findings suggesting that young women are more concerned with managing the risks associated with a heterosexualised male gaze rather than a homophobic gaze. ‘Everyday’ experiences of harassment are trivialised and normalised in bar and club spaces, and adopting markers of normative, heterosexual femininity was felt to increase the risks of receiving this kind of ‘unwanted attention’.

Two common domains of trauma, network trauma and gender based violence (GBV), may contribute to this gender difference in PTSD rates. We examined data from a nationally representative sample of the Australian population to clarify the characteristics of these two trauma domains in their contributions to PTSD rates in men and women. Methods We drew on data from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-being to assess gender differences across a comprehensive range of trauma domains, including (1) prevalence of lifetime exposure; (2) identification of an index trauma or DSM-IV Criterion A event; and (3) the likelihood of developing full DSM-IV PTSD symptoms once an index trauma was identified. Results Men reported more traumatic events (TEs) overall but women reported twice the prevalence of lifetime PTSD (women, 13.4%; men, 6.3%). Women reported a threefold higher level of exposure to GBV and were seven times more likely to nominate GBV as the index trauma as compared to men. Women were twice more likely than men to identify a network trauma as the index trauma and more likely to meet full PTSD symptoms in relation to that event (women, 20.6%; men, 14.6%). Conclusion Women are more likely to identify GBV and network trauma as an index trauma. Women's far greater exposure to GBV contributes to their higher prevalence of PTSD. Women are markedly more likely to develop PTSD when network trauma is identified as the index trauma.

1156,"© 2016 Elsevier Masson SASIntroduction In France, the decision to request an autopsy, when a medicolegal obstacle is put, is up to the magistrate responsible of an inquiry. It is proven that the practice of an autopsy reduces the risk of error in determining the mode and cause of death. In spite of the suppression in 2011 of the per-act charge of autopsies, budgetary considerations still exist, especially according to the distance between the place of death and the place where the autopsy is practiced. The purpose of this study was to compare the circumstances of death whether they occurred in remote or close to the place of the autopsy. Methods The whole of autopsy reports from the Grenoble, Nancy and Toulouse medicolegal institutes were gathered and anonymized. Data about the demanding court, the type of death, the age and gender of the deceased and the pathological cause of death were entered. The International Classification of Diseases codes were used to determine the causes of death. The main test hypothesis was that the repartition between violent and non-violent types of death was different between close and remote jurisdictions from the medicolegal institute. Comparisons between observed and expected data were driven using the chi-square test. Results Seven hundred and forty-four reports written in 2012 were analyzed. It was not observed any significant difference allowing validating the main hypotheses: autopsies for violent death required by close jurisdictions were as many as 278, versus 243 in remote jurisdictions, and non-violent deaths respectively 134 and 84 autopsies (P [Chi2] = 0.09). Only the sub-group results in the Grenoble region were significant. It was pointed out that, regarding the number of deaths, more autopsies were practiced in jurisdictions close to the medicolegal institutes, around 16.2 autopsies for 1000 deaths, versus 8.3 for autopsies required by distant jurisdictions. The studied material, in terms of sex-ratio and mean age, was comparable with those of other works in this subject. Conclusion This studied did not show a significant difference between jurisdictions distant or close to the medicolegal institutes, regarding the circumstances of death, however the number of autopsies according to the number of deaths is greater for the areas where the autopsies are practiced.",2017-02-01,Journal,Article,Revue de Medecine Legale,19700175261,0,8,Does distance influence the demand for autopsies?

Bem (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31, 634–643, 1975) argued that gender role is an important predictor of mental health, and this relationship may differ for males and females due to societal gender norms. Given the gendered nature of IPV, we examined whether gender role interacted with gender to predict behavior problems in IPV-exposed children (n = 176). Among four-year-old children, gender-typed gender roles were a risk factor for girls but not boys, and androgynous gender roles were protective for both boys and girls on average. However, post hoc analyses indicated the amount of IPV exposure mattered; androgynous girls exposed to chronic IPV had more behavior problems.

All rights reserved.Those interested in understanding personal and family violence will quickly identify the topic as highly politicized and controversial, particularly in the context of gender. Domestic violence tends to be conceptualized as a gendered crime-one that is mainly perpetrated against women and, to a lesser extent, children. This notion ignores research that women perpetrate violence against partners and children at similar rates to men. This chapter explores the gender debate and the biases and stereotypes that work against male victims of partner violence. In particular, it presents analyses of a set of narratives from the perspective of male victims. An understanding of the dynamic and interactive nature of family violence and its sociopolitical influences can reveal why men so often fail to report partner violence.

1159,"© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Scholars, states and international organizations have begun to systematically count, document and compare sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in conflict-affected countries. Qualitative and quantitative studies point to a “tip of the iceberg” phenomenon, where there is a high prevalence but low level of actual reporting of SGBV. We investigate the conditions in which SGBV is reported or, more significantly, is not reported to discover the trends of reporting in politically oppressive environments where SGBV is thought to be occurring. We ask how the power to report in local conflict-affected areas is affected by national political tensions and pervasive gender discrimination. Reporting of SGBV in Myanmar, a country that has experienced multiple, protracted conflicts since independence, is examined. Analysis of open-access reports over a fifteen-year period reveals a pattern of silence that we argue is rooted in pervasive discriminatory civil and physical practices against women.

1160,"Background Substantial mental health disparities between lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals compared with heterosexuals have been identiﬁed. The aim was to examine potential sexual orientation-based disparities in mental health treatment in a prospectively analysed population-based sample in Sweden and to explore potential moderators and mediators. Method 30 730 individuals from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort were followed up with questionnaires and registry-based health record data on psychiatric healthcare visits and prescription drug use between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011. Results In adjusted analyses, gay and lesbian individuals were more likely to receive treatment for anxiety disorders (adjusted ORs (AOR)=3.80; 95%CI 2.54 to 5.69) and to use antidepressant medication (AOR=2.13; 95%CI 1.62 to 2.79); and bisexuals were more likely to receive treatment for mood disorders (AOR=1.58; 95%CI 1.00 to 2.48), anxiety disorders (AOR=3.23; 95%CI 2.22 to 4.72) and substance use disorders (AOR=1.91; 95%CI 1.12 to 3.25), and to use antidepressant medication (AOR=1.91; 95%CI 1.12 to 3.25) when compared with heterosexuals. The largest mental health treatment disparities based on sexual orientation were found among bisexual women, gay men and younger lesbian women. More frequent experiences of victimisation/threat of violence and lack of social support could partially explain these disparities. Conclusions This study shows a substantially elevated risk of poor mental health among LGB individuals as compared with heterosexuals.

1162,"© Centre for Gender and Violence Research, University of Bristol.Gender is the most pervasive classification of individuals and thus strongly defines couple relationships. Cultural discourses on couple relationships reproduce hierarchical gender differences, and couple distress is often linked to gendered power inequalities. At worst, gender is the basis for intimate partner violence (IPV). Generally, however, therapeutic interventions do not address the issues of gender and gendered power. This paper discusses the meaning and functions of gender in the context of couple therapy, in particular for IPV. It is argued that the therapist needs to be skilled in discursive deconstruction to be able not only to address the client’s situation as an individual experience but also to locate it in the wider social and cultural context.

Even though young men are among those most at risk of exposure to physical violence, men’s victimization is only recognized to a limited extent. The aim of this study is to deepen our understanding of how social workers’ interpretation of the position of males in the gender order affects their understanding of male victimization. The study was designed as a multiple case study with a qualitative comparative approach. Focus group interviews supported by vignettes were used to collect data. Interviews were carried out with professional Swedish social workers working with victimized men and women at centres for young crime victims in Sweden. The results show that even though the social workers express traditional gender beliefs about young men’s experiences of victimization and their inability to identify themselves as victims of violence, they also to some extent resist taken-for-granted notions of male victimization. The results also show that the social workers to some extent offer supportive measures that reinforce traditional expectations of masculinity. On the basis of the results it is suggested that one important way of developing social work with young male victims of violence would be to give greater attention to variations between different men and masculinities and how these different forms of masculinity are differently connected to crime and violence, and to adapt supportive measures to reflect these differences.",2017-01-01,Journal,Article,Nordic Social Work Research,21101075277,2,7,The significance of position for Swedish social workers’ understanding of young men’s victimization of violence,0,false,10.1080/2156857X.2016.1192056,UBM Exhibition Singapore PTE LTD,,2017.0,82.0,0.0,,1174,14248711,Christian Kullberg,77847297,Mikael Skillmark,,,,,,,,,40.0,189.0,9.0,15.0,45.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology

1179,"© 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how raters combine constituent components of Historical Clinical Risk-20 (HCR-20) risk assessment, and how relevant they rate the tool to different diagnostic and demographic groups. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey design of n=45 mental health clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, and others) working in a secure hospital responded to an online survey about their risk assessment practice. Findings: HCR-20 Historical and Clinical subscales were rated the most relevant to violence prediction but four of the five items rated most relevant were Historical items. A recent history of violence was rated more important for risk formulation than Historical and Risk management items, but not more important than Clinical items. While almost all respondents believed predictive accuracy would differ by gender, the tool was rated similarly in terms of its relevance for their client group by people working with men and women, respectively. Research limitations/implications: This was an exploratory survey and results should be verified using larger samples. Practical implications: Clinicians judge recent violence and Clinical items most important in inpatient violence risk assessment but may overvalue historical factors. They believe that recent violent behaviour is important in risk formulation; however, while recent violence is an important predictor of future violence, the role it should play in SPJ schemes is poorly codified. Social implications: It is important that risk assessment is accurate in order to both protect the public and to protect patients from overly lengthy and restrictive detention.

1181,"© 2017 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.In the current study, we examined the role of parent- child support as a protective factor that moderates the correlation between exposure to neighborhood violence and perpetration of moderate physical violence among 3,187 Arab-Palestinian adolescents who live in Israel (aged 12 to 18), from 21 different schools who were selected randomly. The probability sampling method was a nonproportional multistage stratified cluster sample. We also examined gender differences across this protective process. Participants completed a structured, anonymous self-report questionnaire. The findings of the study reveal that 47.3% of the adolescents had perpetrated moderate physical violence against others at least once during the month preceding the study. Moreover, exposure of adolescents to violence in their neighborhood correlated significantly and positively with perpetration of moderate physical violence. A moderation analysis was tested and found that this correlation was stronger among adolescents who had poor parent- child support than among those who had strong parent- child support. Furthermore, the findings reveal that the correlation of exposure to neighborhood violence with perpetration of moderate physical violence was not moderated by gender.

Also, to list the common barriers that dentists face when managing DV victims. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a self-administered, structured questionnaire was sent randomly to dentists practicing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The online survey link was emailed with a cover message that illustrated the study context. Responses were accepted from January 2016 until the end of February 2016.

Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analysis carried out to identify significant variables at p<0.05 level of significance. Results: A sample size of 151 responses were recruited. The result of multivariate models indicated that the odds of dentists’ awareness and taking actions towards DV victims were influenced by their education, clinical experience, gender, practicing sector, and qualification.

IPV experiences and use have not previously been studied among the newest generation of women veterans who deployed to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Method: This study examined the correlates of IPV in a sample of 102 women veterans who had deployed to the conflicts in Iraq or Afghanistan and who were in current intimate relationships. Using an anonymous web-based survey, participants completed measures of combat and sexual harassment exposure during deployment, measures of mental health and substance abuse, intimate relationship satisfaction, and recent IPV. Results: Results indicated that 63% of the sample reported experiencing any IPV in the past 6 months, whereas 73% reported using IPV toward their partner in the past 6 months. Linear regressions indicated intimate relationship satisfaction explained significant variance in recent psychological IPV, whereas alcohol misuse and recent psychological IPV experiences explained significant variance in physical IPV experiences and use and sexual IPV experiences. Conclusion: Women veterans in this study reported high levels of recent IPV experiences as well as the use of IPV.

1185,"© 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.This community-based observational study of 1,325 women seen for antenatal care examined how women in Pakistan define violence against women (VAW), with an emphasis on domestic violence, what an acceptable response to violence is, reasons for remaining silent, and whether participants are willing to disclose incidents of domestic violence to others. Nearly half of the study participants believed that physical violence was VAW. Verbal abuse, controlling behavior by the husband, conflict with in-laws, overburdening domestic work, and threatening to leave or remarry were also considered VAW. However, only five respondents (0.4%) considered sexual abuse to be VAW. Most women who screened positive for domestic violence responded by remaining silent or verbal fighting back. None sought professional help. Women who decided to remain silent feared that the abuse would escalate or that responding would not help them. Women cited social stigma and concerns about the impact of the violence on children as reasons for not disclosing violent incidents to others or seeking professional help. Women’s lack of autonomy further reduced their ability to take steps against violence. Although societal norms, particularly patriarchal beliefs and women’s subordination to men, likely explain women’s tolerance of abuse, their recognition of physical abuse as violence indicates that they do not necessarily believe it is always justified.

Although alcohol use is a known trigger of IPV in opposite sex relationships, less is known about alcohol use and IPV perpetration and victimization in same-sex couples. The aim of this study was to examine associations between alcohol use and different types of IPV victimization and perpetration among MSM. Methods: MSM in New York City were recruited at gay-friendly venues and events to participate in an online survey assessing sociodemographics, alcohol use, and victimization/perpetration of IPV with both regular and casual sex partners.

Background: Although sexual minority men experience intimate partner violence at least as often as do heterosexuals, there is currently limited knowledge of intimate partner violence in this community or resources for sexual minority men who experience intimate partner violence. Design: Cross-sectional design. Method: Sexual minority men (N = 89) were recruited as part of a national online survey and completed questionnaires assessing lifetime experiences of intimate partner violence as well as various coping strategies. In terms of intimate partner violence, 34·8% of participants reported having been targets of sexual abuse, 38·2% targets of physical abuse, 69·7% targets of psychological abuse and 28·1% had experienced an injury as a result of intimate partner violence during their lifetime. Results: Canonical correlation analyses found that intimate partner violence victimisation explained 32·5% of the variance in adaptive and 31·4% of the variance in maladaptive coping behaviours. In the adaptive coping canonical correlation, standardised loadings suggested that sexual minority men who experienced intimate partner violence resulting in injury were more likely to use religious coping, but less likely to use planning coping. In the maladaptive coping canonical correlation, sexual minority men who had been targets of intimate partner sexual victimisation and intimate partner violence resulting in injury tended to engage in increased behavioural disengagement coping. Conclusion: This study revealed several coping behaviours that are more or less likely as the severity of different forms of intimate partner violence increases.

1197,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdIn the literature, a crash-based modeling approach has long been used to evaluate the factors that contribute to cyclist injury risk at intersections. However, this approach has been criticized as crashes are required to occur before contributing factors can be identified and countermeasures can be implemented. Moreover, human factors related to dangerous behaviors are difficult to evaluate using crash-based methods. As an alternative, surrogate safety measures have been developed to address the issue of reliance on crash data. Despite recent developments, few methodologies and little empirical evidence exist on bicycle-vehicle interactions at intersections using video-based data and statistical analyses to identify associated factors. This study investigates bicycle-vehicle conflict severity and evaluates the impact of different factors, including gender, on cyclist risk at urban intersections with cycle tracks. A segmented ordered logit model is used to evaluate post-encroachment time between cyclists and vehicles. Video data was collected at seven intersections in Montreal, Canada. Road user trajectories were automatically extracted, classified, and filtered using a computer vision software to yield 1514 interactions. The discrete choice variable was generated by dividing post-encroachment time into normal interactions, conflicts, and dangerous conflicts. Independent variables reflecting attributes of the cyclist, vehicle, and environment were extracted either automatically or manually. Results indicated that an ordered model is appropriate for analyzing traffic conflicts and identifying key factors. Furthermore, exogenous segmentation was beneficial in comparing different segments of the population within a single model. Male cyclists, with all else being equal, were less likely than female cyclists to be involved in conflicts and dangerous conflicts at the studied intersections. Bicycle and vehicle speed, along with the time of the conflict relative to the red light phase, were other significant factors in conflict severity. These results will contribute to and further the understanding of gender differences in cycling within North America.",2016-12-01,Journal,Article,Accident Analysis and Prevention,19532,43,97,Investigating the gender differences on bicycle-vehicle conflicts at urban intersections using an ordered logit methodology,0,false,10.1016/j.aap.2016.07.033,Elsevier Ltd,Accident Analysis and Prevention,2016.0,38.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Male cyclists, with all else being equal, were less likely than female cyclists to be involved in conflicts and dangerous conflicts at the studied intersections, and an ordered model is appropriate for analyzing traffic conflicts and identifying key factors.'}",1197,7515303,Joshua Stipancic,14245850,Sohail Zangenehpour,1398324575,L.

1199,"© 2016 Elsevier España, S.L.U.Aim To determine the knowledge and attitudes of nurses in Primary Care as regards gender violence and their relationship with socio-demographic factors and cases detected. Design Cross-sectional, descriptive study. Location Urban health centres. Participants A total of 167 nurses working in Primary Care. Main measurements A questionnaire was used that included questions related to knowledge, knowledge perception and attitudes to gender violence attitudes. Variables such as age, gender, marital status, work place and health area were also analysed. Results The response rate was 114 (68.26%). The percentage of correct responses in the knowledge questions was 62.2%, with a medium level of knowledge being observed. Married nurses or couples living in a stable relationship obtained a higher score (95.2%, P = .077). The low detection (29%) is associated with marital status (P = .004), low knowledge (P = 0,008), low knowledge perception (P = .001), lack of training (P = .03) and non-implementation of the gender violence protocol (P = .001). Nurses with low self-perception of their knowledge implement the protocol less often (OR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.1-0.7), and they consider that the lack of training is the main problem in determining the diagnosis (OR = 11.24; 95% CI: 1.5-81.1). Conclusions The level of knowledge was adequate. Nurses have a lack of confidence in terms of their knowledge about gender violence. The detection and diagnosis attitudes are more related to self-perception of levels of knowledge than their real knowledge. Marital status influences the level of knowledge.

The aim of this article is to explore violence among an understudied group of women, who attended Mutual-Aid Residential Centers for Addiction Treatment and experienced stigma both as women and addicts. These centers are particular kind of addiction treatment services that stem from 12-step philosophy, but that have been found to manipulate said philosophy and exercise extreme forms of psychological and physical violence. Methods: Thirteen semi-structured interviews were carried in 2014 and 2015 out with women who resided in at least one of these centers to understand their experiences of violence prior and during their rehabilitation process. The interview guide covered questions regarding substance use initiations, family violence and dynamics, and rehabilitation experiences. Qualitative data was analyzed using interpretative-phenomenological analysis. Results: Two categories emerged: violence and substance use and abuse, and violence against women in recovery. Results show that all participants experienced violence in their family since childhood, particularly sexual and physical violence. As a result, participants experienced guilt, sadness and shame, which led them to contexts of consumption. Violence continued as they explored alcohol and drug use, even though women felt empowered.

1201,"© 2016 The Author(s).Background: Living in conditions of chronic adversity renders many women more vulnerable to experiencing gender-based violence (GBV). In addition to GBV's physical and social consequences, the psychological effects can be pervasive. Access to evidence-based psychological interventions that seek to support the mental health of women affected by such adversity is rare in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: The current study evaluates a brief evidence-informed psychological intervention developed by the World Health Organization for adults impacted by adversity (Problem Management Plus; PM+). A feasibility randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted to inform a fully powered trial. Community health workers delivered the intervention to 70 women residing in three peri-urban settings in Nairobi, Kenya. Women, among whom 80% were survivors of GBV (N = 56), were randomised to receive five sessions of either PM+ (n = 35) by community health workers or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU; n = 35). Results: PM+ was not associated with any adverse events. Although the study was not powered to identify effects and accordingly did not identify effects on the primary outcome measure of general psychological distress, women survivors of adversity, including GBV, who received PM+ displayed greater reductions in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms following treatment than those receiving ETAU. Conclusions: This feasibility study suggests that PM+ delivered by lay health workers is an acceptable and safe intervention to reach women experiencing common mental disorders and be inclusive for those affected by GBV and can be studied in a RCT in this setting.

1202,"© 2016 The Author(s).Background: Although some studies examined the moderating role of gender in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and mental disorders later in life, a number of them examined the effects of only one or two types of maltreatment on an individual mental disorder, for instance, depression, substance use. It is of considerable clinical and theoretical importance to have in-depth understanding what roles of different types of childhood abuse play out in a wide range of mental disorders among women and men using well accepted instruments measuring abuse and mental disorders. The present study aimed to examine this issue using a large nationally representative population sample to explore the gender effect of different types of childhood abuse in mental disorders, and assess the moderating role of gender in the abuse-mental disorder relationship. Methods: Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2012: Mental Health we sought to answer this question. Respondents with information on childhood maltreatment prior to age 16 were selected (N=23, 395). Results: We found: i) strong associations between childhood abuse frequency and gender; ii) significant differences between men and women in terms of mental disorders; iii) strong associations between childhood abuse and mental disorders; and, iv) gender moderated the role of childhood abuse history on adulthood mental disorders. Females with a history of sexual abuse and/or exposure to interpersonal violence were at a greater risk of alcohol abuse or dependence later in life. Conclusions: Intervention should occur as early as possible, and should help female victims of childhood sexual abuse and/or exposure to interpersonal violence, and their families to build more constructive ways to effectively reduce the negative affects of these experiences.

1203,"Introduction: Maternal mortality is a potentially preventable public health issue. Maternal morbidity is increasingly of interest to aid the reduction of maternal mortality. Obstetric patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are an important part of the global burden of maternal morbidity. Social determinants influence health outcomes of pregnant women. Additionally, intimate partner violence has a great negative impact on women's health and pregnancy outcome. However, little is known about the contextual and social aspects of obstetric patients treated in the ICU. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the social determinants and exposure to intimate partner violence of obstetric patients admitted to an ICU. Methods and analysis: A systematic search will be conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, ProQuest, LILACS and SciELO from 2000 to 2016. Studies published in English and Spanish will be identified in relation to data reporting on social determinants of health and/or exposure to intimate partner violence of obstetric women, treated in the ICU during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy. Two reviewers will independently screen for study eligibility and data extraction. Risk of bias and assessment of the quality of the included studies will be performed by using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Data will be analysed and summarised using a narrative description of the available evidence across studies. This systematic review protocol will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.

Whereas the systematic synthesis of published qualitative data is now well established, the synthesis of qualitative data that make up a programme of work is rare. A Programme of Research on Violence in Diverse Domestic Environments (PROVIDE) is a UK NIHR funded programme. The five studies associated with PROVIDE are sited in general practice, sexual health clinics, mental health services and 3rd sector IPV agencies. Synthesising the data from across the studies offered an opportunity to highlight variations in help-seeking strategies according to gender and sexual orientation and identify variations in help-seeking across different contexts. The approach to the synthesis was meta-ethnography. The synthesis identified 23 2nd order constructs in relation to helpseeking. Findings show gender and sexuality influences how help-seeking in different contexts is viewed. Disclosure of IPV to mental health services was rare. Women favour help-seeking from primary care which is familiar and where they are known, whilst gay men favour help-seeking from GUM clinics where there is a taken for granted acknowledgement of sexual identity.

Specialization literature in general, however, holds that specialization is not very common—even in DV. The current study builds on previous work by using multiple analytic methods to assess specialization/versatility among DV offenders, with a focus on gender differences. Methods: The sample includes 730 individuals processed through a misdemeanor DV docket. Demographic measures were available, and complete criminal histories were compiled for each defendant. Analyses include the diversity index and offense specialization coefficient, multivariate models predicting those measures, multilevel item response theory analysis, and latent class analysis (LCA). Results: Results are generally consistent in finding an effect of gender on DV specialization as well as relationships between the age of onset and the overall offending frequency. Female offenders demonstrate a greater degree of DV specialization than male offenders did. However, gender did not distinguish between the DV specialist group and two more versatile groups derived from the LCA.

1206,"© 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.This article explores the ways in which lethal intimate partner violence perpetrated by both men and women is made sense of in news reports in Finnish tabloids. An analytical approach drawing upon critical discursive psychology, complemented with tools from membership categorization analysis, was adopted for distinguishing recurring patterns in accounting for violence and use of gendered categorizations in the news. Two recurring interpretative repertoires of violence were identified. The first constructs violence as originating from interactional or relationship problems, while the second relies upon characterizations of the perpetrators as pathological or deviant to explain violence. The analysis accords particular attention to the ways in which the ideal of gender-neutrality that is prevalent in Finnish society is drawn upon in these repertoires, and how this ideal entwines with the circulation of gender-specific assumptions. The analysis also illustrates how categorizations often work in the reports to preserve the normality of men as perpetrators of lethal intimate partner violence while attaching deviance and moral questionability to women both as victims and as perpetrators, thus maintaining the taken-for-grantedness of gendered differences in relation to violence.",2016-11-01,Journal,Article,Feminism and Psychology,14172,6,26,“She must be an odd kind of woman”: Gendered categorizations in accounts of lethal intimate partner violence in Finnish tabloid news,2,,10.1177/0959353516655370,SAGE Publications Ltdinfo@sagepub.co.uk,,2016.0,53.0,0.0,,1206,114108902,Satu Venäläinen,,,,,,,,,,,22.0,60.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology
1207,"© 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.In recent years a feminist gender discourse of femicide has become established in Italian political debate. Stereotypical and sexist representations of women are singled out as key issues to be addressed in the fight against Violence Against Women (VAW). Gender discourse and associated cultural/linguistic enterprise simplify heterosexual (violent) relational dynamics, overshadow different situational, relational and socio-psychological readings of violence and foreground a cultural understanding of the human being as a self-determined artificially constructed identity. The authors of this article suggest that this discourse on femicide can be read through the lens of Foucault’s theory of biopolitics, as a device of manipulation of human identity. Furthermore the authors borrow from Habermas’s theory of public sphere and argue that the hegemonic gender interpretation of femicide reflects the specific vantage point of feminist groups while it is not the result of any inclusive public reflections on the causes of this social phenomenon. Their core argument is that a gender discourse of femicide contributes to the advancement of a social constructivist paradigm in the interpretation of self in postmodern society, a society that, as warned by sociologist David Riesman and Jungian psychologist Tony Wolff, is populated by individuals that conform to cultural values.",2016-11-01,Journal,Article,Current Sociology,100147030,5,64,‘Femminicidio’ in Italy: A critique of feminist gender discourse and constructivist reading of the human identity,2,,10.1177/0011392115625723,SAGE Publications Ltdinfo@sagepub.co.uk,,2016.0,82.0,0.0,,1207,82607286,Daniela Bandelli,145646627,Giorgio Porcelli,,,,,,,,,29.0,39.0,3.0,14.0,21.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology

1210,"© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.An ongoing discussion in the partner violence (PV) literature exists concerning the respective roles of perpetrator and victim. Most of it is gender based. The classical feminist argument is that women are victims of the violence and this is sustained by the social perception of them as victims. More recently increased recognition of mutual violence has taken place, calling into question the gender-based victim/perpetrator model. Recent research further calls into question this role differentiation through findings indicating that a majority of the protagonists in the PV drama view themselves as victims. A corollary to this controversy is that whether a man or a woman is the victim, the principal client in conventional intervention with PV is the woman. This paper will argue that the relevancy of gender-based role differentiation for most PV cases is not supported by recent data, and that incorporating an interactive perspective enables a more complex view than the classical victim/perpetrator one, and may improve our practice with PV populations.",2016-11-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Family Violence,20369,2,31,The Social Construction of Roles in Intimate Partner Violence: Is the Victim/Perpetrator Model the only Viable one?,0,false,10.1007/s10896-016-9879-y,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,Journal of Family Violence,2016.0,30.0,1.0,,1210,2807975,Z.

Participants (N = 386) were randomly assigned to play a VVG or a NVG prior to presumably interacting with another (non-existent) participant. We then measured participants' aggressive inclinations: Participants reported how many pins they would like to stick into a “voodoo doll” representing their interaction partner, and participants reported how likely they would be to actually harm their interaction partner. We did not detect any differences between conditions for several outcomes: the amount of aggressive inclinations displayed during the interaction, the number of pins participants chose to stick into a representation of their interaction partner, and participants' self-reported likelihood they would harm their interaction partner. Thus, the hypothesis that playing a VVG would increase aggressive inclinations was not supported in this study.

1213,"© 2016, Society for Prevention Research.This longitudinal study tested whether sexual harassment perpetration mediates the relationship between bullying perpetration and teen dating violence (TDV) perpetration and tested moderated mediation by assessing whether the developmental pathway varies by gender among middle school-aged youth. Although TDV has been associated with bullying and sexual harassment, the developmental relationship among all three behaviors has rarely been examined, especially by gender. The data were collected from one cohort of seventh grade middle school students (N = 612) from four schools. Students were surveyed every 6 months during seventh and eighth grades for a total of four waves of data collection. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to address the study aims, consisting of three stages: measurement models, mediation, and moderated mediation (otherwise known as Contrast of Mediated Effects). Results indicate no evidence of mediation. However, in the overall model, bullying and sexual harassment both emerged as significant predictors of TDV at a later time point. Among girls, only bullying significantly predicted TDV at a later time point, and, among boys, only sexual harassment significantly predicted TDV at a later time point.

1215,"© 2016Several explanations have been proposed to explain the origins and the development of rape and sexual aggression against women. For the most part, the first three generations of research and theorizing provided an inherently static view of the propensity among males to commit a sexual aggression, providing little information about the developmental processes involved in the origins and course of sexually aggressive behavior. This article provides a review of contemporary explanations of sexual aggression against women and an examination of the underlying developmental issues that these models imply. Given the emergence of longitudinal research on sexual aggression, these issues are then contrasted and compared with the relatively nascent body of knowledge about the origins and the development of sexual aggression over the life course. More specifically, in recent years a fourth generation of research and theorizing concerned by the developmental and life course factors conducive to rape and sexual aggression has emerged. This fourth generation proposes a more dynamic etiological framework to understand the origins and the development of sexually aggressive behaviors that is directed by men toward women. Emerging research from this generation highlight unresolved issues about, among other things, the understanding of the continuity and discontinuity of rape and sexual aggression over time as well as the developmental pathways leading to rape and sexual aggression.",2016-11-01,Journal,Review,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,20,31,Understanding the origins and the development of rape and sexual aggression against women: Four generations of research and theorizing,2,,10.1016/j.avb.2016.07.008,Elsevier Ltd,,2016.0,183.0,0.0,,1215,5668781,P.

1216,"© 2016 The Author(s)Introduction Little is known about gender differences in aetiology and management of acute burns in resource-constrained settings in South Africa. Method This cross-sectional study is based on burn case reports (n = 1915) from eight emergency centres in Western Cape, South Africa (June 2012–May 2013). Male/female rate ratios by age group and age-specific incidence rates were compiled for urban and rural areas along with gender differences in proportions between children and adults for injury aetiology, burn severity, length of stay and patient disposition. Results Children 0–4 years in urban areas had the highest burn incidence but only among adults did male rates surpass females, with fire burns more common among men 20–39 years and hot liquid burns among men 55+ years. Men had a higher proportion of burns during weekends, from interpersonal violence and suspected use of alcohol/other substances, with more pronounced differences for hot liquid burns. Despite similar Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores, men were more often transferred to higher levels of care and women more often treated and discharged. Conclusion Burns were far more common among children although gender differences arose only among adults. Men sustained more injuries of somewhat different aetiology and were referred to higher levels of care more often for comparable wound severity. The results suggest different disposition between men and women despite similar AIS scores. However, further studies with more comprehensive information on severity level and other care- and patient-related factors are needed to explore these results further.",2016-11-01,Journal,Article,Burns,29574,36,42,"Gender differences in burns: A study from emergency centres in the Western Cape, South Africa",1,true,10.1016/j.burns.2016.05.003,Elsevier Ltd,Burns,2016.0,42.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Burns were far more common among children although gender differences arose only among adults, and the results suggest different disposition between men and women despite similar AIS scores.'}",1216,7235957,Lisa Blom,32295492,A.

1217,"© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Changing and challenging social norms is essential to preventing gendered violence, and education is widely regarded as a key means through which this can happen. Whilst good-quality research exploring the outcomes of such educational interventions exists, very little is known about what actually happens inside educational spaces aiming to instigate change. This gap limits understandings of how and why change does (or does not) happen. This paper aims to address this by providing an opportunity to peer into a ‘space for change’. To do this, observational data are analysed from a non-formal education programme aiming to empower girls to be free from violence in Kenya. Three moments are explored which illustrate ‘empowerment’, ‘subversion’ and ‘resistance’. The paper also explores the often hidden stories of the facilitators, showing that who teaches can be as important as the curriculum used in determining what happens inside educational spaces for change.",2016-11-01,Journal,Article,Sex Education,100147343,3,16,"Peering into ‘spaces for change’: empowerment, subversion and resistance in a gendered violence prevention education programme in Kenya",0,false,10.1080/14681811.2016.1165658,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,,2016.0,51.0,2.0,,1217,1484380222,Mary Cobbett-Ondiek,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,8.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology

1219,"© 2016 The Author(s).Background: Women who engage in sex work are at risk for experiencing violence from numerous perpetrators, including paying partners. Empirical evidence has shown mixed results regarding the impact of participation in microfinance interventions on women's experiences of violence, with some studies demonstrating reductions in intimate partner violence (IPV) and others showing heightened risk for IPV. The current study reports on the impact of participation in a microsavings intervention on experiences of paying partner violence among women engaged in sex work in Mongolia. Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, we conducted a two-arm, non-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing an HIV/STI risk reduction intervention (HIVSRR) (control condition) to a combined microsavings and HIVSRR intervention (treatment condition). Eligible women (aged 18 or older, reported having engaged in unprotected sex with paying partner in past 90 days, expressed interest in microsavings intervention) were invited to participate. One hundred seven were randomized, including 50 in the control and 57 in the treatment condition. Participants completed assessments at baseline, immediate post-test following HIVSRR, and at 3-months and 6-months after completion of the treatment group intervention. Outcomes for the current study include any violence (physical and/or sexual), sexual violence, and physical violence from paying partners in the past 90 days. Results: An intention-to-treat approach was utilized. Linear growth models revealed significant reductions over time in both conditions for any violence (β = −0.867, p < 0.001), physical violence (β = −0.0923, p < 0.001), and sexual violence (β = −1.639, p = 0.001) from paying partners. No significant differences between groups were found for any violence (β = 0.118, p = 0.389), physical violence (β = 0.091, p = 0.792), or sexual violence (β = 0.379, p = 0.114) from paying partners. Conclusions: Microsavings participation did not significantly impact women's risk for paying partner violence. Qualitative research is recommended to understand the cause for reductions in paying partner violence in both study conditions.

1220,"© 2016 Ibabe.A reduction in academic achievement over the course of adolescence has been observed. School failure is characterized by difficulties to teaching school goals. A variety of other behavioral problems are often associated with school failure. Child-to-parent violence has been associated with different school problems. The main objective of current study was to examine the contribution of family variables (parental education level, family cohesion, and positive family discipline) on academic failure and child-to-parent violence of adolescents from a community sample. Moreover, a goal was to explore if academic failure was a valid predictor of child-to-parent violence. To this end, it has been developed a comprehensive statistical model through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Participants were 584 children from eight secondary schools in the Basque Country (Spain) and aged between 12 and 18. Among other scales Conflict Tactics Scale and Family Environment Scale were administrated for measuring child-to-parent violence and family cohesion environment, respectively. The structural model revealed that parental education level is a relevant protective factor against academic failure. Positive family discipline (inductive discipline, supervision, and penalty) show a significant association with child-to-parent violence and academic failure. Disciplinary practices could be more efficient to prevent child-to-parent violence or school failure if children perceive a positive environment in their home. However, these findings could be explained by inverse causality, because some parents respond to child-to-parent violence or academic failure with disciplinary strategies. School failure had indirect effects on child-to-parent violence through family cohesion.

However, the relative influence of child abuse, adolescent violence, peer approval of violence and pro-violence attitudes on later IPV is not well established. Aims: Analyses focus on the prediction of adult IPV from variables measured in childhood and adolescence to establish the unique influence of earlier victimisation and perpetration of violence, as well as other variables grounded in theory and empirical findings. Methods: Data are from a longitudinal study that began in the 1970s with a sample of 457 preschool-aged children who were reassessed as adults. Outcomes of adult IPV victimisation and perpetration types were regressed on predictors of parent-reported child abuse, officially recorded child maltreatment, adolescent victimisation, violence perpetration, pro-violence attitudes and peer approval of violence during adolescence, controlling for childhood Socio Economic Status (SES), age in adolescence and gender. Results: Dating violence victimisation and peer approval of dating violence in adolescence emerged as the unique predictors of IPV victimisation and perpetration in adulthood.

Three qualitative data sets were analyzed using grounded theory methodology. From this secondary analysis, emerged categories and concepts that illustrate the ways couples demonstrate nonviolence principles in these relationships. The first main category was awareness, which included accountability, reflection, commitment, and justice.

This study examined the role of syndemic conditions and social gender affirmation processes (living full-time in one’s identified gender) in potentiating sexual risk among TMSM adults in Massachusetts, US. Cross-sectional data were restricted to TMSM who reported lifetime sexual behaviour with a cisgender male (n = 173; mean age = 29.4, SD = 9.6; 18.5% people of colour; 93.1% non-heterosexual identity; 56.1% hormones/surgery). Sexual risk outcomes were: lifetime STI diagnoses, three or more sexual partners in the previous six months, and condomless anal/vaginal sex at last encounter with a cisgender male. Age- and survey mode-adjusted logistic regression models regressed sexual risk outcomes on the main effect of syndemics (six indicators summed: binge drinking, substance use, depression, anxiety, childhood abuse, intimate partner violence), followed by the interaction of syndemics and social gender affirmation. Syndemics were associated with increased odds of all sexual risk indicators (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] = 1.32–1.55; p < 0.0001).

1227,"© 2016 The Royal Society for Public HealthObjectives This work explores the association between socio-economic position (SEP) and intimate partner violence (IPV) considering the perspectives of men and women as victims, perpetrators and as both (bidirectional). Study design Cross-sectional international multicentre study. Methods A sample of 3496 men and women, (aged 18–64 years), randomly selected from the general population of residents from six European cities was assessed: Athens; Budapest; London; Östersund; Porto; and Stuttgart. Their education (primary, secondary and university), occupation (upper white collar, lower white collar and blue collar) and unemployment duration (never, ≤12 months and >12 months) were considered as SEP indicators and physical IPV was measured with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales. Results Past year physical IPV was declared by 17.7% of women (3.5% victims, 4.2% perpetrators and 10.0% bidirectional) and 19.8% of men (4.1% victims, 3.8% perpetrators and 11.9% bidirectional). Low educational level (primary vs university) was associated with female victimisation (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 3.2; 1.3–8.0) and with female bidirectional IPV (4.1, 2.4–7.1). Blue collar occupation (vs upper white) was associated with female victimisation (2.1, 1.1–4.0), female perpetration (3.0, 1.3–6.8) and female bidirectional IPV (4.0, 2.3–7.0). Unemployment duration was associated with male perpetration (>12 months of unemployment vs never unemployed: 3.8; 1.7–8.7) and with bidirectional IPV in both sex (women: 1.8, 1.2–2.7; men: 1.7, 1.0–2.8).

1228,"© 2016 The AuthorsBackground Studies have shown rates of IPV-perpetration among men in substance misuse treatment at rates far higher than the general population. There is poor evidence for the effectiveness of IPV perpetrator programmes. Methods An analysis of drugs and alcohol policy documents 1998–2015 was conducted using discourse analysis to examine how English drug and alcohol policy has addressed IPV among substance misusers. Transcripts of interviews with 20 stake holders were analysed thematically. Results How policy ‘frames’ IPV-perpetration among drug and alcohol misusers has implications for service provision. IPV has increasingly been framed in terms of its implications for child safeguarding, and has been ‘folded in’ to policies targeting Troubled Families. With increasing ‘localism’ in English drug and alcohol policy there has been little specification of services for substance misusing IPV-perpetrators. Policy and literature produced by IPV perpetrator and victim organisations has framed IPV-perpetration as an individual choice with intoxication as a post hoc excuse for violence with limited implications for effective service development. Interviews with stake holders indicate a range of understandings/explanations for IPV among substance misusing men. Stake holders suggest that not all staff have the confidence or skills to ask men about their relationships and that there are few referral routes for substance misusing men who seek help for their IPV perpetration. Conclusion There are gaps and contradictions in the extent to which English drug and alcohol policy has sought to address IPV-perpetration among substance misusers.

1229,"© 2016 American Psychological Association.Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a substantial public health problem. Psychopathic personality is one of the most important individual difference predictors of violence and has been proposed as a key feature for understanding IPV perpetration. Psychopathy is also associated with alcohol use, a prominent risk factor for IPV. This pattern of interrelationship raises the possibility that psychopathy might mediate the relationship between alcohol use and IPV. However, few studies have examined the combined influences of alcohol use and psychopathy on aggressive behavior, and, to our knowledge, no study has directly examined these interrelationships in the context of IPV. In the present study, we aim to enhance our understanding of risk for IPV perpetration by examining the consistency of the association between psychopathy and violence across levels of alcohol use and gender in 2 samples: A prospective clinical sample (n = 703) and a cross-sectional sample of university students (n = 870). Psychopathy was associated with IPV across both samples independently and, after controlling for gender and alcohol use (R2 =-04-.08), also mediated the relationship between alcohol use and IPV among the nonclinical sample. We found that psychopathy was associated with IPV, that this relationship was consistent despite gender and alcohol use, and was evident across samples. This relationship was small but robust, and appeared to be more prominent than the association between alcohol use and IPV.

1234,"© 2016 Elsevier LtdBackground The conceptualisation of transgender identity as a mental disorder has contributed to precarious legal status, human rights violations, and barriers to appropriate health care among transgender people. The proposed reconceptualisation of categories related to transgender identity in WHO's forthcoming International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 removes categories related to transgender identity from the classification of mental disorders, in part based on the idea that these conditions do not satisfy the definitional requirements of mental disorders. We aimed to determine whether distress and impairment, considered essential characteristics of mental disorders, could be explained by experiences of social rejection and violence rather than being inherent features of transgender identity, and to examine the applicability of other elements of the proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. Methods This field study used a retrospective interview design in a purposive sample of transgender adults (aged >18 years or older) receiving health-care services at the Condesa Specialised Clinic in Mexico City, Mexico. Participants completed a detailed structured interview focusing on sociodemographic characteristics, medical history related to gender identity, and, during a specific period of adolescence, key concepts related to gender identity diagnoses as proposed for ICD-11 and from DSM-5 and ICD-10, psychological distress, functional impairment, social rejection, and violence. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and univariate comparisons and multivariate logistic regression models predicting distress and dysfunction. Findings Between April 1, 2014, and Aug 17, 2014, 260 transgender adults were approached and 250 were enrolled in the study and completed the interview. Most (n=202 [81%]) had been assigned a male sex at birth. Participants reported first awareness of transgender identity at a mean age of 5·6 years (SD 2·5, range 2–17), and 184 (74%) had used health interventions for body transformation, most commonly hormones (182 [73%)], with the first such intervention at a mean age of 25·0 years (SD 9·1, range 10–54). 84 (46%) of those who had used hormones did so initially without medical supervision. During adolescence, distress related to gender identity was very common, but not universal (n=208 [83%]), and average level of distress was quite high among those who reported it (79·9 on a scale of 0 [none at all] to 100 [extreme], SD 20·7, range 20–100). Most participants (n=226 [90%] reported experiencing family, social, or work or scholastic dysfunction related to their gender identity, but this was typically moderate (on a scale of 0 [not at all disrupted] to 10 [extremely disrupted], family dysfunction mean 5·3 [SD 3·9, range 0–10]; social dysfunction mean 5·0 [SD 3·8, range 0–10]; work or scholastic dysfunction mean 4·8 [SD 3·6, range 0–10]). Multivariate logistic regression models indicated that distress and all types of dysfunction were strongly predicted by experiences of social rejection (odds ratios [ORs] 2·29–8·15) and violence (1·99–3·99). A current male gender identity also predicted distress (OR 3·90). Of the indicators of gender incongruence, only asking to be treated as a different gender was a significant predictor, and only of work or scholastic dysfunction (OR 1·82). Interpretation This study provides additional support for classifying health-related categories related to transgender identity outside the classification of mental disorders in the ICD-11. The reconceptualisation and related reclassification of transgender-related health conditions in the ICD-11 could serve as a useful instrument in the discussion of public health policies aimed at increasing access to appropriate services and reducing the victimisation of transgender people.

1235,"© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.ABSTRACT: Globally intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem that can be perpetrated by both males and females, although males are more likely to inflict severe IPV-related injuries on their female partners. In low- and middle-income countries like South Africa, few studies have conducted research to determine whether IPV perpetration by men may be a risk factor for engaging in other risk behaviours. The aim of this study is to determine whether IPV perpetration by men is a risk factor for engaging in other risk behaviours with a particular focus on risky sexual behaviours and alcohol misuse. The data for this study were drawn from a multilevel intervention study, which addressed the nexus of alcohol abuse and HIV prevention among men in South Africa. Men were screened and recruited from informal drinking places within 12 communities situated in one of the oldest, predominantly Xhosa-speaking African townships in Cape Town. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyse the associations between IVP and potential explanatory variables. Of the 975 men included in the survey, 39.9% reported to have been involved in Intimate Partner Violence. IPV perpetration was significantly more likely among men who reported having a child [OR 1.51 (1.07–2.14) p =.019], having a casual sexual partner [OR 1.51 (1.11–2.05) p =.008], and those with possible alcohol dependence [OR 3.46 (1.17–10.20) p =.024]. IPV was significantly less likely among men with matric educational qualification than those with no education [OR 0.30 (95% CI: 0.09–1.02) p =.053] and among those who reported using a condom at last sex [OR 0.69 (0.50–0.97) p =.034].

1236,"© 2016 The Author(s).Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a significant global public health problem, which is associated with negative psychosocial outcomes and high-risk sexual behaviors in adults. Men who have sex with men (MSM) often report higher prevalence of CSA history than the general population, and CSA may play a key role in MSM's greater vulnerability to HIV. Methods: This study examined the prevalence of CSA history and its impact on the number of recent HIV-related risk behaviors (unprotected anal intercourse, high number of male and female sexual partners, alcohol use, drug use, and sex work in prior 6 months) and lifetime risk behaviors and experiences (high number of lifetime male and female sexual partners, early sexual debut, injection drug use, sex work, and intimate partner violence) among 11,788 adult MSM recruited via respondent driven sampling across 12 sites in India, with additional insights from thematic analysis of qualitative research with 363 MSM from 15 sites. Results: Nearly a quarter (22.4 %) of participants experienced CSA, with substantially higher prevalence of CSA in the South and among kothis (feminine sexual identity). Qualitative findings revealed that older, trusted men may target young and, especially, gender nonconforming boys, and perpetrators' social position facilitates nondisclosure. CSA may also initiate further same-sex encounters, including sex work. In multivariable analysis, MSM who experienced CSA had 21 % higher rate of recent (adjusted rate ratio [aRR = 1.21], 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.28), and 2.0 times higher lifetime (aRR = 2.04, 95 % CI: 1.75-2.38) HIV-related behaviors/experiences compared with those who did not. Conclusion: This large, mixed-methods study found high overall prevalence of CSA among MSM (22.4 %), with substantially higher prevalence among MSM residing in the South and among more feminine sexual identities. Qualitative findings highlighted boys' vulnerabilities to CSA, especially gender nonconformity, and CSA's role in further sexual encounters, including sex work. Additionally, CSA was associated with an elevated rate of recent, and an even higher rate of lifetime HIV-related risk factors.

1237,"© 2016 Taylor & Francis.Gay panic refers to a situation in which a heterosexual individual loses control and commits a violent crime against a gay individual when faced with unwanted sexual advances. In court, it is argued the defendant was provoked, defending himself from possible gay rape, or even became temporarily unable to distinguish right from wrong. Despite use in many trials across the country, with varying degrees of success, the conceptualization has little merit based upon its psychological roots. Rather, the strategy appears to rely primarily upon antigay stereotypes. Counteracting gay victimization is the emergence of hate crime laws, enhancing punishments for offenders who unfairly target this group of individuals.

1238,"Introduction: The rights of trans people are protected by a range of international and regional mechanisms. Yet, punitive national laws, policies and practices targeting transgender people, including complex procedures for changing identification documents, strip transgender people of their rights and limit access to justice. This results in gross violations of human rights on the part of state perpetrators and society at large. Transgender people's experience globally is that of extreme social exclusion that translates into increased vulnerability to HIV, other diseases, including mental health conditions, limited access to education and employment, and loss of opportunities for economic and social advancement. In addition, hatred and aggression towards a group of individuals who do not conform to social norms around gender manifest in frequent episodes of extreme violence towards transgender people. This violence often goes unpunished. Discussion: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) views its work in the area of HIV through the lens of human rights and advances a range of development solutions such as poverty reduction, improved governance, active citizenship, and access to justice. This work directly relates to advancing the rights of transgender people. This manuscript lays out the various aspects of health, human rights, and development that frame transgender people's issues and outlines best practice solutions from transgender communities and governments around the globe on how to address these complex concerns. The examples provided in the manuscript can help guide UN agencies, governments, and transgender activists in achieving better standards of health, access to justice, and social inclusion for transgender communities everywhere. Conclusions: The manuscript provides a call to action for countries to urgently address the violations of human rights of transgender people in order to honour international obligations, stem HIV epidemics, promote gender equality, strengthen social and economic development, and put a stop to untrammelled violence.",2016-07-17,Journal,Review,Journal of the International AIDS Society,19700175037,35,19,Transgender social inclusion and equality: A pivotal path to development,1,true,10.7448/IAS.19.3.20803,International AIDS Societyeditorial@jiasociety.org,Journal of the International AIDS Society,2016.0,47.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""Transgender people's experience globally is that of extreme social exclusion that translates into increased vulnerability to HIV, other diseases, including mental health conditions, limited access to education and employment, and loss of opportunities for economic and social advancement.""}",1238,48657075,V.

1239,"© 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Known for graphic gore and formal experimentation, films of European new extremism stand out for the way in which they combine sex with violence, stressing the body in extreme modes of being and rendering its materiality emphatic, uncanny and profoundly disturbing. While this emphasis on sex and violence has been widely recognized in scholarly literature on new extremism, its connections to gendered conventions of genre cinema have not. In this article, we contend that films such as Philippe Grandrieux's Sombre (1998), Lars von Trier's Antichrist (2009) and Claire Denis's Trouble Every Day (2001) directly reference gendered tropes and conventions of horror cinema in their explorations of desire, sexual difference and violence. Far from being inconsequential or secondary concerns, we argue that emphatically gendered characteristics of cinematic horror are crucial to the disturbing impact of these films.

1240,"© 2016 University of the Witwatersrand.This article offers a feminist literary analysis of Angela Makholwa’s two crime novels, Red Ink (2007) and Black Widow Society (2013), in order to explore how a black female author represents gendered constructions of identity and gender violence in the genre of crime fiction. Over the last few decades, crime fiction has received increased scholarly attention in academic circles, both locally and abroad. In the South African context, scholars have tended to focus their analytical gaze on a few, well-known and established crime writers. I seek to extend the critical debate about South African crime writing by turning my attention to the work of a black female crime writer. Although Makholwa’s novels make a number of observations about the salience of race in the South African milieu, this analysis focuses on her fictional representations of contemporary gender assumptions and relations. In particular, I consider how her literary representations of gender violence invite readers to trace the violence back to the gendered ordering of female characters’ lived experiences. A close reading of her novels reveals that misogyny is rife and that, regardless of where they are located on the socio-economic ladder, female characters must negotiate their way in terms of very prescriptive and fundamentally gendered scripts. Rather than regarding violence against women as aberrations, these texts suggest that such violence is pervasive and that the brutal instances of physical violence are merely extreme manifestations of discursive and structural gender oppression that shapes every aspect of the female characters’ lives. This article follows an interdisciplinary approach and I utilise founding and contemporary gender theory as well as sociological gender research to enrich the literary analysis of Makholwa’s texts.",2016-07-02,Journal,Article,English Studies in Africa,5700156985,6,59,Constructions of Gender in Contemporary South African Crime Fiction: A Feminist Literary Analysis of the Novels of Angela Makholwa,0,false,10.1080/00138398.2016.1239415,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,,2016.0,40.0,0.0,,1240,144107030,J.

As for this, 121 participants, ranging from 18 to 66 years old (M=37,08), read a vignette of intimidate partner violence (subtle or overt) which should assess in the degree of observed violence. Moreover, participants were assessed in ambivalent sexism, conflict resolution tactics, adult attachment, perceived victimization, and objective experience measure of intimate partner violence. Results showed that the vignettes of overt violence were evaluated as more representative of gender violence than the subtle ones. Males, in comparison with females, assessed that subtle violence has a greater influence on victim behavior, and that the overt violence on access of victims to the partner claims. Meanwhile, females reported that overt violence has more influence on victim behavior, and that the subtle violence on facilitating the victim access to the partner claims. Results also confirm the low detection rate of the subtle violence as constitutive of gender violence.

Modern research shows much higher numbers of transgender people than were apparent in earlier clinic-based studies, as well as biological factors associated with gender incongruence. We examine research showing that many transgender people live on the margins of society, facing stigma, discrimination, exclusion, violence, and poor health. They often experience difficulties accessing appropriate health care, whether specific to their gender needs or more general in nature. Some governments are taking steps to address human rights issues and provide better legal protection for transgender people, but this action is by no means universal. The mental illness perspective that currently frames health-care provision for transgender people across much of the world is under scrutiny.

The theoretical implication is that, like other forms of partner abuse, understanding IT can be enhanced when it is conceptualized as a characteristic of couples, not just of individuals. A critique of Johnson's criteria to identify IT concludes it is inadequate to identify cases which correspond to what is implied by “terrorism.” The research and clinical implication are that if the concept of IT is used, the data analysis or treatment plan can benefit from by identifying the cases as Male-Only, Female-Only, or Both IT.",2016-07-01,Journal,Review,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,9,29,Concordance between partners in “intimate terrorism”: A comparison of two typologies,0,false,10.1016/j.avb.2016.06.003,Elsevier Ltd,,2016.0,51.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Analysis of ""Intimate Terrorism"" in relationships of 14,252 university student couples finds that, like other forms of partner abuse, understanding IT can be enhanced when it is conceptualized as a characteristic of couples, not just of individuals.'}",1243,3178055,M.

1247,"© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Violence is a topic of great social relevance, frequently causing tremendous health consequences for those affected and high consequential costs for health care and the national economy. The established consulting and assistance services are usually restricted to offers for ambulant supply, mainly from private agencies or societies. As a result, there is no identification and care for patients who have experienced violence and who are treated in hospital. Another deficiency is the identification and care of male victims of violence. Despite wide-ranging offers of assistance, only very few gender-specific consulting and support services have been available to date. Therefore, the model project “Gender Gewaltkonzept” was initiated at Aachen University Hospital to assess the prevalence of violence and the potential consequences of the violence experienced on the patients’ health. In addition, we investigated whether males and females are in need of different supply requirements. Based on the results of the project “Gender Gewaltkonzept” so far, and on prevalence estimates proving that there is a high rate of violent experiences in both males and females, this overview is aimed at presenting the aid and protection concepts available for victims of violence, in addition to the existing deficiencies of the care system.

1248,"© 2016 The Author(s).Background: The presence of alcohol or other substances of abuse in blood or urine from injured patients is often used as a proxy for substance influence at the time of injury. The aim of this study was to obtain an estimate of substance influence at the time of injury based on blood concentrations of alcohol and other substances of abuse, and to explore the relationship between the substance prevalence at the time of admittance to the hospital and the actual influence at the time of the injury. Methods: The study included all adult patients admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital during 1 year (n=996). Quantification in blood was done by an enzymatic method for alcohol, and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for 28 other substances of abuse. Concentrations of alcohol and other substances in blood at the time of injury were calculated. The degree of influence was assessed on the basis of the calculated blood concentrations, with a threshold of influence set at a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05%, or a substance concentration leading to an influence similar to that of a BAC of 0.05%. Results: A total of 324 patients (32.5%) were determined to be under the influence at the time of injury. In comparison, 394 patients (39.6%) had one or more substances above the cut-off limit in blood at the time of admittance to the hospital. Alcohol was the most prevalent substance causing influence at 25.9%. Among patients with violence-related injuries, almost 75% were under the influence of alcohol and/or substances. Patients under the influence were younger, and men were more often under the influence than women. More patients were under the influence at nighttime and during weekends than at daytime and on weekdays. Conclusions: About one third of the injured patients were determined to be under the influence at the time of injury, with alcohol being the most prevalent substance causing influence.

Gender, agespecific and regional trends in violence-related injury in England and Wales since 2010 have not been studied. Methods Data on violence-related injury were collected from a structured sample of 151 EDs in England and Wales. ED attendance date and age and gender of patients who reported injury in violence from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014 were identified from attendance codes, specified at the local level.

1254,"© 2016 The Author(s).Background: Women affected by adversity, including gender-based violence, are at increased risk for developing common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed Problem Management Plus (PM+), a 5-session, individual psychological intervention program, that can be delivered by non-specialist counsellors that addresses common mental disorders in people affected by adversity. The objectives of this study are to evaluate effectiveness of PM+ among women who have been affected by adversity, including gender-based violence, and to perform a process evaluation. Methods: Informed by community consultations, the PM+ manual has been translated and adapted to the local context. A randomized controlled trial will be carried out in the catchment areas of three local health care facilities in Dagoretti Sub County, Nairobi. After informed consent, females with high psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12 (score >2) and functional impairment (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 score >16) will be randomised to PM+ (n = 247) or enhanced treatment as usual (n = 247). Post-treatment and 3-months post-treatment follow-up assessments include psychological distress, functional disability, PTSD symptoms, perceived problems for which the person seeks help, health care use and health costs. For evaluating the process of implementing PM+ within local communities in Nairobi 20 key informant interviews will be carried out in participants, PM+ providers, decision makers, clinical staff. Discussion: If PM+ is proven effective, it will be rolled out to other low and middle income areas and other populations for further adaptation and testing.

1255,"© 2016 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Gender is an important factor in child development. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, girls have often been shown to be less likely to access education compared to boys. The consequence of this has been that that programmes addressing child development are often aimed at girls in order to redress gender imbalances. This study examines the effect of gender on the development of children attending community-based organisations in high HIV-affected areas, and explores whether community-based organisation attendance was associated with any changes in gender differences over time. Baseline data from 989 children and 12–15 month follow from 854 (86% response rate) were used to examine gender differences in children from Malawi and South Africa. At baseline, where there were differences by gender, these tended to disadvantage boys. It was found that boys were significantly more often found to be subjected to violence. Boys showed worse performance at school and more behavioural problems than girls. These gender differences persisted from baseline to follow-up. At follow-up, boys self-reported significantly worse average quality of life than girls. Only harsh discipline differed by gender in progression over time: boys experienced a stronger reduction in harsh physical discipline than girls from baseline to follow-up. Since harsh discipline was associated with boys’ worse educational outcomes and behavioural problems, our data cautiously suggests that gender differences could be reduced over time. In conclusion, our data suggests that, perhaps due to the narrow equity approach focusing on provision for girls, boys may be overlooked. As a result, there are some specific experiences where boys are generally worse off. These differences have distinct ramifications for the educational and emotional development of boys. A broader equity approach to child development might be warranted to ensure that the needs of both girls and boys are considered, and that boys are not overlooked.",2016-05-26,Journal,Article,AIDS Care - Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV,21321,9,28,"Do not forget the boys – gender differences in children living in high HIV-affected communities in South Africa and Malawi in a longitudinal, community-based study",1,true,10.1080/09540121.2016.1176680,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,AIDS Care,2016.0,57.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The data suggests that, perhaps due to the narrow equity approach focusing on provision for girls, boys may be overlooked and a broader equity approach to child development might be warranted to ensure that the needs of both girls and boys are considered, and that boys are not overlooked.'}",1255,3904163,I.

1256,"© 2016 Elsevier Inc.Intersex people and bodies have been considered incapable of integration into society. Medical interventions on often healthy bodies remain the norm, addressing perceived familial and cultural demands, despite concerns about necessity, outcomes, conduct and consent. A global and decentralised intersex movement pursues simple core goals: the rights to bodily autonomy and self-determination, and an end to stigmatisation. The international human rights system is responding with an array of new policy statements from human rights institutions and a handful of national governments recognising the rights of intersex people. However, major challenges remain to implement those statements. Human rights violations of intersex individuals persist, deeply embedded in a deliberate history of silencing. Rhetoric of change to clinical practices remain unsubstantiated. Policy disjunctions arise in a framing of intersex issues as matters of sexual orientation and gender identity, rather than innate sex characteristics; this has led to a rhetoric of inclusion that is not matched by the reality.

1257,"© 2016There are an estimated 7 million burn injuries in India annually, of which 700,000 require hospital admission and 140,000 are fatal. According to the National Burns Programme, 91,000 of these deaths are women; a figure higher than that for maternal mortality. Women of child bearing age are on average three times more likely than men to die of burn injuries. This paper reviews the existing literature on burn injuries in India and raises pertinent issues about prevalence, causes and gaps in recognising the gendered factors leading to a high number of women dying due to burns. The work of various women's groups and health researchers with burns victims raises several questions about the categorisation of burn deaths as accident, suicide and homicide and the failure of the health system to recognise underlying violence. Despite compelling evidence, the health system has not recognised this as a priority. Considering the substantial cost of burns care, prevention is the key which requires health systems to recognise the linkages between burn injuries and domestic violence. Health systems need to integrate awareness programmes about domestic violence and train health professionals to identify signs and symptoms of violence.

This paper seeks to extend understanding of drivers of single and multiple perpetrator rape (referred to here as SPR and MPR respectively) and the relationships between socio-economic status, childhood trauma, peer pressure, other masculine behaviours and rape. Method 1370 young men aged 15 to 26 were interviewed as part of the randomised controlled trial evaluation of Stepping Stones in the rural Eastern Cape. We used multinomial to compare the characteristics of men who reported rape perpetration at baseline. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine pathways to rape perpetration. Results 76.1% of young men had never raped, 10.0% had perpetrated SPR and 13.9% MPR. The factors associated with both MPR and SPR (compared to never having raped) were indicators of socio-economic status (SES), childhood trauma, sexual coercion by a woman, drug and alcohol use, peer pressure susceptibility, having had transactional sex, multiple sexual partners and being physically violent towards a partner. The SEM showed the relationship between SES and rape perpetration to be mediated by gender inequitable masculinity. It was complex as there was a direct path indicating that SES correlated with the masculinity variable directly such that men of higher SES had more gender inequitable masculinities, and indirect path mediated by peer pressure resistance indicated that the former pertained so long as men lacked peer pressure resistance. Having a higher SES conveyed greater resistance for some men. There was also a path mediated through childhood trauma, such that men of lower SES were more likely to have a higher childhood trauma exposure and this correlated with a higher likelihood of having the gender inequitable masculinity (with or without the mediating effect of peer pressure resistance). Discussion Both higher and lower socio-economic status were associated with raping. Prevention of rape perpetration must focus on changing men's gender ideals, entitlements and inequitable practices. Reducing poverty and adverse childhood experiences should also be of benefit.",2016-05-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,26,11,"Understanding the relationships between gender inequitable behaviours, childhood trauma and socio-economic status in single and multiple perpetrator rape in rural South Africa: Structural equation modelling",1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0154903,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,PLoS ONE,2016.0,29.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Both higher and lower socio-economic status were associated with raping, and the relationship between SES and rape perpetration was shown to be mediated by gender inequitable masculinity.'}",1259,145486556,R.

The integration of educated, trained, regulated and licensed midwives into the health system is associated with improved quality of care and sustained decreases in maternal and newborn mortality. To date, research on barriers to quality of care for women and newborns has not given due attention to the care provider's perspective. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the findings of a systematic mapping of the literature of the social, economic and professional barriers preventing midwifery personnel in low and middle income countries (LMICs) from providing quality of care. Methods and Findings: A systematic search of five electronic databases for literature published between January 1990 and August 2013. Eligible items included published and unpublished items in all languages. Items were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielding 82 items from 34 countries. 44% discussed countries or regions in Africa, 38% in Asia, and 5% in the Americas. Nearly half the articles were published since 2011. Data was extracted and presented in a narrative synthesis and tables. Items were organized into three categories; social; economic and professional barriers, based on an analytical framework. Barriers connected to the socially and culturally constructed context of childbirth, although least reported, appear instrumental in preventing quality midwifery care. Conclusions: Significant social and cultural, economic and professional barriers can prevent the provision of quality midwifery care in LMICs. An analytical framework is proposed to show how the overlaps between the barriers reinforce each other, and that they arise from gender inequality. Links are made between burn out and moral distress, caused by the barriers, and poor quality care. Ongoing mechanisms to improve quality care will need to address the barriers from the midwifery provider perspective, as well as the underlying gender inequality.",2016-05-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,136,11,What prevents quality midwifery care?

According to GST, strain tends to generate negative emotions, which create pressures for corrective action, such as crime and delinquency. Although GST has received strong empirical support, one under-addressed issue is the lack of diversity in sampling population in assessing the generalizability of the theory. Using survey data collected from 335 incarcerated women in four Chinese prisons, this study examined the impact of strain and negative emotions on the level of female criminality. The strain variable, physical abuse, and discrimination, exerted a positive effect on female inmates' levels of criminality, whereas negative emotions were not significantly related to female criminality.

1264,"© 2016 Wirtz et al.Background: Conflict affected refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) are at increased vulnerability to gender-based violence (GBV). Health, psychosocial, and protection services have been implemented in humanitarian settings, but GBV remains under-reported and available services under-utilized. To improve access to existing GBV services and facilitate reporting, the ASIST-GBV screening tool was developed and tested for use in humanitarian settings. This process was completed in four phases: 1) systematic literature review, 2) qualitative research that included individual interviews and focus groups with GBV survivors and service providers, respectively, 3) pilot testing of the developed screening tool, and 4) 3-month implementation testing of the screening tool. Research was conducted among female refugees, aged ≥15 years in Ethiopia, and female IDPs, aged ≥18 years in Colombia. Results: The systematic review and meta-analysis identified a range of GBV experiences and estimated a 21.4 % prevalence of sexual violence (95 % CI:14.9-28.7) among conflict-affected populations. No existing screening tools for GBV in humanitarian settings were identified. Qualitative research with GBV survivors in Ethiopia and Colombia found multiple forms of GBV experienced by refugees and IDPs that occurred during conflict, in transit, and in displaced settings. Identified forms of violence were combined into seven key items on the screening tool: threats of violence, physical violence, forced sex, sexual exploitation, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, and early or forced marriage. Cognitive testing further refined the tool. Pilot testing in both sites demonstrated preliminary feasibility where 64.8 % of participants in Ethiopia and 44.9 % of participants in Colombia were identified with recent (last 12 months) cases of GBV. Implementation testing of the screening tool, conducted as a routine service in camp/district hospitals, allowed for identification of GBV cases and referrals to services. In this phase, 50.6 % of participants in Ethiopia and 63.4 % in Colombia screened positive for recent experiences of GBV. Psychometric testing demonstrated appropriate internal consistency of the tool (Cronbach's α = 0.77) and item response theory demonstrated appropriate discrimination and difficulty of the tool.

1266,"© 2016 Rouhani et al.Background: Sexual violence is prevalent in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and has resulted in sexual violence-related pregnancies (SVRPs). Despite restrictive laws, women may seek to terminate SVRPs; however, there are limited data on termination of SVRPs. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted in 2012 in Bukavu, DRC. Adult women who self-reported an SVRP and termination of that SVRP were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Trained female interviewers verbally administered a quantitative survey to all participants and a semi-structured qualitative survey to a subset. Quantitative data on characteristics and complications of pregnancy termination, including mental health outcomes, were analyzed using SAS. Results: In total, 86 women completed quantitative surveys. Most SVRPs (93 %) involved two or more assailants; 73 % occurred while in captivity. Most women (82 %) terminated the SVRPs at 3 months gestation or earlier; 79 % reported one attempt at pregnancy termination and 21 % more than one attempt. The most common methods of termination were an oral medicine (55 %) or herb (35 %); cimpokolo (31 %) and quinine (18 %) were most frequently reported. These methods were accessed through friends (37 %), healthcare providers (18 %), family (16 %), or self-obtained (12 %). Following the termination, 79 % of women reported subsequent physical symptoms, including abdominal pain (74 %), bleeding (47 %), vaginal discharge (35 %) and fever (18 %); 44 % sought medical care for their symptoms. Varied emotional responses to the termination were reported and included relief (34 %), anxiety (21 %), anger (19 %), guilt (19 %), and regret (10 %). At the time of the study, many women met symptom criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (57 %), depression (50 %), and generalized anxiety disorder (33 %). Conclusion: Most women terminated SVRPs using medications or herbs not recognized as evidence-based methods of pregnancy termination and sought these methods outside of the formal healthcare sector. These data suggest that access to safe abortion methods is needed for women with SVRPs in DRC. Physical symptoms and emotional reactions related to the termination varied.

1270,"© 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.The current review provides an overview of socioepidemiological research in Germany about the prevalence of addictive behaviours (smoking, binge and hazardous drinking, consumption of cannabis and other illegal drugs, the non-medical use of prescription drugs and problematic gambling) among adolescents (11-17 years) and young adults (18-25 years), also differentiating between different socioeconomic status (SES) indicators (attended school type, family affluence, parental occupational status, parental SES, employment status) and migration background. The authors evaluated data from ten national surveys and one regional survey conducted between 2002 and 2012, which included different samples. The trends over this time frame reveal that the proportion of adolescents who smoke tobacco, show problematic patterns of alcohol consumption, use cannabis or other illegal drugs has generally declined over the investigated time span in Germany. The results nevertheless suggest that some strong associations still exist between social inequalities and the prevalence of substance use. The detailed results are summarised in twelve tables. The main results are as follows: 1) Low SES (school type, employment status) was consistently associated with more cigarette smoking, and, where such data was available, this pattern was observed in both males and females. 2) With regard to family affluence, two surveys show that boys with low and middle FAS are significantly less likely to have binge drinking experience compared to boys with high FAS. There were no significant associations between problematic alcohol use and parental SES, and not all results of the surveys show that binge drinking is more prevalent among HS-students. Employment status was associated with gender differences; problematic patterns of alcohol consumption were significantly more prevalent among young unemployed males compared to GY-students (secondary high school/grammar school) of the same age. The opposite was true for females. Another consistent finding was that among adolescents and young adults with a Turkish/Asian migration background, a problematic use of alcohol was significantly less common compared to adolescents and young adults of the same age without a migration background. 3) In terms of the consumption of cannabis, the unemployed and students with low educational level (‘Hauptschule’) emerge as high-risk groups. 4) The results concerning problematic gambling significantly overlap with and reflect the findings of international research: being male, of low educational attainment, unemployed, receiving social welfare, and having a migration background significantly increased the risk of problematic gambling habits. 5) The highest lifetime prevalence rates for the consumption of illegal drugs (other than cannabis) were observed among students with low educational level. It should be noted that other SES indicators, in addition to school type, have not been examined to date. The review concludes by outlining gaps and future research areas, as well as presenting several implications for prevention initiatives.",2016-04-01,Journal,Review,Current Drug Abuse Reviews,18400156715,20,9,Social inequality and substance use and problematic gambling among adolescents and young adults: A review of epidemiological surveys in Germany,0,false,10.2174/1874473709666151209114023,Bentham Science Publishers B.V.P.O.

This study investigates how exposure to sexist video games can decrease empathy for female violence victims.We hypothesized that playing violent-sexist video games would increase endorsement of masculine beliefs, especially among participants who highly identify with dominant and aggressive male game characters. We also hypothesized that the endorsement of masculine beliefs would reduce empathy toward female violence victims. Participants (N = 154) were randomly assigned to play a violentsexist game, a violent-only game, or a non-violent game. After gameplay, measures of identification with the game character, traditional masculine beliefs, and empathy for female violence victims were assessed. We found that participants' gender and their identification with the violent male video game character moderated the effects of the exposure to sexist-violent video games on masculine beliefs. Our results supported the prediction that playing violent- sexist video games increases masculine beliefs, which occurred for male (but not female) participants who were highly identified with the game character. Masculine beliefs, in turn, negatively predicted empathic feelings for female violence victims.

1272,"© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Accessible summary: What is known on the subject?: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has a significant impact on the onset, duration and recurrence of mental health problems. Prevalence rates of IPV are significantly higher in mental health services, but the studies are limited. Accurate assessment of IPV is important for decision making in risk assessment and safety planning within mental health nursing. Psychometrically tested tools are the most accurate way to identifying all areas of IPV abuse: physical, sexual and psychological. What this paper adds to existing knowledge?: Ten IPV screening tools were identified in healthcare and three tools; Women Abuse Screen Tool (WAST), Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS) and Humiliation, Afraid, Rape and Kick (HARK) were identified as having strong psychometric values as they assessed all areas of IPV and were validated against an appropriate reference standard. None of the three IPV tools identified (WAST, AAS, HARK) were tested on men or in mental health settings impacting the gender sensitivities of the tools and the reliability of the prevalence rates of IPV in mental healthcare. Over seventy percent of the studies reviewed were conducted in America this impacts the cultural sensitivities of the IPV tools. What are the implications for practice?: IPV screening needs to be incorporated as a priority in mental health services in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality issues associated with this abuse. Psychometric tools to screen for IPV need to be incorporated to assist mental health professionals in decision making in risk assessment and safety planning. Further research is needed to improve the psychometric properties of IPV tools in mental health settings, to ensure they are culturally and gender sensitive. Objective: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health priority due to the physical and mental impacts it has on health. No existing reviews have focused on the psychometric properties of IPV screening tools used to screen men and women within a mental health context. This review aimed to identify the best psychometrically tested screening tools available to assess all areas of IPV in men and women in mental health setting. Method: Databases psycArticles, PsycINFO, Social Science, CINAHL, PubMed and Cochrane were searched from their starting date through to July 2015. Eligible studies were published in peer-reviewed publications in English. Results: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Ten IPV screening tools were identified. Three tools assessed all areas of IPV and were validated against an appropriate reference standard. One study tested IPV screening tool in a mental health setting. Conclusion: Mental health nurses need to incorporate a psychometrically tested IPV tool as part of risk assessment and safety planning for clients. This review identified three tools that are suitable for identifying IPV in a mental health context. However, further research is necessary to validate IPV screening tools that are culturally sensitive and have been validated with men and women.",2016-04-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing,16796,39,23,Measures for screening for intimate partner violence: A systematic review,0,false,10.1111/jpm.12289,Blackwell Publishing Ltdcustomerservices@oxonblackwellpublishing.com,Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing,2016.0,84.0,4.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Mental health nurses need to incorporate a psychometrically tested IPV tool as part of risk assessment and safety planning for clients, and three tools are identified that are suitable for identifying IPV in a mental health context.'}",1272,82145257,B.

1273,"© 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.Although the majority of adulthood sexual violence involves a male perpetrator and a female victim, there is also substantial evidence that members of both genders can be victims and perpetrators of sexual violence. As an alternative to viewing sexual violence within gender-specific terms, we advocate for the use of a gender inclusive conceptualization of sexual aggression that takes into account the factors that contribute to sexual victimization of, and victimization by, both men and women. The goal of the current review is to examine the need and importance of a gender inclusive conceptualization of sexual violence and to discuss how compatible our current theories are with this conceptualization. First, we examine evidence of how a gender-specific conceptualization of sexual violence aids in obscuring assault experiences that are not male to female and how this impacts victims of such violence. We specifically discuss this impact regarding research, law, public awareness, advocacy, and available victim treatment and resources. Next, we provide an overview of a number of major sexual violence theories that are relevant for adult perpetrators and adult victims, including neurobiological and integrated biological theories, evolutionary psychology theory, routine activity theory, feminist theory, social learning and related theories, typology approaches, and integrated theories. We critically examine these theories’ applicability to thinking about sexual violence through a gender inclusive lens. Finally, we discuss further directions for research, clinical interventions, and advocacy in this area. Specifically, we encourage sexual violence researchers and clinicians to identify and utilize appropriate theoretical frameworks and to apply these frameworks in ways that incorporate a full range of sexual violence.",2016-04-01,Journal,Article,"Trauma, Violence, and Abuse",13124,43,17,"An Examination of the Gender Inclusiveness of Current Theories of Sexual Violence in Adulthood: Recognizing Male Victims, Female Perpetrators, and Same-Sex Violence",0,false,10.1177/1524838014566721,SAGE Publications Ltd,"Trauma, Violence, & Abuse",2016.0,167.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Evidence of how a gender-specific conceptualization of sexual violence aids in obscuring assault experiences that are not male to female is examined and how this impacts victims of such violence.'}",1273,6796562,Jessica A.

Specifically, we identify distinct subgroups of adolescents based on past-year TDV victimization, whether adolescents change victimization statuses over time (e.g., from psychological victimization to physical victimization), and how exposure to interparental violence and gender influence the prevalence and stability of TDV statuses. Adolescents (N=1,042) from 7 public high schools in Texas participated in this longitudinal study. The Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI) (Wolfe et al., Psychological Assessment, 13(2), 277–293, 2001) was used to identify victimization statuses. Latent Transition Analysis (LTA) with measurement invariance was used to examine transition probability of an individual’s latent status at Wave3 or Wave4 given his or her latent status at Wave2 or Wave3. Gender and exposure to interparental violence was included as moderators in the LTA. Three statuses of TDV victimization were identified: (1) non-victims; (2) emotional/verbal victims; and (3) physical/psychological victims. LTA showed that the majority of adolescents stayed in the same status over time; however, female youth exposed to interparental violence were more likely to move from a less to more severe status over time compared to non-exposed youth. This is among the first study to identify subgroups of TDV victimization and to examine the stability of group membership over time.

1275,"© 2015 American Psychological Association.Gender-based violence (GBV) is prevalent and associated with deleterious outcomes including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance use disorders. Despite substantial comorbidity between these conditions and personality disorders (PDs), few, if any, studies have examined associations between lifetime exposure to GBV and risk for a range of PDs in nationally representative U.S. samples. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs) of 10 PDs by lifetime GBV exposure. Participants were 20,089 women who participated in wave 2 (2004-2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions.

1277,"© 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the differential use of the Lethality Assessment Program (LAP) – a risk-informed, collaborative police-social service intervention – across female victim-survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) in four police jurisdictions in Oklahoma. Design/methodology/approach – Women visited by the police during the study period participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. Logistic regression was utilized to examine what factors impacted implementation of the LAP. Findings – There was differential use of the intervention based on the following: jurisdiction, severe violence at the incident, perpetrator’s use of a weapon ever in the relationship, PTSD symptomology, and women’s prior protective actions and utilization of domestic violence advocacy services. Research limitations/implications – Future research should examine the decision-making process of survivors and police officers to better elucidate the meaning behind these statistical relationships. Practical implications – PTSD education should be an integral part of police training on domestic violence. In addition, officers should be trained to recognize less injurious, but also damaging, forms of IPV, such as verbal abuse and coercive control. Social implications – While police contact can provide accountability for the offender, the social service system is best equipped to provide safety options for the victim-survivor of violence. Originality/value – Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the LAP. It is important to understand how the intervention is applied in order to better understand who is most assisted by the intervention and what training or education could be beneficial for officers providing the intervention.",2016-03-21,Journal,Article,Policing,21541,9,39,The lethality assessment program: Which survivors of intimate partner violence are most likely to participate?,0,false,10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2015-0094,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.Howard HouseWagon Lane, BingleyBD16 1WA",,2016.0,42.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""There was differential use of the intervention based on the following: jurisdiction, severe violence at the incident, perpetrator’s use of a weapon ever in the relationship, PTSD symptomology, and women’'s prior protective actions and utilization of domestic violence advocacy services.""}",1277,8130560,J.

1278,"© 2016 Deuba et al.Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an urgent public health priority. It is a neglected issue in women's health, especially in urban slums in Nepal and globally. This study was designed to better understand the IPV experienced by young pregnant women in urban slums of the Kathmandu Valley, as well as to identify their coping strategies, care and support seeking behaviours. Womens' views on ways to prevent IPV were also addressed. Methods: 20 young pregnant women from 13 urban slums in the Kathmandu valley were recruited purposively for this qualitative study, based on pre-defined criteria. In-depth interviews were conducted and transcribed, with qualitative content analysis used to analyse the transcripts. Results: 14 respondents were survivors of violence in urban slums. Their intimate partner(s) committed most of the violent acts. These young pregnant women were more likely to experience different forms of violence (psychological, physical and sexual) if they refused to have sex, gave birth to a girl, or if their husband had alcohol use disorder. The identification of foetal gender also increased the experience of physical violence at the prenatal stage. Interference from in-laws prevented further escalation of physical abuse. The most common coping strategy adopted to avoid violence among these women was to tolerate and accept the husbands' abuse because of economic dependence. Violence survivors sought informal support from their close family members. Women suggested multiple short and long term actions to reduce intimate partner violence such as female education, economic independence of young women, banning identification of foetal gender during pregnancy and establishing separate institutions within their community to handle violence against young pregnant women. Conclusions: Diversity in the design and implementation of culturally and socially acceptable interventions might be effective in addressing violence against young pregnant women in humanitarian settings such as urban slums. These include, but are not limited to, treatment of alcohol use disorder, raising men's awareness about pregnancy, addressing young women's economic vulnerability, emphasising the role of health care professionals in preventing adverse consequences resulting from gender selection technologies and working with family members of violence survivors.",2016-03-05,Journal,Article,BMC Women's Health,19499,35,16,"Experience of intimate partner violence among young pregnant women in urban slums of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal: A qualitative study",1,true,10.1186/s12905-016-0293-7,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Women's Health,2016.0,60.0,6.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Diversity in the design and implementation of culturally and socially acceptable interventions might be effective in addressing violence against young pregnant women in humanitarian settings such as urban slums.'}",1278,4954000,K.

To examine protective and risk factors related to child gender in LMIC around the world, we used data from more than 2 million individuals in 400,000 families in 41 LMIC collected in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, a household survey that includes nationally representative samples of participating countries. In the first chapter of this monograph, we describe the conceptual ""gender similarities"" and ""bioecological"" frameworks that helped guide the monograph. In the second chapter, we detail the general methodology adhered to in the substantive chapters. Then, in topical chapters, we describe the situations of girls and boys with successive foci on child growth and mortality, parental caregiving, family discipline and violence, and child labor. We conclude with a general discussion of findings from the substantive chapters in the context of gender and bioecological theories.

1282,"© 2015, The Author(s) 2015.We report a meta-analytic review of studies examining the relations among harmful workplace experiences and women’s occupational well-being. Based on previous research, a classification of harmful workplace experiences affecting women is proposed and then used in the analysis of 88 studies with 93 independent samples, containing 73,877 working women. We compare the associations of different harmful workplace experiences and job stressors with women’s work attitudes and health. Random-effects meta-analysis and path analysis showed that more intense yet less frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention) and less intense but more frequent harmful experiences (e.g., sexist organizational climate and gender harassment) had similar negative effects on women’s well-being. Harmful workplace experiences were independent from and as negative as job stressors in their impact on women’s occupational well-being. The power imbalance between the target and the perpetrator appeared as a potential factor to explain the type and impact of harmful workplace experiences affecting women’s occupational well-being. In the discussion, we identify several gaps in the literature, suggest directions for future research, and suggest organizational policy changes and interventions that could be effective at reducing the incidence of harmful workplace experiences.

1284,"© 2016 C. P. Pitter.Introduction: Gender-based violence (GBV) can have devastating consequences for pregnancy because both mother and child are at risk. Midwives are in a strategic position to identify and empower pregnant women experiencing GBV; however, currently midwives in Jamaica are not required to screen for GBV, neither are they prepared to do so. Aim: This study forms the baseline of a larger study designed to improve the capacity of midwives to identify and treat pregnant women experiencing GBV in Jamaica. This specific component assessed midwives' knowledge and attitudes when encountering GBV in their practice in Kingston, Jamaica. Methods: A qualitative study design was used. Six practicing midwives were purposely selected to participate in a focus group discussion at the antenatal clinic of a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. Results: All six respondents said it was very important to screen for GBV among pregnant women in their care. The findings from their report revolved around six themes, namely midwives have suboptimal knowledge, are exposed to women experiencing GBV in pregnancy, lack professional preparedness, report gaps in the institutional framework to guide their practice, are concerned for their safety and security, and are willing to intervene. Conclusion: This study confirmed that midwives are aware of the problem and are willing to intervene but are faced with lack of formal procedures to detect and treat pregnant women who are experiencing GBV. Findings could be used to inform a protocol which is being developed to guide midwives' practice. Findings could also be incorporated in the national strategy to eliminate GBV.",2016-02-15,Journal,Article,International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being,11800154595,8,11,"Midwives' knowledge and attitudes when encountering Gender-Based Violence in their practice at a maternityhospital in Kingston, Jamaica",1,true,10.3402/qhw.v11.29358,Co-Action Publishinginfo@co-action.net,International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health & Well-Being,2016.0,22.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study confirmed that midwives are aware of the problem and are willing to intervene but are faced with lack of formal procedures to detect and treat pregnant women who are experiencing GBV.'}",1284,31868384,C.

1285,"© 2016 Vu et al.Background: Refugees and internally displaced persons who are affected by armed-conflict are at increased vulnerability to some forms of sexual violence or other types of gender-based violence. A validated, brief and easy-to-administer screening tool will help service providers identify GBV survivors and refer them to appropriate GBV services. To date, no such GBV screening tool exists. We developed the 7-item ASIST-GBV screening tool from qualitative research that included individual interviews and focus groups with GBV refugee and IDP survivors. This study presents the psychometric properties of the ASIST-GBV with female refugees living in Ethiopia and IDPs in Colombia. Methods: Several strategies were used to validate ASIST-GBV, including a 3 month implementation to validate the brief screening tool with women/girls seeking health services, aged ≥15 years in Ethiopia (N = 487) and female IDPs aged ≥ 18 years in Colombia (N = 511). Results: High proportions of women screened positive for past-year GBV according to the ASIST-GBV: 50.6 % in Ethiopia and 63.4 % in Colombia. The factor analysis identified a single dimension, meaning that all items loaded on the single factor. Cronbach's α = 0.77. A 2-parameter logistic IRT model was used for estimating the precision and discriminating power of each item. Item difficulty varied across the continuum of GBV experiences in the following order (lowest to highest): threats of violence (0.690), physical violence (1.28), forced sex (2.49), coercive sex for survival (2.25), forced marriage (3.51), and forced pregnancy (6.33). Discrimination results showed that forced pregnancy was the item with the strongest ability to discriminate between different levels of GBV. Physical violence and forced sex also have higher levels of discrimination with threats of violence discriminating among women at the low end of the GBV continuum and coercive sex for survival among women at the mid-range of the continuum. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that the ASIST-GBV has strong psychometric properties and good reliability. The tool can be used to screen and identify female GBV survivors confidentially and efficiently among IDPs in Colombia and refugees in Ethiopia.

1286,"© 2016 Onu et al.Background: Mental disorders are the leading global cause of years lived with disability; the majority of this burden exists in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Over half of mental illness is attributable to depression and anxiety disorders, both of which have known treatments. While the scarcity of mental health care providers is recognized as a major contributor to the magnitude of untreated disorders in LMICs, studies in LMICs find that evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety disorders, such as brief, structured psychotherapies, are feasible, acceptable and have strong efficacy when delivered by local non-specialist personnel. However, most mental health treatment studies using non-specialist providers in LMICs deploy traditional efficacy designs (T1) without the benefit of integrated mental health treatment models shown to succeed over vertical interventions or methods derived from new implementation science to speed policy change. Here, we describe an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study that evaluates non-specialist delivery of mental health treatment within an HIV clinic for HIV-positive (HIV+) women affected by gender- based violence (GBV) (HIV+ GBV+) in the Nyanza region of Kenya. Methods/Design: In this effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I design, 200 HIV+ women with major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who are receiving care at a Family AIDS Care Education and Services (FACES)-supported clinic in Kisumu, Kenya will be randomized to: (1) interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)+treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) TAU, both delivered within the HIV clinic. IPT will consist of 12 weekly 60-minute individual IPT sessions, delivered by non-specialists trained to provide IPT. Primary effectiveness outcomes will include MDD and PTSD diagnosis on the Mini International Diagnostic Interview (MINI). Primary implementation outcomes will include treatment cost-benefit, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity of the IPT delivery within an HIV clinic. Discussion: This trial leverages newly defined effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs to gather data on mental health treatment implementation within an HIV care clinic, while testing the effectiveness of an evidence-based treatment for use with a large underserved population (HIV+ GBV+ women) in Kenya.

Methods: Data were analyzed fromthe first two phases of the Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE). The ED-SAFE study, a quasiexperimental, interrupted time-series design, involved participation from eight general medical EDs across the United States. Participants included adults presenting to the ED with active suicidal ideation or an attempt in the past week. Data collection included baseline interview; six-and 12-month chart reviews; and six-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 52-week telephone follow-up assessments. Regression analyseswere conducted.

1291,"© 2016 International Association of Forensic Mental Health Services.Over the past three decades, much has been learned about risk factors associated with violence. Subsequently, significant advances have occurred in terms of the conceptualization as well as the communication of violence risk; in particular, numerous risk assessment measures have been developed in order to inform violence prevention efforts. However, most such instruments have been validated predominantly in male populations and research examining their application across genders is scarce. This study investigated the performance of one of the most established violence risk assessment schemes—the Historical/Clinical/Risk Management-20 (HCR-20)—in a sample of 52 men and 48 women receiving short-term inpatient psychiatric care. Results indicated that the HCR-20 as well as its components predicted both the occurrence and imminence of violent outcomes and gender did not moderate those relationships. Exploratory analyses revealed gender differences in the baseline item and scale ratings.

1292,"© 2016 International Association of Forensic Mental Health Services.Gender differences were explored in PCL-R codings and the manifestation of psychopathy in 197 female and 197 male patients admitted between 1984 and 2013 to one of four Dutch forensic psychiatric hospitals. Four groups were compared with respect to criminological characteristics, historical violence risk factors and psychiatric characteristics including incidents during treatment. The lowered PCL-R cut-off score of 23 as applied in the Female Additional Manual (FAM; de Vogel, de Vries Robbé, van Kalmthout, & Place, 2012) was used to define women with psychopathy. The four groups were: (1) women without psychopathy (PCL-R < 23), (2) women with psychopathy (PCL-R ≥ 23), (3) men without psychopathy (PCL-R < 30), and (4) men with psychopathy (PCL-R ≥ 30). Overall, it was found that women and men with psychopathy show multiple similarities in their personal and criminal histories, but there were also several gender differences. Women with psychopathy compared to men with psychopathy committed more fraud, offended more often out of relational frustration, were more often diagnosed with the Borderline Personality Disorder, and showed less physical violence, but more manipulative and self-destructive behavior during treatment. Overall, women obtained lower scores on the PCL-R than men. Predictive validity of the PCL-R for physical violence during treatment was good for men and moderate for women.

Psychotherapeutic and psychosocial treatments were also reviewed. Adolescents with paraphilic disorders specifically present a different therapeutic challenge as compared to adults. In part, the challenge relates to adolescents being in various stages of puberty and development, which may limit the use of certain pharmacological agents due to their potential side effects. In addition, most of the published treatment programmes have used cognitive behavioural interventions, family therapies and psychoeducational interventions. Psychological treatment is predicated in adolescents on the notion that sexually deviant behaviour can be controlled by the offender, and that more adaptive behaviours can be learned.The main purposes of these guidelines are to improve the quality of care and to aid physicians in their clinical decisions.

A logical explanation for the different mental health outcomes of individuals exposed to trauma would seem to be personality factors and thought control strategies. Trauma exposure is necessary but not sufficient for the development of PTSD. To this end, we assess the role of personality traits and coping styles in PTSD vulnerability among Israeli and Palestinian students amid conflict. We also determine whether gender and exposure level to trauma impact the likelihood of the onset of PTSD symptoms. Five questionnaires assess previous trauma, PTSD symptoms, demographics, personality factors and thought control strategies, which are analyzed using path analysis. Findings show that the importance of personality factors and thought control strategies in predicting vulnerability increases in the face of political violence: the higher stress, the more important the roles of personality and thought control strategies. Thought control strategies associated with introverted and less emotionally stable personality-types correlate positively with higher levels of PTSD symptoms and depression, particularly among Palestinians. By extension, because mental health is key to reducing violence in the region, PTSD reduction in conflict zones warrants rethinking.",2016-01-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,5,11,How personality affects vulnerability among Israelis and Palestinians following the 2009 Gaza conflict,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0156278,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,PLoS ONE,2016.0,74.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The role of personality traits and coping styles in PTSD vulnerability among Israeli and Palestinian students amid conflict and the importance of personality factors and thought control strategies in predicting vulnerability increases in the face of political violence.'}",1295,3480568,Daphna Canetti,3587313,S.

Main outcome measures Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, Structured Clinical Interview, Exposure to Violence Questionnaire (EVQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and Functional Social Support Questionnaire (Duke-UNC-11). Results Of the total sample, 31.4% had social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder was highly correlated with age (r = −0.181; CI = 0.061–0.264; P =.009) and depression (r = 0.345; CI = 0.213–0.468; P < .001); it is strongly associated to current cannabis use (relative risk [RR] = 1.251; CI = 1.070–1.463; P =.001) and lifetime suicidal ideation (RR = 1.902; CI 1.286–2.814; P <.001).

1301,"© 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore agency pathways and the management of risk for economically disadvantaged adolescent victims and perpetrators of domestic violence and abuse (DVA). In spite of recent national and international initiatives to raise the profile of this issue, significant gaps within DVA services exist within an urban district situated in the North West of England, UK. The study aims to present qualitative data gathered from service-users and service managers who have knowledge of referral pathways within the district. The paper also aims to examine the discursive relationships between the context, the intersectional significance of age, gender and class and the high levels of risk for survivors and perpetrators. Design/methodology/approach: A purposive sampling strategy utilises phenomenology to explore participants lived experience of DVA. The study seeks to unite phenomenology and hermeneutics to help develop an understanding of adolescent DVA and participant’s experiences of available services. Knowledge of these experiences was garnered through shared narratives. Findings: Through privileging the experiences and knowledge of survivors and practitioners, this study found current DVA service provision for survivors and perpetrators is limited and practitioner interventions can be oppressive without adequate training. These limitations are clearly at odds with national and international efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. This paper highlights significant risks for adolescent survivors and suggests ways in which targeted support might be improved. The findings conclude that central government and local councils might confront the impact of intersecting oppressions by addressing “classed sexism” in early intervention and educational strategies to effect lasting change. Research limitations/implications: Although the study is limited by a lack of participation from perpetrators, the data reveals worrying levels of risk, a reduction in funding pathways and a need for training for all statutory professionals. Additionally, another possible limitation of this study is that terms such as class, gender and heterosexuality were not defined by participants. Practical implications: The paper considers the macroeconomic legacy of neoliberalism, suggesting that investing in early educational approaches, young person focused programmes and appropriate “classed sexism” training for statutory services is crucial for minimising risk. Social implications: To understand the experience of DVA, the intersections of class, gender and age warrants further consideration, particularly in light of claims that socio-economic and ethnic marginalisation has the potential to increase the risk of exposure to interpersonal violence. Originality/value: This original research project prioritises participant knowledge and expertise in the hope of minimising risks for adolescent survivors and perpetrators of domestic violence (DVA). This paper privileges the voices and lived experiences of survivors and professionals who have expertise in DVA.",2016-01-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare,21100834354,3,9,Intersectionality and adolescent domestic violence and abuse: addressing “classed sexism” and improving service provision,2,,10.1108/IJHRH-08-2015-0026,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.Howard HouseWagon Lane, BingleyBD16 1WA",,2016.0,35.0,0.0,,1301,1484588688,R.

Neuropsychological impairment is highly related to functional outcomes in patients with psychiatric disorders, and several studies have suggested an association between neuropsychological impairment and violent behaviors. However, there have been no studies of neuropsychological impairment in forensic patients covered by the Japanese legislation. This study is designed to examine the neuropsychological characteristics of forensic patients in comparison to healthy controls and to assess the relationship between neuropsychological impairment and violence risk. Methods Seventy-one forensic patients with psychiatric disorders and 54 healthy controls (matched by age, gender, and education) were enrolled. The CogState Battery (CSB) consisting of eight cognitive domains, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to test emotion-based decision making, and psychological measures of violence risk including psychopathy were used. Results Forensic patients exhibited poorer performances on all CSB subtests and the IGT than controls. For each group, partial correlational analyses indicated that poor IGT performance was related to psychopathy, especially antisocial behavior. In forensic patients, the CSB composite score was associated with risk factors for future violent behavior, including stress and noncompliance with remediation attempts. Conclusion Forensic patients with psychiatric disorders exhibit a wide range of neuropsychological impairments, and these findings suggest that neuropsychological impairment may increase the risk of violent behavior. Therefore, the treatment of neuropsychological impairment in forensic patients with psychiatric disorders is necessary to improve functional outcomes as well as to prevent violence.",2016-01-01,Journal,Article,PLoS ONE,10600153309,11,11,Neuropsychological impairment and its association with violence risk in Japanese forensic psychiatric patients: A case-control study,1,true,10.1371/journal.pone.0148354,Public Library of Scienceplos@plos.org,PLoS ONE,2016.0,67.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'In forensic patients, the CSB composite score was associated with risk factors for future violent behavior, including stress and noncompliance with remediation attempts, and these findings suggest that neuropsychological impairment may increase the risk of violent behavior.'}",1310,33047151,Hirofumi Nishinaka,4092957,J.

This review article summarizes the available literature on the determinants, prevention, therapy and tools for prediction of serious interpersonal aggression in the context of people with mental disorders. The risks for violence against other people show substantial variation between the various diagnoses. Schizophrenia and mania carry a clearly increased risk particularly at the onset of the disorder but disease-specific pharmacological therapy can reduce these risks. The highest risk factors are in particular previous violence, misuse of alcohol and drugs, male gender and young age. Probabilistic predictions of subsequent aggression against others on an individual-specific basis are only feasible in enriched populations (especially persons with mental illnesses and a previous history of assaults).

Participants originated from countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Analysis revealed the following themes: abuse by parents and caregivers, abuse by peers and school personnel, having nowhere to turn, and dealing with psychological distress. Findings indicate that participants experienced severe verbal, physical, and sexual abuse throughout childhood and adolescence and that this abuse occurred at home, in school, and in the community.

The aim of this study was to describe homicide mortality trends in Chile between 2000 and 2012 by year, gender, age group, geographic distribution (by zone and by region) and type of homicide. Methods: This was a population-based study. Data for homicide mortality in Chile between 2000 and 2012 were used and they were provided by the Chilean Ministry of Health's Department of Statistics and Health Information (DEIS) and PAHO/WHO. The homicide mortality rates were calculated per 100,000 inhabitants. The study variables were year, geographic distribution, gender, age group and type of homicide. The annual percentage change (APC) of the rates was analyzed, and a logarithm of the rates by year and region was fitted by applying linear regression models. In addition, relative risks (RR) were calculated. 95 % confidence intervals were considered in all the analyses. Results: The average yearly rate of homicide (HMR) in Chile (2000-2012) was 4.9. The rates were higher in men (8.7) than in women (1.1), with a RR of 8.2. The rates were higher in the country's central zone (5.0), increasing in recent years in the southern zone, with a significant positive APC of 1.1 %. The Aisén Region had the highest rate (7.6), although Antofagasta was the region with the most significant APC (3.1 %). The highest rate (9.2) was verified in the 25 to 39 age group. The highest rate (5.5) was recorded in 2005. The most frequent type of homicide was assault with an object (44.8 %).

Drawing upon theories that explain the drivers of violence, we examine how gender norms, including norms and social constructions of masculinity, are at the root of most physical violence perpetration by men against women and against other men.

Methods: The study cohort consisted of patients who visited the PES of Taipei City Psychiatric Center from January 2009 to December 2010.

Results: Among the 7656 psychiatric emergency visits, 3029 (39.6%) were referred by the police. These patients referred by police were more likely to be male and aged between 30 to 49 years. Clinical factors related to police referrals including a higher triage assessment level, chief problems included violence, disturbance, substance use, less anxiety, and a diagnosis of unspecified psychosis. The triage assessment level and chief problems assessed by nurses were major predictors. These patients tended to be referred from the catchment area and during the nighttime shift, were discharged during the daytime shift, and stayed longer in the PES.

1321,"© 2015 Taylor & Francis.This paper provides a critical assessment of efforts to involve men in the prevention of men's violence against women. Although there is a substantial evidence base attesting to the effectiveness of at least some strategies and interventions, this field is also limited in important ways. Violence prevention efforts often have focused on changing men's attitudes, rather than also seeking to transform structural and institutional inequalities. While feminist and queer scholarship has explored diversities and pluralities in the organisation of sexuality, much violence prevention work often assumes a homogenously heterosexual male constituency. Too often this work is conceptually simplistic with regard to gender. Against this background, this paper contests and complicates several assumptions that are part of an emerging consensus in men's violence prevention: first, that it is in men's interests to support progress towards non-violence and gender equality; second, that the best people to engage and work with men are other men; and finally, the strengths and limitations of inviting and drawing on ‘real men’.

A mixed-methods study with quantitative and qualitative phases was conducted among MSM and transgender women in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Methods included respondent-driven sampling (RDS) with structured socio-behavioral surveys (N = 313) as well as qualitative methods including 30 indepth interviews and 2 focus group discussions.

A descriptive typology of common scenarios was constructed based on the specific incidents of sexual violence shared by respondents in the qualitative phase (37 incidents across 28 interviews and 2 focus groups). Eight major types of sexual violence were identified, most frequent of which were bias-motivated street violence and alcohol-involved party-related violence. Many vulnerabilities to and consequences of sexual violence described during the qualitative phase were also independently associated with forced sex, including alcohol use at least once per week (AOR = 3.39, 95% CI:1.69-6.81), and having received payment for sex (AOR = 2.77, 95% CI:1.14-6.75).

1323,"© 2015 School of Criminal Justice, Michigan State University.Recent research suggests that there are links between terrorism and gender inequality. This study is a cross-national times series estimation for 57 countries for the period 1994–2002 to examine the impact of attitudes and actual outcomes of gender equality on levels of terrorism experienced by a country using World Values Survey and Global Terrorism Database. The results suggest that actual outcomes of gender equality have a significant and consistently negative impact on terrorism.

Methods: 139,925 persons (107,573 men) identified from a saliva test for opiate and cocaine metabolites following arrest in England and Wales, 1 April 2005-31 March 2009, were case-linked with 2-year recorded offending history. The prior offending rate, accounting for estimated incarceration periods, was calculated by: drug-test outcome; gender; four main crime categories (acquisitive, non-acquisitive, serious acquisitive, and non-serious acquisitive) and 16 sub-categories. Rate ratio (RR) compared opiate and/or cocaine positive to dual-negative testers. Adjusted rate ratio (aRR) controlled for age at drug test. Results: The relationship between testing positive for opiates and cocaine and prior 2-year offending was greater for women than men (aRR men 1.77; 95% CI: 1.75-1.79: women 3.51; 3.45-3.58). The association was weaker for those testing positive for opiates only (aRR: men: 1.66, 1.64-1.68; women 2.73, 2.66-2.80). Men testing positive for cocaine only had a lower rate of prior offending (aRR: 0.93, 0.92-0.94), women had a higher rate (aRR: 1.69, 1.64-1.74). The strongest associations were for non-serious acquisitive crimes (e.g. dually-positive: prostitution (women-only): aRR 24.9, 20.9-29.7; shoplifting: aRR men 4.05, 3.95-4.16; women 6.16, 5.92-6.41). Testing positive for opiates and cocaine was associated with violent offences among women (aRR: 1.54, 1.40-1.69) but not men (aRR: 0.98, 0.93-1.02).

Previous research has shown having a peer social network can reduce sex workers' risks of victimization. However, mechanisms of how social network impacts violence among female street-based sex workers are still far from clear. Methods Our study was based on data abstracted from a paper-and-pencil survey administered among 218 female street-based sex workers in Shanghai, China. We focused on selfreported client-initiated violence and intimate-partner violence in emotional, physical, and sexual forms. Social networks were characterized by the size and sources of financial and psychosocial support (e.g. family, friends, and peers). Multi-variable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of each type of violence exposure by social network structure after the adjustment of age, education, and years in Shanghai. Results The street-based female sex workers in our study were primarily rural-to-urban migrants (95.7%) with an average age of 41 years old. 24.3%and 62.8% of the sex workers reported intimate-partner violence and client-initiated violence respectively. Lack of financial support, as defined by having only one individual or none in her peer support system to help financially, was significantly associated with self-reported intimate-partner violence (AOR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.9). Respondents who reported client-initiated violence, by contrast, were more likely to report lacked psychosocial support from family (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.0-4.6) and peers (AOR: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.2-11). Conclusion This study is one of the first to systematically analyze the associations between social network and gender-based violence among street-based female sex worker. We reported a high prevalence of both types of gender-based violence and their complex associations with family, friends, and peer support network.

Using official police data, 1,256 individuals are initially differentiated by their role as the victim or the offender in an IPV incident and then categorized into four distinct groups (e.g., as victims, persistent offenders, desistent offenders, or victim-offenders) based on their role in further officially recorded IPV incidents during an 18-to 30-month follow-up period. Of particular interest is the victim-offender category, which involves individuals who switched roles from the original IPV incident (e.g., IPV victims who later became IPV offenders or IPV offenders who later became IPV victims). Results suggest that important distinctions exist across categories related to sex and crime exposure.

1328,"© 2015 Alameddine et al.Background: Healthcare institutions have commonly reported exposure of employees, particularly nurses, to high levels of occupational violence. Despite such evidence in the Middle East Region, there is a dearth of national studies that have systematically investigated this phenomenon. This study investigates the prevalence, characteristics, consequences and factors associated with nurses' exposure to occupational violence in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional design was utilized to survey a nationally representative sample of 915 nurses registered with the Order of Nurses in Lebanon. Stratified random sampling by gov-ernorate was utilized. Individually-mailed questionnaires collected information on exposure to violence, degree of burnout and demographic/professional background. The main outcome variables were exposure to verbal abuse (never, 1-3,4-9 and 10+times) and physical violence (never, ever) over the past 12-months. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate prevalence of violence. Multivariable, binomial and multinomial regression models were carried out to investigate the correlates of exposure to verbal abuse and physical violence, respectively. Results: Response rate was 64.8%. Over the last year, prevalence of nurses' exposure to verbal abuse was 62%, (CI: 58-65%) and physical violence was 10%, (CI: 8-13%). Among respondents, 31.7% of nurses indicated likelihood to quit their jobs and 22.3% were undetermined. Furthermore, 54.1% reported high levels of emotional exhaustion and 28.8% reported high levels of depersonalization. Compared to nurses with no exposure to verbal abuse, nurses reporting high exposure had high levels of emotional exhaustion (OR:6.4; CI:1.76-23.32), depersonalization (OR:6.8; CI: 3-15) and intention to quit job (OR:3.9; CI: 1.8-8.3). They further reported absence of anti-violence policies at their institutions (OR: 3; CI: 1.5-6.3). Nurses that were ever exposed to physical violence were more likely to be males (OR: 2.2; CI: 1.1-4.3), working day and night shifts (OR: 2.8; CI: 1.4-5.5) and subject to ten or more incidents of verbal abuse per year (OR: 46.7; CI: 10.1-214). Conclusions: An alarming two-thirds of respondents reported exposure to verbal abuse which was found to be a significant predictor of the three subscales of burnout, intention to quit and exposure to physical violence. The prevalence of exposure to physical violence is disconcerting due to its severe consequences. Policy and decision-makers are urged to use study findings for policy and practice interventions to create safe work environments conducive to nurses' productivity and retention.

Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge and POPLINE databases for studies published between January 2000 and June 2014. We also searched the websites of organizations active in humanitarian emergencies. We included studies reporting the development or use of data collection tools concerning the health of women and children in humanitarian emergencies. We used narrative synthesis to summarize the studies. Findings We identified 100 studies: 80 reported on conflict situations and 20 followed natural disasters. Most studies (76/100) focused on the health status of the affected population while 24 focused on the availability and coverage of health services. Of 17 different data collection tools identified, 14 focused on sexual and reproductive health, nine concerned maternal, newborn and child health and four were used to collect information on sexual or gender-based violence. Sixty-nine studies were done for monitoring and evaluation purposes, 18 for advocacy, seven for operational research and six for needs assessment. Conclusion Practical and effective means of data collection are needed to inform life-saving actions in humanitarian emergencies.

For the literature review, searches were conducted for relevant articles, and data were drawn from national population- and school-based surveys and from the Global Burden of Disease project. In some parts of the Arab world, adolescents experience a greater burden of ill health due to overweight/obesity, transport injuries, cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, and mental health disorders than those in other regions of the world. Poor diets, insufficient physical activity, tobacco use, road traffic injuries, and exposure to violence are major risk factors. Young men have higher risks of unsafe driving and tobacco use and young women have greater ill-health due to depression. Several features of the social context that affect adolescent health are discussed, including changing life trajectories and gender roles, the mismatch between education and job opportunities, and armed conflict and interpersonal violence.

Evidence from 32 nations is summarized on the percent of couples in each DCT. It indicates that across all nations, sample types, and gender of respondent, and regardless of whether the aggression was physical, psychological, or sexual, aggression in a family dyadic relationship was most often by both members of the dyad. When there was a sole perpetrator, although there was more variation in the percent in each DCT, the results tended to show a similar percent of Male-Only and Female-Only perpetration. Studies cited show that DCTs provide information that is beyond that obtained by analyses of the individual-level variables used to identify the DCTs. This reflects the family systems theory principle that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Statistically, it is analogous to the additional variance explained by use of interaction terms in a causal model.

1336,"© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Background: Little is known about differences in alcohol use and alcohol-related problems between transgender- and nontransgender-identified populations. Using data from a large-scale health survey, we compare the drinking patterns and prevalence of alcohol-related problems of transgender-identified individuals to nontransgender-identified males and females. For transgender-identified people, we examine how various forms of victimization relate to heavy episodic drinking (HED). Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were completed by 75,192 students aged 18-29 years attending 120 post-secondary educational institutions in the United States from 2011 to 2013. Self-reported measures included alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, victimization, and sociodemographics, including 3 gender-identity groups: transgender-identified individuals; nontransgender-identified males; and nontransgender-identified females. Results: Compared to transgender-identified individuals, nontransgender-identified males were more likely to report HED in the past 2 weeks (relative risk. =. 1.42; p=. 0.006); however, nontransgender-identified males and females reported HED on fewer days than transgender-identified people (incidence-rate ratios [IRRs] ranged from 0.28 to 0.43; p-values. <. 0.001). Compared to transgender-identified people, nontransgender-identified males and females had lower odds of past-year alcohol-related sexual assault and suicidal ideation (odds ratios ranged from 0.24 to 0.45; p-values. < 0.05). Among transgender-identified people, individuals who were sexually assaulted (IRR = 3.21, p= 0.011) or verbally threatened (IRR. = 2.42, p= 0.021) in the past year had greater HED days than those who did not experience those forms of victimization. Conclusions: Compared to transgender-identified people, nontransgender-identified males and females: have fewer HED occasions (despite nontransgender-identified males having greater prevalence of HED); and are at lower risk for alcohol-related sexual assaults and suicidal ideation.

Participants were 69 couples recruited from a large Midwestern university (total N = 138). Participants' trait rumination and reappraisal were measured by self-report. Participants were randomized individually to an alcohol or placebo condition, then recalled an anger event while using 1 of 3 randomly assigned emotion regulation conditions (rumination, reappraisal, or uninstructed). Following this, participants completed an analogue aggression task involving ostensibly assigning white noise blasts to their partner. Participants in the alcohol condition displayed greater IPA than participants in the placebo condition for provoked IPA, but not unprovoked IPA. Results also revealed interactions such that for those in the alcohol and rumination group, higher trait reappraisal was related to lower unprovoked IPA. For provoked IPA, higher trait rumination was related to greater IPA among those in the alcohol and rumination condition and those in the placebo and uninstructed condition. In general, results were consistent with I theory, suggesting that alcohol disinhibits, rumination impels, and trait reappraisal inhibits IPA.

We propose exploring the actual spaces of bodies and planning at the scale of bodies since bodies are at the nexus of public–private spaces, gender identities and gender violence. Using bodies as geographical spaces to understand and analyse visceral experiences and fear of violence may help diminish the dominance of the public–private divide and challenge the unequal rights women have to use space.

1339,"© 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.Sexual aggression is a persistent and prevalent issue in the United States, which often results in a number of psychological, emotional, and physical consequences for victims. The current study examined whether the length of relationship between the victim and perpetrator, level of victim resistance, and observers’ gender role attitudes play a role in observers’ perceptions of an alleged sexual assault. Participants included 297 male college students from a public university in the Northeastern United States. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no significant effects for length of relationship on participants’ attributions. Relative to no resistance, verbal and physical strategies by the victim predicted higher levels of victim credibility, perpetrator culpability, and perpetrator guilt, as well as lower levels of victim culpability and perceived victim pleasure. Endorsement of traditional adversarial sex role beliefs and hostile sexist attitudes, as opposed to egalitarian attitudes, were associated with the attribution of less credibility to the victim, perceived victim trauma, perpetrator culpability, perpetrator guilt, and shorter recommended prison sentences, as well as greater victim culpability and perceived victim pleasure.

1341,"Copyright © 2015 American Medical Association.IMPORTANCE: Interpersonal violence, which includes child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and elder abuse, affects millions of US residents each year. However, surveillance systems, programs, and policies to address violence often lack broad, cross-sector collaboration, and there is limited awareness of effective strategies to prevent violence. OBJECTIVES: To describe the burden of interpersonal violence in the United States, explore challenges to violence prevention efforts and to identify prevention opportunities. DATA SOURCES: We reviewed data from health and law enforcement surveillance systems including the National Vital Statistics System, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, the US Justice Department's National Crime Victimization Survey, the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program. RESULTS: Homicide rates have decreased from a peak of 10.7 per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 5.1 per 100 000 in 2013. Aggravated assault rates have decreased from a peak of 442 per 100 000 in 1992 to 242 per 100 000 in 2012. Nevertheless, annually, there are more than 16 000 homicides and 1.6 million nonfatal assault injuries requiring treatment in emergency departments. More than 12 million adults experience intimate partner violence annually and more than 10 million children younger than 18 years experience some form of maltreatment from a caregiver, ranging from neglect to sexual abuse, but only a small percentage of these violent incidents are reported to law enforcement, health care clinicians, or child protective agencies. Moreover, exposure to violence increases vulnerability to a broad range of mental and physical health problems over the life course; for example, meta-analyses indicate that exposure to physical abuse in childhood is associated with a 54%increased odds of depressive disorder, a 78%increased odds of sexually transmitted illness or risky sexual behavior, and a 32%increased odds of obesity. Rates of violence vary by age, geographic location, sex, and race/ethnicity, and significant disparities exist. Homicide is the leading cause of death for non-Hispanic blacks from age 1 through 44 years, whereas it is the fifth most common cause of death among non-Hispanic whites in this age range. Additionally, efforts to understand, prevent, and respond to interpersonal violence have often neglected the degree to which many forms of violence are interconnected at the individual level, across relationships and communities, and even inter-generationally. The most effective violence prevention strategies include parent and family-focused programs, early childhood education, school-based programs, therapeutic or counseling interventions, and public policy. For example, a systematic review of early childhood home visitation programs found a 38.9%reduction in episodes of child maltreatment in intervention participants compared with control participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Progress has been made in reducing US rates of interpersonal violence even though a significant burden remains. Multiple strategies exist to improve violence prevention efforts, and health care providers are an important part of this solution.",2015-08-04,Journal,Review,JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association,85291,174,314,"Violence in the United States: Status, challenges, and opportunities",2,,10.1001/jama.2015.8371,American Medical Association,JAMA,2015.0,86.0,18.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The burden of interpersonal violence in the United States is described, challenges to violence prevention efforts are explored, and prevention opportunities are identified.'}",1341,39409554,S.

I argue that the DSM became a site where women attempted to tease out issues relating to gender, professionalization, and the power and stakes of labeling. Feminists privileged a sociological reading of gender, which butted up against mental health care workers' professional investment in psychiatric ones. Women's responses to the DSM, however, reveal that the line between the sociological and the pathological was unclear. This debate over labels is exemplified by a proposal to diagnose rapists as mentally ill. Women's advocates framed sexual assault as an issue of violence against women, rather than an issue of male sexuality. For many women, the American Psychiatric Association's proposal implied that rape was a primarily sexual act, and that male socialization needn't be examined. Others, however, saw this as one more way to label and address bad male behavior; psychiatric treatment might not ultimately put an end to rape, but these women saw any sort of treatment as a step forward. For women professionals, this proposal and the DSM more broadly raised questions about whether the 2 frameworks could be integrated, and whether psychological treatments for social problems were appropriate.",2015-08-01,Journal,Article,History of Psychology,14769,4,18,"""The name game"": Feminist protests of the DSM and diagnostic labels in the 1980s",0,false,10.1037/a0039520,American Psychological Association,History of Psychology,2015.0,0.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is argued that the DSM became a site where women attempted to tease out issues relating to gender, professionalization, and the power and stakes of labeling as feminists working in mental health fields grappled with the tensions between their politics and their work.'}",1342,38381864,J.

1343,"© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Background: Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with increased risk for externalizing behavior problems; childhood externalizing behavior problems are linked with subsequent early sexual behavior. The present study examined the effects of PCE on early sexual initiation (sexual intercourse prior to age 15) and whether externalizing behavior in preadolescence mediated the relationship. Methods: Three hundred fifty-four (180 PCE and 174 non-cocaine exposed; 192 girls, 142 boys), primarily African-American, low socioeconomic status, 15-year-old adolescents participated in a prospective longitudinal study. Adolescents' sexual behavior was assessed at 15 years using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. Externalizing behavior was assessed at 12 years using the Youth Self-Report. Results: Logistic regression models indicated that adolescents with PCE (n = 69, 38%) were 2.2 times more likely (95% CI = 1.2-4.1, p< .01) to engage in early sexual intercourse than non-exposed peers (n= 49, 28%) controlling for covariates. This relationship was fully mediated by self-reported externalizing behavior in girls but not in boys, suggesting childhood externalizing behavior as a gender moderated mediator. Blood lead level during preschool years was also related to a greater likelihood of early sexual intercourse (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.4-4.7, p< .002). Greater parental monitoring decreased the likelihood of early sexual intercourse, while violence exposure increased the risk. Conclusions: PCE is related to early sexual intercourse, and externalizing behavior problems mediate PCE effects in female adolescents.

1344,"Copyright © 2015 Sarrasin, Fasel, Green and Helbling.Drawing on psychological and political science research on individuals’ sensitivity to threat cues, the present study examines reactions to political posters that depict male immigrants as a sexual danger. We expect anti-immigrant attitudes to be more strongly predicted by feelings of insecurity or representations of men and women as strong and fragile when individuals are exposed to sexual threat cues than when they are not. Results from two online experiments conducted in Switzerland and Germany largely confirmed these assumptions. Comparing two anti-immigrant posters (general and non-sexual threat vs. sexual threat), Experiment 1 (n = 142) showed that feelings of insecurity were related to an increased support for expelling immigrants from the host country in both cases. However, only in the sexual threat cues condition and among female participants, were perceptions of women as fragile—as measured with benevolent sexism items—related to support for expelling immigrants. Further distinguishing between different forms of violence threat cues, Experiment 2 (n = 181) showed that collective feelings of insecurity were most strongly related to support for expelling immigrants when a male immigrant was presented as a violent criminal. In contrast, benevolent sexist beliefs were related to anti-immigrant stances only when participants were exposed to a depiction of a male immigrant as a rapist. In both cases attitudes were polarized: on the one hand, representations of immigrants as criminals provoked reactance reactions—that is, more positive attitudes—among participants scoring low in insecurity feelings or benevolent sexism. On the other hand, those scoring high in these dimensions expressed slightly more negative attitudes. Overall, by applying social psychological concepts to the study of anti-immigrant political campaigning, the present study demonstrated that individuals are sensitive to specific threat cues in posters.",2015-07-28,Journal,Article,Frontiers in Psychology,21100216571,8,6,When sexual threat cues shape attitudes toward immigrants: the role of insecurity and benevolent sexism,1,true,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01033,Frontiers Media S.A.,Frontiers in Psychology,2015.0,61.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'By applying social psychological concepts to the study of anti-immigrant political campaigning, the present study demonstrated that individuals are sensitive to specific threat cues in posters.'}",1344,5005884,Oriane Sarrasin,40421810,Nicole Fasel,5221224,E.

Results: One hundred and twenty six (28%) of the patients were women and 324 (72%) were men. The mean age was 40.99±17.87 years. Leading trauma mechanisms were motor vehicle accidents, followed by falls and violence. Accidents not involving vehicles and violence were the most frequent causes for trauma in patients with a skull fracture; falls from a height were the most common cause in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cranial CT scans were performed in 73.6% (n=331) of the cases. Among CT scans, 13% were interpreted as abnormal. The most frequent abnormal CT findings included linear fracture (34.9%), subdural hematoma (25.6%) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (16.3%). Conclusion: The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 14, vomiting more than 3 times and scalp laceration were predictors for a high risk of an abnormal cranial CT.

1347,"© 2014 American Psychological Association.Aggression is an important correlate of violence, depression, coping, and suicide among emerging young African American males. Yet most researchers treat aggression deterministically, fail to address cultural factors, or consider the potential for individual characteristics to exert an intersectional influence on this psychosocial outcome. Addressing this gap, we consider the moderating effect of coping on the relationship between masculine and racial identity and aggressive ideation among African American males (N = 128) drawn from 2 large Midwestern universities. Using the phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory and person-centered methodology as a guide, hierarchical cluster analysis grouped participants into profile groups based on their responses to both a measure of racial identity and a measure of masculine identity. Results from the cluster analysis revealed 3 distinct identity clusters: Identity Ambivalent, Identity Appraising, and Identity Consolidated. Although these cluster groups did not differ with regard to coping, significant differences were observed between cluster groups in relation to aggressive ideation. Further, a full model with identity profile clusters, coping, and aggressive ideation indicates that cluster membership significantly moderates the relationship between coping and aggressive ideation. The implications of these data for intersecting identities of African American men, and the association of identity and outcomes related to risk for mental health and violence, are discussed.",2015-07-01,Journal,Article,Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology,14230,12,21,"Chill, be cool man: African American men, identity, coping, and aggressive ideation",2,,10.1037/a0037545,American Psychological Association,Cultural diversity & ethnic minority psychology,2015.0,93.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A full model with identity profile clusters, coping, and aggressive ideation indicates that cluster membership significantly moderates the relationship between coping and aggressive Ideation.'}",1347,49219803,Alvin Thomas,35086865,W.

1348,"© 2015 by De Gruyter.This paper concerns how legal mechanisms intended to address domestic violence (DV) can be better designed to adequately consider its gendered impacts and complexity. I analyze two traditional legal approaches to DV: a focus on women-only mechanisms and a gender-neutral approach. I then analyze two jurisdictions that have adopted such approaches to DV: Brazil and the United States, respectively. While each approach has benefits, both also have significant costs. I argue that it is possible to imagine an alternative, substantially more flexible system that is neither focused on women nor is gender-neutral. This alternative, which I call the mosaic approach (MA), aims at making DV law and policy more effective, and more just, by focusing on a mosaic of vulnerabilities, which may be more or less related to gender. The MA then proposes using an empirically-based mosaic of DV policies that match and address these vulnerabilities. At the core of the MA is an insistence upon an ongoing public scrutiny of the political choices that lurk behind resource allocation and vulnerability prioritization. Because public policy and law require some degree of generality, the risk of stereotyping in policy-design is probably unavoidable. This paper argues that the best response to this concern is to bring it to the very forefront of policy-making by actively grappling with how we categorize and prioritize people.",2015-07-01,Journal,Article,Global Jurist,8000153132,0,15,Harnessing Gender to Law: A Mosaic Approach to Designing Domestic Violence Policy,0,false,10.1515/gj-2014-0024,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,,2015.0,72.0,0.0,,1348,151485253,Joanna Vieira Noronha,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Secondary data analysis of a 2013 community-based survey of transgender adults in Massachusetts (N=452) was conducted. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were fit to examine the relationship of four risk factor domains with SUD treatment history and recent substance use: (1) demographics; (2) gender-related characteristics; (3) mental health; (4) socio-structural factors. Adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were estimated. Results: Ten percent of the sample reported lifetime SUD treatment. Factors associated with significant increase in odds of lifetime SUD treatment alongside recent substance use (all p<. 0.05) were: (1) older age (aOR. =1.02; 95% CI. =1.01-1.04), higher educational attainment (aOR. =3.59; 95% CI. =2.35-5.50), low income (aOR. =0.58; 95% CI. =0.39-0.86); (2) MTF identity (aOR. =3.03; 95% CI. =1.95-4.67), gender-affirming medical care (aOR. =1.99; 95% CI. =1.32-3.00); (3) intimate partner violence (aOR. =1.68; 95% CI. =1.13-2.49), posttraumatic stress disorder (aOR. =2.56; 95% CI. =1.69-3.88), depression (aOR. =2.30; 95% CI. =1.58-3.35), mental health treatment (aOR. =1.65; 95% CI. =1.11-2.45); (4) discrimination (aOR. =1.90; 95% CI. =1.22-2.95), unstable housing (aOR. =1.80; 95% CI. =1.21-2.67), and sex work (aOR. =2.48; 95% CI. =1.24-4.95).

1350,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.This report focuses on the co-occurrence of PTSD-GAD and examines a factor that could operate to maintain both conditions, specifically negative post-trauma cognitions about the self, the world, and self-blame. Two separate help-seeking samples were examined: (a) a mixed gender sample of 301 individuals who had experienced a serious motor vehicle accident (MVA), a single incident, non-interpersonal trauma; and (b) a sample of 157 women who had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV), a recurrent, interpersonal trauma. When examined at the diagnostic level, posttraumatic cognitions for one diagnosis did not vary as a function of whether the other diagnosis was present. In the MVA sample, both diagnosed PTSD and GAD were associated with elevations in negative thoughts about the self. Diagnosed GAD was also significantly associated with negative thoughts about the world. In the IPV sample, diagnosed PTSD was associated with elevations in negative thoughts about the self only. When continuously measured PTSD and GAD were examined, results indicated that negative thoughts about the self showed significant simultaneous associations with PTSD and GAD in both samples. In the MVA sample, negative thoughts about the world and self-blame showed significant associations with PTSD but not with GAD. In the IPV sample, negative thoughts about the world and self-blame were not significantly associated with either PTSD or GAD.

However, there is a wide variation in reported rates of violence in acute psychiatric wards. Objectives: To use meta-analysis to estimate the pooled rate of violence in published studies, and examine the characteristics of the participants, and aspects of the studies themselves that might explain the variation in the reported rates of violence (moderators). Method: Systematic meta-analysis of studies published between January 1995 and December 2014, which reported rates of violence in acute psychiatric wards of general or psychiatric hospitals in high-income countries. Results: Of the 23,972 inpatients described in 35 studies, the pooled proportion of patients who committed at least one act of violence was 17% (95% confidence interval (CI) 14-20%). Studies with higher proportions of male patients, involuntary patients, patients with schizophrenia and patients with alcohol use disorder reported higher rates of inpatient violence. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that almost 1 in 5 patients admitted to acute psychiatric units may commit an act of violence.

Most studies about the distribution and associated factors of involuntary admission were carried out in the western countries; however, the results may vary in different areas with different legal and sociocultural backgrounds. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the proportion and associated factors of involuntary admission in a psychiatric emergency service in Taiwan. Methods: The study cohort included patients admitted from a psychiatric emergency service over a two-year period. Demographic, psychiatric emergency service utilization, and clinical variables were compared between those who were voluntarily and involuntarily admitted to explore the associated factors of involuntary admission. Results: Among 2,777 admitted patients, 110 (4.0%) were involuntarily admitted. Police referrals and presenting problems as violence assessed by psychiatric nurses were found to be associated with involuntary admission. These patients were more likely to be involuntarily admitted during the night shift and stayed longer in the psychiatric emergency service. Conclusions: The proportion of involuntary admissions in Taiwan was in the lower range when compared to Western countries.

This study examines the prevalence of depression in a sample of Sri Lankan undergraduates, their exposure to threatening life events and the predictors of their depression. Methods: Responses of 4304 undergraduates were obtained on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and a measure of exposure to threatening life events, with binary logistic regression models used to identify the demographic and life event correlates of screening positive for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Results: PHQ-9 diagnoses of 'Major' and 'Other' depression were obtained by 9.3% and 13.5% of undergraduates, respectively. A higher likelihood of MDD was seen among those who were older and those living in hostels (compared to home), although no differences were seen between genders or those studying in different faculties. Likelihood of MDD was higher in undergraduates exposed to multiple threatening life events as well as those exposed to physical threat; family deaths; romantic break-ups; a problem with a close associate; educational difficulties; unemployment and domestic violence, and among male undergraduates harassed by another student.

1356,"© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.In non-gang populations, the degree of identification with an in-group and perceptions of out-group entitativity, the perception of an out-group as bonded or unified, are important contributors to group-based aggression or vicarious retribution. The link between these factors and group-based aggression, however, has not been examined in the context of street gangs. The current study assessed the relationship among in-group identification, perceptions of out-group entitativity, and the willingness to retaliate against members of rival groups who did not themselves attack the in-group among juvenile gang and non-gang members in London. Our results showed the predicted membership (gang/non-gang) × in-group identification × entitativity interaction. Decomposition of the three-way interaction by membership revealed a significant identification × entitativity interaction for gang, but not for non-gang members. More specifically, gang members who identify more strongly with their gang and perceived a rival group as high on entitativity were more willing to retaliate against any of them. In addition, entitativity was a significant predictor of group-based aggression after controlling for gender, in-group identification, and gang membership. Our results are consistent with socio-psychological theories of group-based aggression and support the proposal that such theories are applicable for understanding gang-related violence. Aggr.

Clinical data analysing the correlation between alcohol intoxication, age, gender and violence are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of age, gender and blood alcohol content on violent behaviour under the influence of alcohol under central European conditions. Three hundred patients admitted to the emergency department were included into this study in the time period from January 01. to December 31. 2009. The inclusion criteria were a blood alcohol content (BAC) of ≥10 mmol/l, any traumatic injury and an age ≥16 years. Violence was defined as an evitable act committed by others leading to patient's hospitalisation. The data were compared with Wilcoxon and χ2-test for proportions. The data were considered as significant if p<0,05. Predictive quality was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Independent predictors were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. The average age was 36,9±16,9 years (range: 16.84 years), 259 (86%) males and 41 (24%) females.

It identifies how psychological violence is defined, what are the behaviors it includes and excludes, and how it is incorporated in the study of partner violence. For that end, major works in this field are chronologically examined. Based on limitations identified in the second section, it is argued that despite all the attempts made, psychological partner violence is still a vague, unclear, and controversial concept.

1366,"© 2015.No population-representative US study has examined how lifetime exposure to gender-based violence (GBV) is related to a broad range of mood/anxiety and substance use disorders. The current study advances the literature by examining the relative contributions of developmental timing of earliest GBV exposure and amount of lifetime GBV exposure on risk for eight mood/anxiety and ten substance use disorders. Participants were 20,089 women from wave 2 (2004-2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions. Women reporting lifetime GBV (25%; n=5284) had 3.6 and 2.5 times the odds of meeting lifetime mood/anxiety and substance use disorder criteria, respectively. Number of types and number of incidents of GBV were associated with risk for both types of disorders in a dose-response fashion; when examined simultaneously, number of types of GBV was the stronger predictor of mood/anxiety and substance use disorders. Relative to those who first experienced GBV during adulthood, first exposure during childhood and adolescence was associated with increased risk for mood/anxiety and substance use disorders. One in four women reported lifetime GBV, which had pernicious effects on mood/anxiety and substance use disorders, particularly for women who had experienced multiple types of GBV. The GBV effect varied by developmental period of exposure. Prevention of GBV is critical to reducing its burden.

1367,"© 2015 Dorte M. Christiansen and Maj Hansen.Background: Approximately twice as many females as males are diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about why females report more PTSD symptoms than males. Prior studies have generally focused on few potential mediators at a time and have often used methods that were not ideally suited to test for mediation effects. Prior research has identified a number of individual risk factors that may contribute to sex differences in PTSD severity, although these cannot fully account for the increased symptom levels in females when examined individually. Objective: The present study is the first to systematically test the hypothesis that a combination of pre-, peri-, and posttraumatic risk factors more prevalent in females can account for sex differences in PTSD severity. Method: The study was a quasi-prospective questionnaire survey assessing PTSD and related variables in 73.3% of all Danish bank employees exposed to bank robbery during the period from April 2010 to April 2011. Participants filled out questionnaires 1 week (T1, N 450) and 6 months after the robbery (T2, N 368; 61.1% females). Mediation was examined using an analysis designed specifically to test a multiple mediator model. Results: Females reported more PTSD symptoms than males and higher levels of neuroticism, depression, physical anxiety sensitivity, peritraumatic fear, horror, and helplessness (the A2 criterion), tonic immobility, panic, dissociation, negative posttraumatic cognitions about self and the world, and feeling let down. These variables were included in the model as potential mediators. The combination of risk factors significantly mediated the association between sex and PTSD severity, accounting for 83% of the association. Conclusion: The findings suggest that females report more PTSD symptoms because they experience higher levels of associated risk factors. The results are relevant to other trauma populations and to other traumarelated psychiatric disorders more prevalent in females, such as depression and anxiety.",2015-02-25,Journal,Article,European Journal of Psychotraumatology,21100394256,106,6,Accounting for sex differences in PTSD: A multi-variable mediation model,1,true,10.3402/ejpt.v6.26068,Co-Action Publishinginfo@co-action.net,European Journal of Psychotraumatology,2015.0,62.0,6.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings suggest that females report more PTSD symptoms because they experience higher levels of associated risk factors, such as depression and anxiety.'}",1367,9536740,D.

1368,"© 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and MedicinePurpose: Girls in the child welfare system are at high risk of revictimization in adolescence. The present study compared two interventions designed to decrease revictimization in a diverse sample of adolescent child welfare–involved girls. The social learning/feminist (SL/F) intervention focused on concepts derived from social learning and feminist models of risk, such as sexism and beliefs about relationships. The risk detection/executive function (RD/EF) intervention focused on development of specific executive function abilities related to detecting and responding to risky situations/people. Methods: Participants were randomized to RD/EF (n = 67) or SL/F intervention (n = 67). A group of youth (n = 42) engaged in the research assessments only. Participants (n = 180) were assessed before intervention, immediately after intervention, 2 months after intervention, and 6 months after intervention. We examined revictimization (the presence/absence of sexual or physical assault in any relationship) over time. Results: Adolescent girls in the RD/EF condition were nearly five times less likely to report sexual revictimization compared with girls in the no-treatment group. A trend suggested that girls who participated in the SL/F intervention were 2.5 times less likely to report sexual revictimization relative to the no-treatment group. For physical revictimization, the odds of not being physically revictimized were three times greater in the SL/F condition and two times greater in the RD/EF condition compared with the no-treatment group.

Methods: We randomly assigned SB to 30 public middle schools in New York City, enrolling 117 sixth and seventh grade classes to receive a classroom, building, combined, or neither intervention. The SB classroom intervention included six sessions emphasizing the laws/consequences of DV/H, establishing boundaries and safe relationships. The SB schoolwide/building intervention included the use of school-based restraining orders, greater faculty/security presence in unsafe “hot spots” mapped by students, and posters to increase DV/H awareness and reporting. Student surveys were implemented at baseline, immediately after intervention, and 6 months after intervention. Results: At 6 months after intervention, the SB building-level intervention was associated with significant reductions in the frequency of sexual harassment (SH) perpetration and victimization; the prevalence and frequency of sexual dating violence victimization; and the frequency of total dating violence victimization and perpetration. We also had one anomalous finding that the interventions were associated with an increase in the prevalence of SH victimization. These results were consistent for girls and boys, and those with or without a history of DV/H, with the one exception for those exposed to the SB building condition who had earlier reported perpetrating SH had a significantly lower frequency of perpetrating SH at the follow-up than those without such a history.

1370,"© 2015 © 2015 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.This article questions the recommendations to revive ABC (abstain, be faithful, condomise) as a mechanism to educate people in South Africa about HIV prevention as the South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Behaviour Survey, 2012, suggests. We argue that ABC was designed as a response to a particular context which has now radically changed. In South Africa the contemporary context reflects the mass roll-out of antiretroviral treatment; significant bio-medical knowledge gains; a generalised population affected by HIV that has made sense of and embodied those diverse experiences; and a government committed to confronting the epidemic. We suggest that the situation can now be plausibly conceptualised as a complex, adaptive epidemiological landscape that could benefit from an expansion of the existing, descriptive prevention paradigm towards strategies that focus on the dynamics of transmission. We argue for this shift by proposing a theoretical framework based on complexity theory and pattern management. We interrogate one educational prevention heuristic that emphasises the importance of risk-reduction through the lens of transmission, called A-3B-4C-T. We argue that this type of approach provides expansive opportunities for people to engage with the epidemic in contextualised, innovative ways that supersede the opportunities afforded by ABC. We then suggest that framing the prevention imperative through the lens of dynamic prevention at scale opens more immediate opportunities, as well as developing a future-oriented mind-set, than the descriptive prevention parameters can facilitate. The parameters of the descriptive prevention paradigm, that maintain-and partially reinforce-the presence of ABC, do not have the flexibility required to develop the armamentarium of tools required to contribute to the management of a complex epidemiological landscape. Uncritically adhering to both the descriptive paradigm, and ABC, represents an historically dislocated form of prevention-with restrictive options for reducing the overall burden of HIV-related challenges in South Africa.",2015-01-02,Journal,Article,African Journal of AIDS Research,21304,5,14,"Reducing the overall HIV-burden in South Africa: Is reviving ABC an appropriate fit for a complex, adaptive epidemiological HIV landscape?",0,false,10.2989/16085906.2015.1016988,Routledgeinfo@tandf.co.uk,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2015.0,115.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is suggested that framing the prevention imperative through the lens of ‘dynamic prevention’ at scale opens more immediate opportunities, as well as developing a future-oriented mind-set, than the ‘descriptive prevention” parameters can facilitate.'}",1370,40463267,C.

1373,"© 2015 T. Meer and H. Combrinck.Of the range of disabilities, intellectual disabilities are often the most complex and least understood. The effects of the disability and related negative social attitudes and perceptions combine with the pernicious effects of sexism and misogyny, so that women with these kinds of disabilities are frequently and disproportionally subject to gender-based violence (GBV). This article explores the stigmatisation that renders women with intellectual disabilities more vulnerable to victimisation from the perspective of service providers in the disability and GBV sectors. The data are taken from a larger study on GBV and access to justice for women with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities undertaken in the Western Cape, Gauteng, and KwaZulu-Natal, wherein we interviewed 58 service providers at disability and GBV organisations. In the process, service provider narratives indicated that the experiences of women with intellectual disabilities, including their vulnerability to and experiences of violence, are mediated by multiple complex social perceptions and myths. According to our findings these include the general view that people with disabilities are less valuable, cultural myths and superstitions about disability, fear and shame associated with ‘disabled’ sexuality, beliefs about the lack of credibility of persons with intellectual disabilities, and the tendency of persons with disabilities to internalise negative views about themselves. These myths and perceptions are not mutually exclusive, but combine and interact in complex and compound ways, often rendering the victimisation of women with intellectual disabilities invisible, or intractable.

Women killed far fewer people than did men, which accords with studies of homicide in other times and places; but if we include in our counts (as contemporaries would have done) both infanticide and killings by means of witchcraft, we see that women were disproportionately represented amongst those deemed to have committed murder rather than the less serious crime of manslaughter. Early modern responses to homicide, and thus the long-lived laws that grew from them and the bodies of evidence upon which we rely, had embedded within them humoural understandings of male and female difference that were premised on variations in vital heat.

1385,"© 2015, Edita Socidrogalcohol. All rights reserved.Introduction. Cocaine abuse, as well as prenatal exposure to cocaine, could be key factors in the expression of violent behaviour. Neuropsychological impairments, sex differences and the concurrent abuse of cocaine and alcohol have been suggested as facilitation mechanisms. Aims. To review and recapitulate the results obtained on the relationship between neuropsychological deficits due to cocaine abuse and/or prenatal exposure and the expression of violence. Furthermore, we analyze the roles of sex, concurrent alcohol abuse and possible brain damage as risk markers in this relationship. Development. The scientific literature was reviewed using Google Scholar, PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline and ISI Web of Knowledge. Conclusions. Cocaine facilitates the expression of violence due to neuropsychological deficits in emotional decoding, abstract reasoning and inhibitory control, as well as in mnemonic and verbal skills, and such impairments might also explain problems in decisionmaking. Both the deficits and the expression of violence appear to be more pronounced in men than in women. However, despite the fact that the combination of cocaine and alcohol use may increase the risk of violent reactions, the deficits would not be greater than those resulting from the separate use of each substance. The impairments might be caused by functional abnormalities of certain regions of the frontal (especially the prefrontal) and parietal lobes and some subcortical structures, such as the amygdala. All of this would provide a basis for the development of intervention strategies focusing on these cognitive domains.",2015-01-01,Journal,Review,Adicciones,24767,12,27,Neuropsychological impairments associated with the relation between cocaine abuse and violence: Neurological facilitation mechanisms Déficits neuropsicológicos asociados a la relación entre abuso de cocaína y violencia: Mecanismos neuronales facilitadores,1,true,10.20882/adicciones.194,"Edita SocidrogalcoholC/.

1386,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.As the number of females served by the juvenile justice system in the United States continues to grow, both in absolute terms and relative to the number of males, it is important to understand both the general and specific characteristics of delinquent girls and boys regarding their patterns of offending and risk variables. Using systematic random sampling, 20% of all admittees to the state-run juvenile detention centers in the state of Connecticut, USA, were included in a chart review study, forming a sample (n. =. 371, 30.2% girls, age range 11-19. years; mean age. =. 14.45, sd. =. 1.05) that was analyzed for gender differences with regard to characteristics of offenses. These characteristics were examined for their potential associations with indicators of risk that are routinely collected at admission to detention. Findings indicate a complex set of associations between indicators of offense and risk, highlighting the importance not only of gender, but also of racial/ethnic differences, whose modulating effects appear to be important in understanding these associations. Specifically, girls in detention are characterized by a number of dimensions, some of which align with those for boys and some that are more gender-specific. For example, girls, as a group, demonstrated higher levels of substance abuse, suicide ideation, victimization, and mental-health variability, but these higher scores are more characteristic of girls from minority backgrounds.

1390,"© The Author(s) 2014.Colleges and universities are high-risk settings for sexual and relationship violence. To address these problems, institutions of higher education have implemented prevention programs, many of which train students as potential bystanders who can step in to help diffuse risky situations, identify and challenge perpetrators, and assist victims. The impact of bystander sexual and relationship violence prevention programs on long-term behavior of bystanders has remained a key unanswered question for those who seek to offer the most effective programs as well as for policy makers. In this study, the researchers experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of the Bringing in the Bystander® in-person program. Participants were 948 1st-year college students of whom 47.8% were women and 85.2% identified as White (15% also identified as Hispanic in a separate question) between the ages of 18 and 24 at two universities (one a rural, primarily residential campus and the other an urban, highly commuter campus) in the northeastern United States. To date, this is the first study to have found positive behavior changes as long-lasting as 1 year following an educational workshop focusing on engaging bystanders in preventing sexual and relationship violence. Even so, many questions remain to be answered about prevention and intervention of this type. More prospective research is needed on bystander-focused prevention of these forms of violence to help understand and better predict the complicated relationships both between and among the attitudes and behaviors related to preventing sexual and relationship violence.

Identifying who is most vulnerable for this negative outcome can inform the development of intervention practices addressing this problem. The two goals of this study were to assess variations in the prevalence of dating violence across different measures of sexual minority status (e.g., sexual minority identity or same-sex sexual behavior), and to assess whether this association was mediated by bullying, the number of sexual partners, binge drinking or aggressive behaviors. These goals were assessed by employing the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 12,984), a regionally representative sample of youth ages 14–18. In this sample, a total of 540 girls and 323 boys reported a non-heterosexual identity, and 429 girls and 230 boys reported having had one or more same-sex sexual partners. The results generally supported a higher prevalence of dating violence among sexual minority youth.

1399,"© Pani et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.Background: The relationship between substance use disorders and psychiatric pathology is still an open question. The main aim of the present study was to verify whether the five psychopathological dimensions identified through the SCL-90 tool in a previous study carried out on patients with heroin addiction entering an outpatient opioid agonist treatment (OAT) were also observable in those entering a residential treatment community (TC). Further aims were to look at differences in the psychopathological profiles of patients entering a TC versus an OAT treatment and at the correlation between gender and the observed psychopathology. Methods: A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the results of SCL-90 filled by 1,195 patients with heroin dependence entering TC treatment. It replicates the extraction method previously used on 1,055 OAT patients with heroin addiction by using a principal component factor analysis (PCA). The association between the kind of treatment received (TC or OAT), gender, and the psychopathological dimensions was assessed through logistic regression and general linear model (GLM) analysis. Results: The PCA carried out on the SCL-90 results of patients entering a TC yielded a five-factor solution, confirming the same dimensions observed in patients entering an OAT: 'worthlessness and being trapped', 'somatization', 'sensitivity-psychoticism', 'panic anxiety', and 'violence-suicide'. The logistic regression analysis showed a statistically significant association between 'somatization' and 'violence-suicide' severity score and OAT. GLM analysis showed that psychopathological factorial scores for 'worthlessness-being trapped', 'somatic symptoms', and 'panic anxiety' dimensions were more severe in OAT vs TC male patients and in TC vs OAT female ones. 'Violence suicide' followed the same severity pattern for males, but did not differ in TC vs OAT females, while 'sensitivity-psychoticism' did not differ in OAT vs TC patients. The five dimensions did not differ in OAT males vs females. Conclusions: Our research appears to confirm the existence of a specific aggregation of psychological/psychiatric features within the category of individuals with heroin addiction. It also shows a correlation between the dominant psychopathological subgroup and the assignment to TC versus OAT. Further research is needed to clarify the differences between the five psychopathological subgroups and their determinants.",2014-11-18,Journal,Article,Annals of General Psychiatry,130125,37,13,Psychopathological symptoms of patients with heroin addiction entering opioid agonist or therapeutic community treatment,1,true,10.1186/s12991-014-0035-x,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,Annals of General Psychiatry,2014.0,86.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This research appears to confirm the existence of a specific aggregation of psychological/psychiatric features within the category of individuals with heroin addiction.'}",1399,13940834,P.

The present study examines the uniquely gendered pathways linking generational status, family functioning, and violence.Methods:Using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and overdispersed Poisson regression, the authors examine predictors of family functioning and violence using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods study.Results:Generational status influences family dynamics for both males and females, although the strength and significance of the effects vary by gender. For boys, generational status is a significant predictor of conflict and harsh parenting, net of other factors; for girls, it is associated with religiosity and conflict. Further, family processes attenuate the relationship between generational status and violence for girls only, implying alternative mechanisms for boys.Conclusions:The associations among immigrant generational status, family functioning, and violence differ for males and females, which has implications for intervention strategies aimed at promoting the well-being of immigrant youth.

1401,"© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.This study examines the risk factors of re-entry for 1,750 child protection cases in Singapore using a cumulative ecological-transactional risk model. Using administrative data, the present study found that the overall percentage of Child Protection Service (CPS) re-entry in Singapore is 10.5% based on 1,750 cases, with a range from 3.9% (within 1 year) to 16.5% (within 8 years after case closure). One quarter of the re-entry cases were observed to occur within 9 months from case closure. Seventeen risk factors, as identified from the extant literature, were tested for their utility to predict CPS re-entry in this study using a series of Cox regression analyses. A final list of seven risk factors (i.e., children's age at entry, case type, case closure result, duration of case, household income, family size, and mother's employment status) was used to create a cumulative risk score. The results supported the cumulative risk model in that higher risk score is related to higher risk of CPS re-entry. Understanding the prevalence of CPS re-entry and the risk factors associated with re-entry is the key to informing practice and policy in a culturally relevant way.

1402,"© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Previous research has shown that violent video games can increase aggression in players immediately after they play. The present research examines the effects of one subtle cue within violent video games that might moderate these effects-whether the avatar is male or female. One common stereotype is that males are more aggressive than females. Thus, playing a violent video game as a male avatar, compared to a female avatar, should be more likely to prime aggressive thoughts and inclinations in players and lead to more aggressive behavior afterwards. Male and female university students (N=242) were randomly assigned to play a violent video game as a male or female avatar. After gameplay, participants gave an ostensible partner who hated spicy food hot sauce to eat. The amount of hot sauce given was used to measure aggression. Consistent with priming theory, results showed that both male and female participants who played a violent game as a male avatar behaved more aggressively afterwards than those who played as female avatar. The priming effects of the male avatar were somewhat stronger for male participants than for female participants, suggesting that male participants identified more with the male avatar than did the female participants. These results are particularly noteworthy because they are consistent with another recent experiment showing that playing a violent game as an avatar with a different stereotypically aggressive attribute (black skin color) stimulates more aggression than playing as an avatar without the stereotypically aggressive attribute (Yang et al., 2014, Social Psychological and Personality Science).",2014-11-01,Journal,Article,Aggressive Behavior,29452,17,40,Effects of playing a violent video game as male versus female avatar on subsequent aggression in male and female players,2,,10.1002/ab.21551,Wiley-Liss Inc.,Aggressive Behavior,2014.0,41.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results showed that both male and female participants who played a violent game as a male avatar behaved more aggressively afterwards than those who played as female avatar, suggesting that male participants identified more with the male avatar than did the female participants.'}",1402,50146946,Grace S.

On hand of statistical tests, various epidemiological correlations regarding the pathogenic pathways and types of traumatic injuries were established. Results and discussion. The trauma patterns that can be identified throughout a complete general and oro-dental examination performed by a trained DMD or a forensic dentist are multiple. They are significantly associated with multiple factors like age or sex – as a basis of optimal prevention. Conclusions. Through their frequency, polymorphism and potential dental and aesthetic disabilities, the orofacial trauma patterns should be a subject of concern for all parties involved. Optimal prevention and treatment are crucial for the future physical and psychological development of the child.",2014-09-01,Journal,Article,Romanian Journal of Legal Medicine,27796,0,22,Orofacial trauma patterns in children victims of violence and abuse,0,false,10.4323/rjlm.2014.187,Romanian Legal Medicine Society,,2014.0,22.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The trauma patterns that can be identified throughout a complete general and oro-dental examination performed by a trained DMD or a forensic dentist are multiple and significantly associated with multiple factors like age or sex - as a basis of optimal prevention.'}",1414,39979010,D.

1415,"© 2014 Romanian Society of Legal Medicine.It is generally true that the incarcerated population is one of the most vulnerable groups in almost every country. Although plenty of evidence on the health and deaths of the incarcerated population have been studied in different countries, there is still little availability of related information in China. Focusing on the Hunan province in the south central part of China, this paper aims to evaluate the characteristics of forensic pathology and epidemiology of the controversial deaths in the incarcerated population in China. During the evaluation process we have reviewed 61 cases which were autopsied by the Hunan Xiangya Judicial Identification Center from 2006 to 2013. The data are collected and analyzed from the point of view of demographics variables (age, gender, ethnicity and education level) and incarceration-related variables (number of incarcerations, place of imprisonment, cause of controversy and cause of death). The majority of the 61 cases are male (91.8%), and the leading age (63.8%)is within 31 to 50 years old. All the deceased are ethnic Han and most of them (75.5%) failed to complete the compulsory 9-year education in China. Jail (40.9%) and prison (32.8%) are the leading places where the deaths occur. The number of deaths during the study period exhibits fluctuations from year to year, with a slight decreasing trend. Violence-related death suspected by families and prosecutors constitutes 62.3% and has become the primary causes for disputes. Overall, 80.3% of deaths are due to illnesses, out of which 39.4% died of acute death, 26.2% of chronic diseases and 14.7% of infectious diseases; a cause of death not related to illness accounts for 19.7% of the total. The most frequent cause of death is sudden cardiac arrest (37.8%) in acute death; the cardiovascular disease (9.9%) is the most common cause of death in chronic diseases and suicide cases account for 14.9%, being the leading cause of non-illness related cases. Among the 61 controversial deaths reviewed in this paper, the causes of death are correlated with a diversity of factors.

1416,"© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.A social multipliereffect is a social interaction in which the behavior of a person in a social network varies with the normative behavior of others in the network, also known as an endogenous interaction. Policies and intervention efforts can harness social multiplier effects because, in theory, interventions on a subset of individuals will have “spillover effects” on other individuals in the network. This study investigates potential social multiplier effects for violence in middle schools, and whether there is evidence for a social multiplier effect transmitted from girls to boys. Three years of longitudinal data (2003–2005) from Project Northland Chicago were used to investigate this question, with a sample consisting of youth in Grades 6 through 8 in 61 Chicago Public Schools (N = 4,233 at Grade 6, N = 3,771 at Grade 7, and N = 3,793 at Grade 8). The sample was 49.3 % female, and primarily African American (41.9 %) and Latino/a (28.7 %), with smaller proportions of whites (12.9 %), Asians (5.2 %) and other ethnicities. Results from two sets of regression models estimating the effects of 20th (low), 50th (average), and 80th (high) percentile scores for girls and boys on levels of violence in each gender group revealed evidence for social multiplier effects. Specifically, boys and girls were both influenced by social multiplier effects within their own gender group, and boys were also affected by normative violence scores among girls, typically those of the best-behaved (20th percentile) girls. The finding that girls may have positive social influence on boys’ levels of violent behavior extends prior findings of beneficial social effects of girls on boys in the domains of education and risky driving. Further, this social normative effect presents a potential opportunity to improve school-based intervention efforts for reducing violence among youth by leveraging girls as carriers of a social multiplier effect for reduced violence in the middle school environmental context, particularly among boys, who are at greater risk.",2014-09-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,25680,13,43,Cross-Gender Social Normative Effects for Violence in Middle School: Do Girls Carry a Social Multiplier Effect for At-Risk Boys?,2,,10.1007/s10964-014-0104-0,Springer New York LLCbarbara.b.bertram@gsk.com,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,2014.0,103.0,0.0,,1416,5848179,L.

1419,"Introduction. Gender-based violence (GBV) is prevalent among, though not specific to, conflict affected populations and related to multifarious levels of vulnerability of conflict and displacement. Colombia has been marked with decades of conflict, with an estimated 5.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and ongoing violence. We conducted qualitative research to understand the contexts of conflict, displacement and dynamics with GBV. This as part of a multi-phase, mixed method study, in collaboration with UNHCR, to develop a screening tool to confidentially identify cases of GBV for referral among IDP women who were survivors of GBV. Methods. Qualitative research was used to identify the range of GBV, perpetrators, contexts in conflict and displacement, barriers to reporting and service uptake, as well as to understand experiences of service providers. Thirty-five female IDPs, aged 18 years and older, who self-identified as survivors of GBV were enrolled for in-depth interviews in San Jose de Guaviare and Quibdo, Colombia in June 2012. Thirty-one service providers participated in six focus group discussions and four interviews across these sites. Results: Survivors described a range of GBV across conflict and displacement settings. Armed actors in conflict settings perpetrated threats of violence and harm to family members, child recruitment, and, to a lesser degree, rape and forced abortion. Opportunistic violence, including abduction, rape, and few accounts of trafficking were more commonly reported to occur in the displacement setting, often perpetrated by unknown individuals. Intrafamilial violence, intimate partner violence, including physical and sexual violence and reproductive control were salient across settings and may be exacerbated by conflict and displacement. Barriers to reporting and services seeking were reported by survivors and providers alike. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for early identification of GBV cases, with emphasis on confidential approaches and active engagement of survivors in available, quality services. Such efforts may facilitate achievement of the goals of new Colombian laws, which seek to prevent and respond to GBV, including in conflict settings. Ongoing conflict and generalized GBV in displacement, as well as among the wider population, suggests a need to create sustainable solutions that are accessible to both IDPs and general populations. © 2014 Wirtz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014-07-11,Journal,Article,Conflict and Health,19900191754,65,8,Gender-based violence in conflict and displacement: Qualitative findings from displaced women in Colombia,1,true,10.1186/1752-1505-8-10,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,Conflict and Health,2014.0,58.0,8.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The need for early identification of GBV cases is highlighted, with emphasis on confidential approaches and active engagement of survivors in available, quality services, to facilitate achievement of the goals of new Colombian laws.'}",1419,27680748,A.

1420,"Background: Several biological, behavioural, and structural risk factors place female sex workers (FSWs) at heightened risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and other adverse sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. FSW projects in many settings have demonstrated effective ways of altering this risk, improving the health and wellbeing of these women. Yet the optimum delivery model of FSW projects in Africa is unclear. This systematic review describes intervention packages, service-delivery models, and extent of government involvement in these services in Africa.Methods: On 22 November 2012, we searched Web of Science and MEDLINE, without date restrictions, for studies describing clinical and non-clinical facility-based SRH prevention and care services for FSWs in low- and middle-income countries in Africa. We also identified articles in key non-indexed journals and on websites of international organizations. A single reviewer screened titles and abstracts, and extracted data from articles using standardised tools.Results: We located 149 articles, which described 54 projects. Most were localised and small-sca≤ focused on research activities (rather than on large-scale service delivery); operated with little coordination, either nationally or regionally; and had scanty government support (instead a range of international donors generally funded services). Almost all sites only addressed HIV prevention and STIs. Most services distributed male condoms, but only 10% provided female condoms. HIV services mainly encompassed HIV counselling and testing; few offered HIV care and treatment such as CD4 testing or antiretroviral therapy (ART). While STI services were more comprehensive, periodic presumptive treatment was only provided in 11 instances. Services often ignored broader SRH needs such as family planning, cervical cancer screening, and gender-based violence services.Conclusions: Sex work programmes in Africa have limited coverage and a narrow scope of services and are poorly coordinated with broader HIV and SRH services. To improve FSWs' health and reduce onward HIV transmission, access to ART needs to be addressed urgently. Nevertheless, HIV prevention should remain the mainstay of services. Service delivery models that integrate broader SRH services and address structural risk factors are much needed.

1421,"© 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.Background: The World Health Organization's (WHO's) Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework is an holistic, settings-based approach to promoting health and educational attainment in school. The effectiveness of this approach has not been previously rigorously reviewed. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of the Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework in improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement. Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases in January 2011 and again in March and April 2013: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Campbell Library, ASSIA, BiblioMap, CAB Abstracts, IBSS, Social Science Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, TRoPHI, Global Health Database, SIGLE, Australian Education Index, British Education Index, Education Resources Information Centre, Database of Education Research, Dissertation Express, Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current controlled trials, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched relevant websites, handsearched reference lists, and used citation tracking to identify other relevant articles. Selection criteria: We included cluster-randomised controlled trials where randomisation took place at the level of school, district or other geographical area. Participants were children and young people aged four to 18 years, attending schools or colleges. In this review, we define HPS interventions as comprising the following three elements: input to the curriculum; changes to the school's ethos or environment or both; and engagement with families or communities, or both. We compared this intervention against schools that implemented either no intervention or continued with their usual practice, or any programme that included just one or two of the above mentioned HPS elements. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors identified relevant trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in the trials. We grouped different types of interventions according to the health topic targeted or the approach used, or both. Where data permitted, we performed random-effects meta-analyses to provide a summary of results across studies. Main results: We included 67 eligible cluster trials, randomising 1443 schools or districts. This is made up of 1345 schools and 98 districts. The studies tackled a range of health issues: physical activity (4), nutrition (12), physical activity and nutrition combined (18), bullying (7), tobacco (5), alcohol (2), sexual health (2), violence (2), mental health (2), hand-washing (2), multiple risk behaviours (7), cycle-helmet use (1), eating disorders (1), sun protection (1), and oral health (1). The quality of evidence overall was low to moderate as determined by the GRADE approach. 'Risk of bias' assessments identified methodological limitations, including heavy reliance on self-reported data and high attrition rates for some studies. In addition, there was a lack of long-term follow-up data for most studies. We found positive effects for some interventions for: body mass index (BMI), physical activity, physical fitness, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, and being bullied. Intervention effects were generally small but have the potential to produce public health benefits at the population level. We found little evidence of effectiveness for standardised body mass index (zBMI) and no evidence of effectiveness for fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, mental health, violence and bullying others; however, only a small number of studies focused on these latter outcomes. It was not possible to meta-analyse data on other health outcomes due to lack of data. Few studies provided details on adverse events or outcomes related to the interventions. In addition, few studies included any academic, attendance or school-related outcomes. We therefore cannot draw any clear conclusions as to the effectiveness of this approach for improving academic achievement. Authors' conclusions: The results of this review provide evidence for the effectiveness of some interventions based on the HPS framework for improving certain health outcomes but not others. More well-designed research is required to establish the effectiveness of this approach for other health topics and academic achievement.",2014-04-16,Journal,Review,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,29775,400,2014,The WHO Health Promoting School framework for improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement,2,,10.1002/14651858.CD008958.pub2,"John Wiley and Sons LtdSouthern GateChichester, West SussexPO19 8SQvgorayska@wiley.com",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2014.0,446.0,18.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The results of this review provide evidence for the effectiveness of some interventions based on the Health Promoting Schools framework for improving certain health outcomes but not others; however, there was a lack of long-term follow-up data for most studies.'}",1421,31829363,R.

1422,"In Hindu cosmology and life-worlds, women are described as being Shaktis, personifications of cosmic feminine power or shakti. However, the shakti of Hindu widows of all ages, because it is no longer directed into reproduction, is feared as being rampant, likely to incur disgrace, polluting and dangerous. Hence, widows, deemed culpable of having failed in their primary wifely duty of protecting and preserving the health and lives of their husbands, are often ill-treated in an attempt to weaken and disarm the reservoir of power that they continue to embody. This article focuses on a case study of a young widow, Savitri, who strove to support her children and maintain her self-regard in the face of frequently-violent hostility from her neighbours due to her creative yet subversive circumvention of the religio-cultural prescriptions and proscriptions her widow status demanded.

CTC has been found to have sustained effects on cigarette use and delinquent and violent behaviors in grade 10 in a panel of 4,407 students followed from fifth grade in a community randomized trial. It is important to test variation in the effects of this prevention system designed to be universal to understand for whom it is most effective and whether it fails to produce change or leads to iatrogenic effects for certain categories of individuals. The present study examined variation in the sustained effects of CTC on tenth-grade cigarette use and delinquent and violent behaviors. Interaction analyses suggest that the effect of CTC did not differ between those who had high levels of community-targeted risk factors at baseline or had already engaged in substance use, delinquency, or violence at baseline versus those who had not.

1424,"Background: In 2002, the WHO declared interpersonal violence to be a leading public health problem. Previous research demonstrates that urban spaces with a high incidence of violent trauma (hotspots) correlate with features of built environment and social determinants. However, there are few studies that analyse injury data across the axes of both space and time to characterise injury-environment relationships. This paper describes a spatiotemporal analysis of violent injuries in Vancouver, Canada, from 2001 to 2008. Methods: Using geographic information systems, 575 violent trauma incidents were mapped and analysed using kernel density estimation to identify hotspot locations. Patterns between space, time, victim age and sex and mechanism of injury were investigated with an exploratory approach. Results: Several patterns in space and time were identified and described, corresponding to distinct neighbourhood characteristics. Violent trauma hotspots were most prevalent in Vancouver's nightclub district on Friday and Saturday nights, with higher rates in the most socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods. Victim sex, age and mechanism of injury also formed strong patterns. Three neighbourhood profiles are presented using the dual axis of space/time to describe the hotspot environments. Conclusions: This work posits the value of exploratory spatial data analysis using geographic information systems in trauma epidemiology studies and further suggests that using both space and time concurrently to understand urban environmental correlates of injury provides a more granular or higher resolution picture of risk.

Men's poor engagement in health-promoting activities has been attributed to the socially constructed male gender identity.

While psychiatric distress has been associated with suicidal behaviour and related self-harm, very little research has examined the role of depression in shaping adolescent injury. This study examines the association of elevated depressive symptoms with injury, including total number of injuries and injury type. Gender differences are also considered. Methods. Data were drawn in 2010-11 from a representative sample of 2,989 high school students (14 to18 years of age) from Nova Scotia, Canada. Self-reported injury outcomes were examined using the 17-item Adolescent Injury Checklist, which captures past six-month injuries. Elevated depressive symptoms were assessed using the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Associations of elevated depressive symptoms with total number of injuries were estimated with negative binomial regression, while associations with specific injury types were estimated with logistic regression. Analyses were conducted in 2012. Results: Adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms experienced a 40% increase in the total number of injury events occurring in the past six months. The association of elevated depressive symptoms with injury was consistent across injury type; violence-related (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.03), transport-related (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.13), and unintentional injuries (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.27). Gender differences were also observed. Conclusion: Elevated depressive symptoms play a role in shaping adolescent injury. Interventions aimed at reducing adolescent injury should look to minimize psychosocial antecedents, such as poor mental health, that put adolescents at an elevated risk. © 2014 Asbridge et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014-02-21,Journal,Article,BMC Public Health,19621,36,14,"Elevated depressive symptoms and adolescent injury: Examining associations by injury frequency, injury type, and gender",1,true,10.1186/1471-2458-14-190,BioMed Central Ltd.34 - 42 Cleveland StreetLondonW1T 4LB,BMC Public Health,2014.0,77.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Interventions aimed at reducing adolescent injury should look to minimize psychosocial antecedents, such as poor mental health, that put adolescents at an elevated risk of injury.'}",1426,6969691,M.

1427,"© 2014 Rada.Background: Domestic violence is a public health problem with negative consequences. We aimed to determine the prevalence of violence between parents and by parents against children, types of intimate partner violence against women, the intergenerational transmission of violence, and to identify a profile of beliefs and judgements regarding violent behaviour. Methods: The data used for this article were sourced from three cross-sectional studies performed in Romania in 2009-2011. We sampled 869 respondents (male and female) with a homogenous distribution between environment, gender, educational level, and age group (18 to 75). From a 96-item questionnaire regarding family and reproductive health, this article refers to four items: (1) feelings relating to the family in which they were raised; (2) whether they witnessed violence between parents or were victims of violence by parents or other family members during childhood or the teenage years; (3) opinions relating to 10 statements on violence from Maudsley Violence Questionnaire; (4) the manifestation of psychological, emotional, and sexual abuse from the partner in the family of procreation (FOP). The data were analysed by Pearson chi-square tests and latent class analysis. Results: During childhood, 35% of respondents witnessed parental violence and 53.7% were victims of family violence. Psychological abuse by men against women was the most common type of violence reported in the FOP (45.1%). Violence in childhood and adolescence correlated with the perception of the family of origin as a hostile environment and of violence against women as a corrective measure, and that insults, swearing, and humiliation by their partner within the FOP is acceptable (p < 0.05). A profile of beliefs and judgements about violent behaviour indicated that the Impulsive reactive cluster is represented by men in rural areas, and by subjects who witnessed parental violence or were victims of violence during childhood (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In Romania, the use of violence as a form of discipline or instruction of children and women remains a significant problem, with a higher rate of intimate partner violence than in other developed countries. Furthermore, implementing intervention mechanisms for psychological abuse is urgently required, as are education and intervention in high-risk populations.",2014-02-07,Journal,Article,BMC Public Health,19621,30,14,"Violence against women by male partners and against children within the family: Prevalence, associated factors, and intergenerational transmission in Romania, a cross-sectional study",1,true,10.1186/1471-2458-14-129,BioMed Central Ltd.info@biomedcentral.com,BMC Public Health,2014.0,86.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'In Romania, the use of violence as a form of discipline or instruction of children and women remains a significant problem, with a higher rate of intimate partner violence than in other developed countries.'}",1427,5054768,C.

1429,"Science and technology studies can help to unveil invisible modes of power that are embedded in the ways conflicts are known, debated, and resolved. Legal forms of adjudication, reporting systems used by international commissions, and data gathering on the part of governmental and nongovernmental agencies shape how conflicts are fought out on the ground and in policy arenas. Assumptions about evidence, categorization, adjudication, and measurement privilege certain forms of suffering over others, even as they omit phenomena that defy categorization. Using two examples-a global survey of violence against women and a U.S. government initiative to defer the deportation of certain undocumented immigrants-we bring insights from science and technology studies to bear on sociolegal phenomena. In so doing, we highlight tensions between measurement and invention, visibility and invisibility, and objectivity and discretion that are intrinsic to new forms of governance. We thus examine what measurement initiates and precludes, the reactive and proactive nature of technologies, and how new practices reproduce established techniques. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.",2014-02-01,Journal,Article,American Ethnologist,78019,48,41,"Technologies of truth in the anthropology of conflict: AES/APLA Presidential Address, 2013",0,false,10.1111/amet.12055,,,2014.0,35.0,0.0,,1429,83179362,S.

As self-proclaimed carriers of traditional Chinese culture, they worked arduously to replicate whatever they considered authentic Chinese through a narrow interpretation of the Confucian moral tenets in daily life.

1432,"© 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.Over the past thirty years the combined forces of research, victim advocacy, and litigation have changed public policy regarding domestic violence (DV) from a neglected “family problem” to a problem of significant concern for most criminal justice agencies (Fagan, 1996). Perhaps the most obvious change has been in law enforcement. Jurisdictions across the country have passed legislation that either encourages or requires police make an arrest when an assault has occurred between intimate partners (Miller, 1998; Sherman and Cohn, 1989). As might be expected, these laws have led to dramatic increases in the number of suspects taken into police custody (Mignon and Holmes, 1995; Victim Services Agency, 1989). Prosecutors also have changed their practices for dealing with DV in recent years. Whereas previously fewer than 10% of detained suspects were charged (e.g., Ford, 1993; Rauma, 1984; Schmidt and Steury, 1989; Sherman, 1992), prosecutors in some jurisdictions now pursue charges against the majority of defendants (Henning and Feder, in press). These two factors, increased arrests and prosecution, have resulted in significant strains on agencies interacting with DV offenders (e.g., police, pretrial services, prosecutors, judges, public defenders, probation). Moreover, many of these agencies have been forced to manage this increased caseload with fewer and fewer resources. As a result, criminal justice agencies are increasingly confronted with the task of prioritizing cases; they must identify certain DV cases that require an in-tensive response while others receive secondary attention or no intervention at all (Kropp, 2004; Roehl and Guertin, 2000).",2014-01-01,Book,Book Chapter,Women Who Perpetrate Relationship Violence: Moving Beyond Political Correctness,21100975299,0,41,Investigating intersections between gender and intimate partner violence recidivism,0,false,10.4324/9781315864419-11,Taylor and Francis,,,,,,1432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1433,"© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.This chapter describes the sociohistoric context of Korean families and the policymaking process of family policy in South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea, Korea hereafter). Until very recently, Korean families, influenced by Confucianism, have been the primary safety net and care providers with little or no assistance from the government. Recent demographic changes including low fertility, an increasingly aging population, a decrease in marriage, and an increase in divorce and transnational marriages have all contributed to social problems which need a more comprehensive and universal family policy. Major amendments to the marriage law in the Civil Law have eliminated a traditional patriarchal headship system of the family and provided equal opportunity for male and female household headship. This law has also been amended to require divorcing couples to have a period of consideration and to come to a financial settlement for child support. In addition, there have been significant improvements in the family-work balance policy and elderly policy. The newly legislated Framework Act on Healthy Families and the Multicultural Family Support Act provide strength-based and preventive family programs and services to families. Special services for families at risk have been expanded to include low-income families, single parents, and families who have members with special needs or who struggle with domestic violence. Based on these achievements, we can conclude that significant progress in family policy has been made during the last 10 years in Korea. Nevertheless, family policy should continue to develop and be more carefully designed and implemented to encourage men to be more engaged in family life and to shift the strong Korean work-oriented culture to a more family-oriented culture. Furthermore, an evidence-based policy should be sought to encourage positive effects and outcomes.",2014-01-01,Book,Book Chapter,Handbook of Family Policies Across the Globe,21100824927,9,,"Family policy in South Korea: Development, implementation, and evaluation",0,false,10.1007/978-1-4614-6771-7_20,Springer New York,,2014.0,20.0,4.0,,1433,38219910,Meejung Chin,81685425,Jaerim Lee,47090295,Soyoung Lee,66876349,Seohee Son,77211861,M.

1434,"© 2014. The Authors.Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common and serious public health concern, particularly in South Africa, but it is not well managed in primary care. Aim: This review aims to summarise the current state of knowledge regarding health sector-based interventions for IPV, their integration into health systems and services and the perspectives of service users and healthcare workers on IPV care, focusing on the South African context. Method: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched between January 2012 and May 2014. All types of study design were included, critically appraised and summarised. Results: Exposure to IPV leads to wide-ranging and serious health effects. There is sufficient evidence that intervening in IPV in primary care can improve outcomes. Women who have experienced IPV have described an appropriate response by healthcare providers to be non-judgmental, understanding and empathetic. IPV interventions that are complex, comprehensive and utilise systems-wide approaches have been most effective, but system- and society-level barriers hamper implementation. Gender inequities should not be overlooked when responding to IPV. Conclusion: Further evaluations of health sector responses to IPV are needed, in order to assist health services to determine the most appropriate models of care, how these can be integrated into current systems and how they can be supported in managing IPV. The need for this research should not prevent health services and healthcare providers from implementing IPV care, but rather should guide the development of rigorous contextually-appropriate evaluations.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,African Journal of Primary Health Care and Family Medicine,21100203104,15,6,Health sector responses to intimate partner violence: A literature review,1,true,10.4102/phcfm.v6i1.712,AOSIS OpenJournals Publishing AOSIS (Pty) Ltdpublishing@aosis.co.za,African Journal of Primary Health Care & Family Medicine,2014.0,90.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Further evaluations of health sector responses to IPV are needed, in order to assist health services to determine the most appropriate models of care, how these can be integrated into current systems and how they can be supported in managing IPV.'}",1434,33284929,Kate Rees,3808765,V.

1435,"Copyright 2014 by the article author(s).Introduction: Technology-based interventions offer an opportunity to address high-risk behaviors in the emergency department (ED). Prior studies suggest behavioral health strategies are more effective when gender differences are considered. However, the role of gender in ED patient preferences for technology-based interventions has not been examined. The objective was to assess whether patient preferences for technology-based interventions varies by gender. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from a systematic survey of adult (≥18 years of age), English-speaking patients in a large urban academic ED. Subjects were randomly selected during a purposive sample of shifts. The iPad survey included questions on access to technology, preferences for receiving health information, and demographics. We defined ""technology-based"" as web, text message, e-mail, social networking, or DVD; ""non-technology-based"" was defined as in-person, written materials, or landline. We calculated descriptive statistics and used univariate tests to compare men and women. Gender-stratified multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine associations between other demographic factors (age, race, ethnicity, income) and technology-based preferences for information on specific risky behaviors. Results: Of 417 participants, 45.1% were male. There were no significant demographic differences between men and women. Women were more likely to use computers (90.8% versus 81.9%; p=0.03), Internet (66.8% versus 59.0%; p=0.03), and social networks (53.3% versus 42.6%; p=0.01). 89% of men and 90% of women preferred technology-based formats for at least type of health information; interest in technology-based for individual health topics did not vary by gender. Concern about confidentiality was the most common barrier to technology-based use for both genders. Multivariate analysis showed that for smoking, depression, drug/alcohol use, and injury prevention, gender modified the relationship between other demographic factors and preference for technology-based health information; e.g., older age decreases interest in technology-based information for smoking cessation in women but not in men (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99 versus aOR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03). Conclusion: Our findings suggest ED patients' gender may affect technology preferences.

1440,"© 2014, Institute for Educational Research. All rights reserved.The main aim of this study was to explore the latent structure of violence and victimisation based on the factor analysis of the Peer Violence and Victimisation Questionnaire (PVVQ), as well as to examine the correlates of violence and victimisation. The sample included 649 secondary school students (61.8% male) from the urban area. Besides the PVVQ, the Aggressiveness questionnaire AVDH was administered. Based on parallel analysis, three factors were extracted in the violence domain, as well as in the victimisation domain of the PVVQ. The factors were interpreted as a physical, verbal and relational form of violence and victimisation, which is in line with common classifications. The correlations of those forms with the aggressiveness dimensions were positive. The relationships with gender, school grade and school achievement referred to the importance of interaction effects between the mentioned characteristics of students and the tendency towards violence or being exposed to it.

1443,"Little is known about the prevalence and predictors of mental disorders among injured emergency center (EC) patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Patients presenting with either an intentional or unintentional injury were recruited (N = 200). Mental health, injury, and psychological trauma histories were assessed. Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were conducted, and predictors of current mental disorder were identified. Diagnostic criteria for a current mental disorder, including substance use disorders, were met by 59.5% of the participants. Compared with those with an unintentional injury, the intentionally injured participants were more likely to be diagnosed with a current mental disorder (66.9% vs. 48.8%, p = .01). High frequencies of previous intentional injuries predicted for current mental disorder (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98), whereas male gender and witnessed community violence predicted substance use disorder diagnoses. The findings indicate that injured EC patients, particularly those with intentional injuries, are at risk for mental disorders.

1444,"This article examines the construction of masculinities in social interaction through in-depth interviews with trans men living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Interviewees' concerns for safety, particularly the threat of violence from other men, shaped their masculine practices, which led some men to practice defensive masculinities and, for others, constrained their ability to practice transformative masculinities. Respondents' concerns for safety, and their masculine practices, changed according to variation in transition, physical location, audience, and their physical stature. These findings have implications for the relationship between men's fear of violent victimization and accountability to situated gender expectations in interaction and the persistence of gender inequality. Theoretically, this article engages a complex understanding of accountability and multiple masculinities to argue that the perceived threat of violence shapes men's practices in interaction.

For the interviewees, the context created by this research made it possible for the first time to establish a space to speak openly about this problem, in contrast to the existing context in which aggressors have remained unpunished. The inclusion of students' voices together with those of administrative staff and professors allowed for the identification of situations of gender violence.

1449,"The negative consequences of chronic alcohol abuse are well known, but heavy episodic consumption (""binge drinking"") is also associated with significant personal and societal harms. Aggressive tendencies are increased after alcohol but the mechanisms underlying these changes are not fully understood. While effects on behavioural control are likely to be important, other effects may be involved given the widespread action of alcohol. Altered processing of social signals is associated with changes in social behaviours, including aggression, but until recently there has been little research investigating the effects of acute alcohol consumption on these outcomes. Recent work investigating the effects of acute alcohol on emotional face processing has suggested reduced sensitivity to submissive signals (sad faces) and increased perceptual bias towards provocative signals (angry faces) after alcohol consumption, which may play a role in alcohol-related aggression.Here we discuss a putative mechanism that may explain how alcohol consumption influences emotional processing and subsequent aggressive responding, via disruption of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-amygdala connectivity. While the importance of emotional processing on social behaviours is well established, research into acute alcohol consumption and emotional processing is still in its infancy.

Health professionals have expressed inadequate medical knowledge and interpersonal skills to address sensitive issues, such as domestic, physical and sexual violence.

1451,"Background: Urban informal settlements remain sites of high HIV incidence and prevalence, as well as violence. Increasing attention is paid on how configurations of young men's masculinities shape these practices through exploring how men build respect and identity. In this paper, we explore how young Black South Africans in two urban informal settlements construct respect and a masculine identity. Methods: Data are drawn from three focus groups and 19 in-depth interviews. Results: We suggest that while young men aspire to a 'traditional' masculinity, prioritising economic power and control over the household, we suggest that a youth masculinity emerges which, in lieu of alternative ways to display power, prioritises violence and control over men's sexual partners, men seeking multiple sexual partners and men's violence to other men. This functions as a way of demonstrating masculinity and their position within a public gender order. Discussion:We suggest there are three implications of the findings for working with men on violence and HIVrisk reduction. First, there exist a number of contradictions in men's discourses about masculinity that may provide spaces and opportunities for change. Second, it is important to work on multiple issues at once given the way violence, alcohol use, and sexual risk are interlinked in youth masculinity. Finally, engaging with men's exclusion from the capitalist system may provide an important way to reduce violence. © 2014 Andrew Gibbs et al.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Global Health Action,17500154705,69,7,'Men value their dignity': Securing respect and identity construction in urban informal settlements in South Africa,1,true,10.3402/gha.v7.23676,Co-Action Publishinginfo@co-action.net,Global Health Action,2014.0,0.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': ""How young Black South Africans in two urban informal settlements construct respect and a masculine identity is explored, suggesting that a youth masculinity emerges which prioritises violence and control over men's sexual partners, men seeking multiple sexual partners and men's violence to other men.""}",1451,48793305,A.

1452,"The present study sheds light on relationships between distinct psychopathic traits and perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) in women versus men. Men and women with recent drug and/or violence histories (N = 250) were assessed for psychopathic traits using the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version and for their and their partners use of IPV with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. The first goal was to examine the moderating role of gender in psychopathy factor relationships to IPV. Although both the interpersonal- affective traits (Factor1) and the impulsive-antisocial traits (Factor 2) of psychopathy were related to higher frequency of IPV perpetration, the relationship between Factor 1 and IPV was stronger in men. Our second goal examined the moderating role of psychopathy traits in the relationship between partners perpetration of IPV and participant perpetration (mutual violence) in the 2 genders. Relationships between partner- and self-IPV were similar at both low and high levels of Factor 1 in men, although the partner- and self-IPV relationship was significantly stronger among women at low relative to high levels of Factor 1. The relationship between partner- and self-IPV was stronger at high levels of Factor 2 in men, whereas Factor 2 did not moderate mutual violence in women. These results indicate that relationships between psychopathy factors and IPV differ by gender, with psychopathy generally exacerbating IPV perpetration in men and Factor 1 traits playing a unique role in mutual violence in women.

1457,"Purpose To explore relationships between harassment (i.e., race-, weight-, socioeconomic-status (SES)-based, and sexual) and health-related outcomes, including self-esteem, depressive symptoms, body satisfaction, substance use, and self-harm behavior, among diverse adolescents. Method Cross-sectional analysis using data from a population-based study of adolescents participating in Eating and Activity in Teens 2010 (EAT 2010) (n = 2,793; mean age = 14.4 years). Sample was socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse (81% racial/ethnic minority; 54% low or low-middle income). Results Having experienced any type of harassment was significantly associated with poor self-esteem, depressive symptoms, low body satisfaction, substance use, and self-harm behaviors. After mutually adjusting for other types of harassment, weight-based harassment was consistently associated with lower self-esteem and lower body satisfaction in both genders (standardized βs ranged in magnitude from.39 to.48); sexual harassment was significantly associated with self-harm and substance use in both genders (ORs: 1.64 to 2.92); and both weight-based and sexual harassment were significantly associated with depressive symptoms among girls (standardized βs =.34 and.37). Increases in the number of different harassment types reported by adolescents were associated with elevated risk for alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use, and self-harm (ORs: 1.22 to 1.42) as well as emotional well-being (standardized βs:.13 to.26).

It includes a range of behaviors that are used to hurt, coerce, control, and intimidate intimate partners. This paper reviewed the conceptualizations of PA, summarized the extant literature on PA among LGB women and men, and offered recommendations to improve the investigation of PA among LGB individuals. The conceptualization, definition, measurement, and prevalence of PA perpetration and victimization vary widely across studies. Different definitions and methods of assessing PA, a lack of consistency in examining and reporting psychometric information on measures used to assess PA among LGB samples, and varying sample characteristics make it difficult to compare results across studies. As a result, we know relatively little about the antecedents and consequences of PA among LGB individuals. In order to advance research in this area and increase understanding of this serious public health problem, it is necessary to: (1) clarify what constitutes PA; (2) specify the psychometric aspects of measures used to assess PA; (3) report details about sexual minority participants' sexual orientation/identity; (4) examine LGB-specific variables; and (5) utilize advanced methodological and statistical approaches to studying PA. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014-01-01,Journal,Review,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,43,19,"Psychological aggression in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals' intimate relationships: A review of prevalence, correlates, and measurement issues",0,false,10.1016/j.avb.2014.04.001,Elsevier Ltd,,2014.0,79.0,7.0,,1458,3933001,Tyler B.

1459,"This literature review examines research exploring the interactions between transgender people and law enforcement and criminal justice (LECJ) personnel in the U.S. to better understand the experiences of transgender people who come into contact with the criminal justice system. A search of existing academic literature, public health reports, and advocacy group publications revealed 33 studies that contained information about transgender people's interactions with LECJ personnel. Results highlight how large percentages of transgender people experience arrest and incarceration, unjustified stops and arrest, disrespect and poor case handling, and abuse and violence from LECJ personnel while in their communities. Large percentages of transgender people in institutional settings also reported abuse committed by criminal justice personnel, including harassment, assault, and a lack of protection from other inmates. This review also highlights evidence of discriminatory and abusive treatment when transgender victims seek assistance from the legal system.

1460,"The relationship between transactional sex, HIV risk, and partner violence has been well documented in South Africa, but research has focused primarily on women and has not been conducted in high-risk social contexts. The aim of this study was to examine associations between transactional sex and HIV risk among women and men in alcohol-serving venues in Cape Town, South Africa. We surveyed 1,989 women and 2,468 men attending alcohol-serving venues in Cape Town, South Africa to assess transactional sex behavior (i.e., receiving money or goods in exchange for sex), alcohol and drug use, history of childhood abuse, current relationship violence, and sexual risk behaviors. Among both women and men, trading sex was related to higher alcohol use, greater likelihood of drug use, substance use in sexual contexts, and a greater likelihood of experiencing physical and sexual violence. Compared to other women, women who traded sex reported a greater proportion of condom-unprotected sex; this relationship was not found for men. Analyses showed that men were almost twice as more likely to report trading sex for items, including money or alcohol, than women (9.7 vs. 5.8 %). Overall, men who traded sex were similar to their female counterparts. Similar associations between trading sex and different risk behaviors were found among women and men with limited economic means and substance use problems. Future research should more closely study transactional sex in high-risk venues as it relates to violence and should examine men who trade sex as a potential bridge population between heterosexual women and men who have sex with men. © 2013 Society for Prevention Research.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Prevention Science,23019,11,15,"Men (and Women) as ""Sellers"" of Sex in Alcohol-Serving Venues in Cape Town, South Africa",2,,10.1007/s11121-013-0381-y,Springer New York LLCjournals@springer-sbm.com,Prevention Science,2014.0,51.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Examination of associations between transactional sex and HIV risk among women and men in alcohol-serving venues in Cape Town, South Africa found that trading sex was related to higher alcohol use, greater likelihood of drug use, substance use in sexual contexts, and a greater likely of experiencing physical and sexual violence.'}",1460,5435155,E.

1461,"This paper starts by arguing that visual data enriches gender research in management and organizations. Through an analysis of drawings by factory shop-floor workers, we show that organizational climate is interwoven with gender dynamics, that shop-floor masculinity is not necessarily heterosexual, and that masculinity in the shop-floor context includes oppression as an element of man's symbolic violence against man. We discuss the usefulness of this type of data in gender research in organizational analysis and explore the ways in which gender violence is expressed in organizations. Moreover, the drawings gathered at a newspaper printing site located in the North of England provide a means of showing the relationship between gender violence and the exercise of masculinities, sexuality and oppression. We conclude that the exercise of hegemonic masculinity is associated not only with sexuality but also with the oppression of subaltern enactments of masculinity. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,"Gender, Work and Organization",19295,8,21,"Imagining gender research: Violence, masculinity, and the shop floor",0,false,10.1111/gwao.12039,Blackwell Publishing Ltdcustomerservices@oxonblackwellpublishing.com,,2014.0,81.0,1.0,,1461,90071012,R.

1462,"This study examined the relationships among enculturation, attitudes supporting intimate partner violence (IPV-supporting attitudes), and gender role attitudes among one of the largest Asian Indian population groups in the US. Data were collected via computer-assisted telephone interviews with a random sample of Gujarati men and women aged 18-64 in Metropolitan Detroit. Using structural equation modeling, we modeled the effects of three components of enculturation (behavior, values, and community participation) on gender role attitudes and IPV-supporting attitudes among married respondents (N = 373). Analyses also accounted for the effects of respondent age, education, religious service attendance, perceived financial difficulty, and lengths of residence in the US. The second-order, overall construct of enculturation was the strongest predictor of IPV-supporting attitudes (standardized B = 0.61), but not gender role attitudes. Patriarchal gender role attitudes were positively associated with IPV-supporting attitudes (B = 0.49). In addition to the overall effect of the enculturation construct, two of the components of enculturation had specific effects. ""Enculturation-values"" had a specific positive indirect association with IPV-supporting attitudes, through its relationship with patriarchal gender role attitudes.

An interview survey was conducted of a random sample of adult residents in 11 communities of Japan. Among 4134 respondents (response rate, 55%), data from those who completed the part 2 interview (n=1682) were analyzed with a weight for this subsample. Lifetime experiences of 27 trauma events and PTSD were assessed using the WHO-Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0. Sixty percent of the part 2 sample reported exposure to at least one lifetime traumatic event. Lifetime and 12-month PTSD prevalences were 1.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Percentage of all months lived with PTSD in the population was predominantly accounted for by physical/sexual assaults and having a child with serious illness, and unexpected death of loved one. Ten percent of respondents reported ""private events"", for which respondents did not have to describe the content, which accounted for 19% of months with PTSD. The lower prevalence of PTSD in Japan seems attributable to lower conditional risks of PTSD following these events, as well as different distributions of the events.

1468,"Background: Risk factors for incarceration have been well described among adult drug using populations; however, less is known about incarceration among at-risk youth. This study examines the prevalence and correlates of incarceration among street-involved youth in a Canadian setting. Methods: From September 2005 to May 2012, data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14-26 who use illicit drugs. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with recent incarceration defined as incarceration in the previous six months. Results: Among 1019 participants, 362 (36%) reported having been recently incarcerated during the study period. In multivariate GEE analysis, homelessness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]. = 1.60), daily crystal methamphetamine use (AOR. = 1.56), public injecting (AOR. = 1.33), drug dealing (AOR. = 1.48) and being a victim of violence (AOR. = 1.68) were independently associated with incarceration (all p<. 0.05).

1469,"Substantial theoretical, empirical, and clinical work examines trauma as it relates to individual victims and perpetrators. As trauma professionals, it is necessary to acknowledge facets of institutions, cultures, and communities that contribute to trauma and subsequent outcomes. Systemic trauma-contextual features of environments and institutions that give rise to trauma, maintain it, and impact posttraumatic responses-provides a framework for considering the full range of traumatic phenomena. The current issue of the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation is composed of articles that incorporate systemic approaches to trauma. This perspective extends conceptualizations of trauma to consider the influence of environments such as schools and universities, churches and other religious institutions, the military, workplace settings, hospitals, jails, and prisons; agencies and systems such as police, foster care, immigration, federal assistance, disaster management, and the media; conflicts involving war, torture, terrorism, and refugees; dynamics of racism, sexism, discrimination, bullying, and homophobia; and issues pertaining to conceptualizations, measurement, methodology, teaching, and intervention. Although it may be challenging to expand psychological and psychiatric paradigms of trauma, a systemic trauma perspective is necessary on both scientific and ethical grounds. Furthermore, a systemic trauma perspective reflects current approaches in the fields of global health, nursing, social work, and human rights.

1470,"Introduction. Obtaining objective data on sexual offenders against minors is difficult. In order to enhance the possibilities to prevent such crimes it is essential to determine factors that condition this kind of sexual behavior. Aim. The aim of the study was to prepare a multidimensional analysis of a profile of sexual offenders against minors. Material and Method. A detailed analysis of documentation from forensic sexological, psychiatric and psychological examinations and information from the records of the proceedings concerning 257 perpetrators was performed by the authors. Information analyzed included demographic data, psychosocial background, psychosexual development, recent sexual activity, physical and mental health issues and information concerning accused sexual crime. Results. The majority of the offenders had undisturbed family relations. However, subjects with sexual preference disorders perceived their parents' relationship as worse, reported more difficulties in educational process and in relation to teachers and peers. 5.4% of subjects experienced sexual abuse and 23.3% physical violence in their childhood. The majority reported no sexual dysfunction and had regular but rare sexual activity. 20.6% were diagnosed as having mental disorder and 36.8% were alcohol abusers. Almost 30% were under influence of alcohol or another substance during the crime. The majority had no sexual preference disorder. Definite pedophilia was found in 27% and traits of psychosexual immaturity in 23.1% of cases. There was no relationship between sexual preference disorders and psychiatric comorbidity, alcohol or substance abuse. The acts of sexual abuse comprised genital touching, vaginal or oral intercourse as well as exposing offender's or victim's body. These acts were typically against one child, planned, being aware of victim's age and using physical violence. Conclusions.

1471,"Using a sample of 703 African American adolescents from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS) along with census data from the year 2000, we examine the association between neighborhood-level gender equality and violence. We find that boys' and girls' violent behavior is unevenly distributed across neighborhood contexts. In particular, gender differences in violent behavior are less pronounced in gender-equalitarian neighborhoods compared to those characterized by gender inequality. We also find that the gender gap narrows in gender-equalitarian neighborhoods because boys' rates of violence decrease whereas girls' rates remain relatively low across neighborhoods. This is in stark contrast to the pessimistic predictions of theorists who argue that the narrowing of the gender gap in equalitarian settings is the result of an increase in girls' violence. In addition, the relationship between neighborhood gender equality and violence is mediated by a specific articulation of masculinity characterized by toughness. Our results provide evidence for the use of gender-specific neighborhood prevention programs. © 2014 Springer Publishing Company.",2014-01-01,Journal,Article,Violence and Victims,18778,21,29,Gender equality and violent behavior: How neighborhood gender equality influences the gender gap in violence,2,,10.1891/0886-6708.VV-D-12-00102,Springer Publishing Company,Violence and Victims,2014.0,64.0,4.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is found that boys’ and girls’ violent behavior is unevenly distributed across neighborhood contexts, and gender differences in violent behavior are less pronounced in gender-equalitarian neighborhoods compared to those characterized by gender inequality.'}",1471,144474165,M.

1472,"Despite the vast literature on gender symmetry in the perpetration of domestic assault, few studies have looked specifically at both the female and male victims of violence. Using data from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) and building on the work of Johnson and Leone (2005), this study is a comparison of the female and male victims of intimate terrorism (IT) and an examination of the effects of IT on male victims. The findings indicate that IT, as a type of violence, does not have the same characteristics when the victims are men. Men involved in a terroristic marriage are not more likely to be injured, do not miss work more frequently, and are not more likely to report symptoms of depression compared to men involved in situational couple violence (SCV). Other findings appear to point to gender symmetry between women and men regarding IT, although broad conclusions based on these findings cannot be made in the absence of a sufficient means to measure the level of coercion within the relationship.

1476,"Purpose - This study will look at the relationship between norms on gender equality on the one hand and the level of gender equality in the political and socioeconomic sphere, the presence or absence of armed conflict, and general peacefulness on the other. Design/methodology/approach - Data on gender equality norms from the World Values Surveys, political and socioeconomic gender equality from the Global Gender Gap Index, armed conflict from the Uppsala Conflict Data Base, and general peacefulness from the Global Peace Index are analyzed in a bivariate correlation. Findings - The results show a significant association between norms on and attitudes toward gender equality and levels of political and socioeconomic gender equality, absence or presence of armed conflict, and level of general peacefulness. Research limitations - There is no data base on norms on and attitudes toward the use of violence which is why only levels of violence are included in the study. Social implications - The study shows that governments, aid agencies, NGOs and others working on conflict prevention and peace building need to focus on improving gender equality in order to achieve a sustainable decrease in conflict levels and an improvement in general levels of peacefulness.

1477,"Sex trafficking, trafficking for the purpose of forced sexual exploitation, is a widespread form of human trafficking that occurs in all regions of the world, affects mostly women and girls, and has far-reaching health implications. Studies suggest that up to 50%of sex trafficking victims in the USA seek medical attention while in their trafficking situation, yet it is unclear how the healthcare system responds to the needs of victims of sex trafficking. To understand the intersection of sex trafficking and public health, we performed in-depth qualitative interviews among 277 antitrafficking stakeholders across eightmetropolitan areas in five countries to examine the local context of sex trafficking. We sought to gain a new perspective on this form of gender-based violence from those who have a unique vantage point and intimate knowledge of push-and-pull factors, victim health needs, current available resources and practices in the health system, and barriers to care. Through comparative analysis across these contexts, we found that multiple sociocultural and economic factors facilitate sex trafficking, including child sexual abuse, the objectification of women and girls, and lack of income. Although there are numerous physical and psychological health problems associated with sex trafficking, health services for victims are patchy and poorly coordinated, particularly in the realm of mental health. Various factors function as barriers to a greater health response, including low awareness of sex trafficking and attitudinal biases among health workers. A more comprehensive and coordinated health system response to sex trafficking may help alleviate its devastating effects on vulnerablewomen and girls. There are numerous opportunities for local health systems to engage in antitrafficking efforts while partnering across sectors with relevant stakeholders. © 2013 The Author(s).",2013-12-01,Journal,Review,Journal of Urban Health,16448,89,90,An international comparative public health analysis of sex trafficking of women and girls in eight cities: Achieving a more effective health sector response,1,true,10.1007/s11524-013-9837-4,,Journal of urban health,2013.0,24.0,15.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'To understand the intersection of sex trafficking and public health, in-depth qualitative interviews among 277 antitrafficking stakeholders across eight metropolitan areas in five countries found that multiple sociocultural and economic factors facilitate sex trafficking, including child sexual abuse, the objectification of women and girls, and lack of income.'}",1477,1399399245,Wendy L.

1479,"Background: The link between heroin use and crime has been well established; however, there has been little opportunity to examine this relationship longitudinally. This study examines the relationship between static and dynamic predictors of criminal involvement, and the degree to which changes in dynamic risk factors moderate the risk of criminal involvement over time. Method: Data were collected as part of the Australian treatment outcome study, a 3-year longitudinal study of 615 people with heroin dependence conducted in Sydney, Australia. Past-month criminal involvement (property crime, drug dealing, fraud, violent crime), demographic, drug use and mental health characteristics were assessed at each interview. Results: Criminal involvement was consistently and independently predicted by lack of wage/salary as a main source of income, (OR 2.17), meeting diagnostic criteria for anti-social personality disorder (OR 1.91) and major depression (OR 1.41), screening positive for borderline personality disorder (OR 1.47), male sex (OR 1.44), a criminal history (OR 1.33), greater severity of dependence (OR 1.21), more extensive heroin use (OR 1.09), and younger age (OR 0.96) over the 3-year period. Conclusions: These findings provide strong evidence of the robust nature of the association between more extensive heroin use, severity of dependence, the co-occurrence of mental health conditions, and an individual's capacity for employment, and criminal involvement.

1480,"The geography of violence in Mexico has changed in recent years because of an explosive increase in regional homicide rates since 2006. This study relies on spatial statistical data analysis to address the issue of convergence in homicide victim rates across Mexican municipalities from 2001 to 2010. Based on the results of spatial panel modeling, we conclude that despite strong regional disparities in murders, municipal-level homicide growth rates display a pattern of convergence with spatial interaction features. This convergent pattern is gender-specific; the homicide growth rates for females show stronger convergence than those for males when local and regional factors are not considered. We postulate that homicide growth dynamics among females more closely follow the predictions of the ""modernization hypothesis"" than do the dynamics among males. This finding suggests that violence (specifically, homicides) against women in Mexico is driven by underlying factors other than short-term factors, such as drug cartel dynamics, and regional factors, such as local institutions and governments. The data might support the long-established feminist hypothesis that contends that violence against women follows specific dynamics that are different from the dynamics of violence against men. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013-12-01,Journal,Article,Applied Geography,27471,14,45,Gender bias in the convergence dynamics of the regional homicide rates in Mexico,0,false,10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.09.015,,,2013.0,40.0,0.0,,1480,112958983,Marcos Valdivia,145353500,R.

1481,"Objectives: Patients with mental illness are more exposed to violence than the general population. Tis study assessed factors associated with lifetime physical violence against these patients stratifed by sex in Brazil. Methods: Tis is a National cross-sectional multicenter study with a representative sample of 2,475 patients randomly selected from 26 public mental health services. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with physical violence and crude (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confdence interval were estimated. Statistical level considered was 0.05. Results: Te prevalence of lifetime physical violence against mental patients was similar for women (57.6%) and men (57.8%). Physical violence against women was independently associated with: previous psychiatric hospitalizations (aOR = 2.09), lifetime STD (aOR = 1.75), lifetime alcohol consumption (aOR = 1.59), age of sexual debut (< 16 y.o.) (aOR = 1.40), lifetime sex under alcohol/drugs use (aOR = 2.08), having received/ofered money for sex (aOR = 1.73) and lifetime incarceration (aOR = 1.69). Among men, associated factors were: age (18-40 y.o.) (aOR = 1.90), history of homelessness (aOR = 1.71), previous psychiatric hospitalization (aOR = 1.39), lifetime STD (aOR = 1.52), lifetime alcohol consumption (aOR = 1.41), lifetime use of marijuana or cocaine (aOR = 1.54), having received/ofered money for sex (aOR = 1.47), lifetime history of incarceration (aOR = 2.07). Discussion: Te prevalence of physical violence in this population was high for both sexes. Although there were similar factors independently associated with physical violence among men and women, there are important diferences, such as age of sexual debut and lifetime sex under alcohol/drugs use for women, but not for men, while younger age, history of homelessness, and lifetime use of marijuana or cocaine were associated factors for men only.

1482,"Researchers have not yet reached agreement about the validity of several competing explanations that seek to explain ethnic differences in juvenile violent offending. Ethnicity cannot solely explain why boys with an ethnic minority background commit more (violent) crimes. By assessing the intersectionality of structural, cultural and individual considerations, both the independent effects as well as the interplay between different factors can be examined. This study shows that aforementioned factors cumulatively play a role in severe violent offending, with parental connectedness and child abuse having the strongest associations.

1483,"Men are over-represented as both perpetrators and victims of violence. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between masculinity and violence from the perspectives of the perpetrators and victims. In order to provide the best available scientific evidence, four databases were searched and a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool was used to evaluate 10 studies. A meta-ethnography approach was also employed to synthesize the selected studies. The analysis revealed a number of reciprocal themes that act as risk factors for violence. This included a masculinization process, available resources, ethnic minority identification and alcohol and substance abuse. This review highlights the need for further research exploring different reciprocal themes and their association with masculinity and violence. Further research in this field could help clinicians improve their practice by helping clinicians widen their discussions about the violence committed by some males.

1484,"The violence graduation hypothesis assumes a direct causal link between animal cruelty and interpersonal aggression. This hypothesis is based on two postulates: (1) that animal cruelty precedes interpersonal aggression, and (2) that the effect is specific to violent forms of antisocial behavior. The current study was designed to test the second of these two postulates: i.e., specificity. Comparing reports of prior animal cruelty in violent and non-violent prisoners and patients, a 14-study meta-analysis revealed that the violent group was significantly more likely to have a history of animal cruelty than the non-violent group. Although this seemed to support the violence graduation hypothesis, uncontrolled differences between the violent and non-violent groups provide an alternative explanation of these results. In a second meta-analysis using a different set of studies (k=5), animal cruelty was found to correlate as well with non-violent offending as it did with violent offending in male and mixed gender samples. These latter results suggest that at least in males, the animal cruelty-offending relationship is not specific to violence and that theories other than the violence graduation hypothesis may be required to explain the modest association that exists between animal cruelty and violent offending. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013-11-01,Journal,Review,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,25,18,Testing the specificity postulate of the violence graduation hypothesis: Meta-analyses of the animal cruelty-offending relationship,0,false,10.1016/j.avb.2013.10.002,,,2013.0,37.0,2.0,,1484,2119585,G.

1485,"Door supervision work is traditionally seen as a working-class, male-dominated trade. In addition, it is deemed to be one that is physically risky, where violence is seen as a 'tool of the trade' and where 'bodily capital' and 'fighting ability' are paramount to the competent performance of the job. This paper is a timely analysis on the manner in which the increasing numbers of women who work in door supervision negotiate their occupational identity and construct their work practices. The analysis focused on the way in which discursive constructions of both violence and workplace identities are variably taken up, reworked and resisted through the intersection of gender and class. This resulted in the identification of two main discourses; 'playing the hero' and the 'hard matriarch'. These findings allow us to theorize that multiple, gendered and classed occupational identities exist beyond normative expectations and can be seen to be both emancipatory for working women, while simultaneously bolstering exploitation, workplace harassment and violent practices. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2013-11-01,Journal,Article,"Gender, Work and Organization",19295,13,20,"'Heroes and matriarchs': Working-class femininities, violence and door supervision work",0,false,10.1111/gwao.12002,,,2012.0,67.0,0.0,,1485,8601933,B.

1486,"Background: Analysis of the relevance of the variables sex and gender to explain delinquency is a topic of growing interest in Criminology. This study tests a model of juvenile delinquency that integrates gender identity, the association with deviant peers, and a lack of attachment to conventional contexts. Method: We used a sample of 970 adolescents of both sexes, representative of the urban population, between 12 and 18 years, attending public schools in Galicia (Spain). Results: The results of path analysis confirm that: a) weak attachment to conventional contexts, and belonging to a deviant groups are precedents for deviation of adolescents of both sexes; b) these contexts also contribute to the development of gender identity; and c) gender identity affects the likelihood of deviation: femininity tends to reduce this behavior, and masculinity (in particular, negatively valued masculinity) contributes to increase it. Conclusions: These findings support the adequacy of including gender identity in the explanatory models of delinquency.

Seventy-two percent of children had a history of violent behavior, including 25 children (31%) with a history of severe violence. Of those with a history of violence, 60% had a least one episode of violence that did not appear to be in response to an external stimulus (internally driven violence). There was no significant impact of age or gender. For many children, these internally driven violent episodes were rare and unpredictable, but severe.

1489,"Child trafficking, including commercial sexual exploitation (CSE), is one of the fastest growing and most lucrative criminal activities in the world. The global enslavement of children affects countless numbers of victims who are trafficked within their home countries or transported away from their homes and treated as commodities to be bought, sold, and resold for labor or sexual exploitation. All over the world, girls are particularly likely to be trafficked into the sex trade: Girls and women constitute 98% of those who are trafficked for CSE. Health and safety standards in exploitative settings are generally extremely low, and the degree of experienced violence has been linked with adverse physical, psychological, and social-emotional development. The human-rights-based approach to child trafficking provides a comprehensive conceptual framework whereby victim-focused and law enforcement responses can be developed, implemented, and evaluated.

1490,"Internationally and locally, crime fiction is a literary genre that has been gaining large numbers of readers as well as increasing academic attention.These texts offer imaginative spaces where authors can expose and critique social problems. Margie Orford's crime fiction offers an avenue through which to explore the pervasive presence of violence in the lives of South African women and children. A number of feminist literary scholars have, however, questioned whether the traditionally male genre of the crime novel can be adapted by women authors to voice the experiences of female characters. Although the challenges presented by the genre are real, the analysis suggests that Orford succeeds, at least partially, in contributing to the larger feminist project of revealing the ubiquity of gender violence in contemporary society. The horrifically violent crimes that constitute the main plot elements of Orford's novels emerge as merely the most extreme examples of the gender violence that has become a normalized part of many women and girls' daily lived realities.

1491,"The serotonin system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are involved in the biological vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. Altered levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate ester DHEAS have been reported in neuropsychiatric conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate CSF levels of 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and CSF and plasma levels of cortisol and DHEAS in 28 medication free suicide attempters and 19 healthy volunteers. Another aim was to investigate the relationship between neuroendocrine measures and childhood trauma in suicide attempters. As the study design includes a longitudinal part, we investigated whether CSF cortisol, 5-HIAA or DHEAS would predict subsequent suicide. We hypothesized higher cortisol levels in suicide attempters and lower CSF 5-HIAA levels and higher cortisol levels in suicide victims. Suicide attempters had higher CSF and plasma cortisol levels compared to healthy volunteers. Male suicide attempters had higher CSF DHEAS levels and female suicide attempters had lower CSF 5-HIAA levels compared to male and female healthy volunteers respectively.

1492,"Two million women and one million men experience rape, stalking, or physical assault by a current or former romantic partner each year in the U.S. Not only do women report twice the incidents, but intimate partner violence (IPV) that women experience is typically more severe. Explanations for IPV gender asymmetry include male dominance attitudes, hostile sexism, and men's control-seeking. There are gaps in our knowledge of how attitudes and control-seeking co-relate to influence IPV. This study demonstrates a mediation analysis to investigate these relationships. Data were from a cross-sectional online survey of male undergraduate students from a public Southeastern university. The survey measured attitudes of male dominance and hostile sexism, desire for control, and IPV perpetration. After including age and academic level in the model, male dominance remained a significant predictor of likelihood of physical IPV (OR = 1.16, p = .004) but not psychological IPV. The addition of control-seeking (physical OR = 1.65, p < .001) mediated the influence of male dominance on the likelihood of physical IPV perpetration (OR = 1.018, p = .753). Hostile sexism was a significant predictor of psychological and physical IPV (psychological IPV OR = 1.31, p < .001; physical IPV OR = 1.54, p < .001), over and above age and academic level. The addition of control-seeking (psychological IPV OR = 1.27, p < .001; physical OR = 1.53, p < .001) partially mediated the influence of hostile sexism on IPV (psychological IPV OR = 1.21, p = .001; physical OR = 1.34, p < .001). Results suggest control-seeking mediates the relationship between male dominance and physical IPV and partially mediates the relationship between hostile sexism and IPV.

Other than media (notably internet) information on the incidents, this situation and the general issue of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the Nigerian immigrant community is yet to gain awareness in scholarship. This paper is a discussion of IPV in the context of internet commentaries posted by Nigerians in the wake of the murder incidents. The commentaries mostly attribute the murders to acculturative tensions in Nigerian patriarchal gender relations and economic-based gender role-reversal in U.S-based immigrant Nigerian families.

1498,"The measurement of intimate partner violence (IPV) has proven to be more complex than originally anticipated and content and construct validity need to be greatly improved for IPV assessment. For measurement of IPV in the United States, these validity issues range from providing the most accurate wording for the content domain to controversies as to when violent actions are counted (e.g., self-defense) or whether to include mild aggression (e.g., psychological conflict tactics) that may be more normative and not harmful. The three major forms of IPV (i.e., physical, sexual, and psychological abuse) have distinct validity issues and may require different modalities for assessment. Gender needs to be considered when establishing construct validity due to differences in the meaning of aggression, impacts of abuse, and even patterns of violence for women and men. External threats to validity include potential bias of self-report and motivations when reporting on a partner, discrepancies in couples' reports, the influence of response styles, and design issues affecting reporting.

We examine strengths and weaknesses of the original IPV assessment approaches and describe the modifications and extensions that have been employed to improve our understanding of the multifaceted nature of IPV. We next discuss more recent movements in IPV assessment, including the assessment of non-heterosexual relationships, the examination of various (and often intersecting) forms of IPV, and the identification of qualitatively different types of IPV. We provide an analogy between the assessment of IPV and the assessment of other problems such as depression, and compare the differences between an assessment of symptoms and an assessment of impairment or harm. We conclude by highlighting the need for multi-method assessment approaches that can account for both the frequency and intensity of aggressive acts, as well as the context, motivations, and impacts of such acts, in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of violence in intimate relationships. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2013-08-01,Journal,Article,Sex Roles,14798,39,69,Intimate Partner Violence Assessment in an Historical Context: Divergent Approaches and Opportunities for Progress,0,false,10.1007/s11199-013-0294-z,,Sex Roles,2013.0,92.0,0.0,,1499,3837300,E.

1500,"Background: Research examining mental health in violence-Affected youth in representative samples is rare. Using data from the nationally representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) this study reports on gender-specific prevalence rates and associations of a broad range of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems: emotional problems, conduct problems, ADHD, disordered eating, somatic pain and substance use in youth variously affected by violence. While internalizing is generally more common in girls and externalizing in boys, observations of prior non-normative studies suggest reverse associations once an individual is affected by violence. The occurrence of such ""gender cross-over effects"" is therefore examined in a representative sample. Methods. The sample consisted of 6,813 adolescents aged 11 to 17 from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS): Applying multivariate logistic regression analyses, associations between each type of violence history and mental health indicator were determined for perpetrators, victims, and perpetrating victims of youth violence. Moderating effects of gender were examined by using product term interaction. Results: Victim status was associated primarily with internalizing problems, while perpetrators were more prone to externalizing problems. Perpetrating victims stood out with respect to the number and strength of risk associations with all investigated mental health indicators. However, the risk profiles of all violence-Affected youth included both internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. Gender cross-over effects were found for girls and boys: despite lower overall prevalence, girls affected by violence were at far higher risk for conduct problems and illicit drug use; by contrast, somatic pain, although generally lower in males, was positively associated with perpetrator status and perpetrating victim status in boys. All violence-Affected youth exhibited significantly higher rates of cumulative mental health problems. Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of violence for the mental health of youth. They reveal a particular vulnerability as a function of gender.

Methods: On discharge from two psychiatric hospitals in Stockholm, 331 patients were interviewed. Telephone interviews with the patients and supportive others, as well as data from a national criminal register, were used to measure violent behavior 20 weeks after discharge. After the baseline interview, patients were assigned to different risk groups by the COVR software. Predicted risk was compared with the occurrence of actual acts of violence during the follow-up. Results: Gender differences in base rates of violent behavior among the general psychiatric population were not found during the 20 weeks of follow-up after discharge. Violent behavior was significantly predicted by young age of males and by level of anger, violent thoughts, and victimization of females. The predictive validity of the COVR software was comparable between females (area under the curve [AUC]=.78) and males (AUC=.76). Conclusions: Violent behavior was uncommon for all patients.

We focused on two-wheel riding behavior among a sample of 1,028 Italian adolescents at their first driving experience.

In particular, risk perception was a significant mediator between personality, social norm, and riding behavior. The significant relations that emerged in the general sample were further confirmed in the two specific sub-samples of males and females. In terms of social marketing and educational communication, it may consequently be advisable to proceed in an integrated and coordinated manner at both the cognitive and social level, taking into account some dispositions to risk related to personality.

1504,"In spite of successful treatment options for depression, the majority of Americans with severe depression do not receive treatment. Latinos are even less likely to engage in treatment than non-Hispanic Whites. The purpose of this study is to explore barriers to treatment engagement and, more specifically, how childhood adversity and gender-based violence (GBV) contribute to a lack of perceived support for treatment engagement. Experiences of GBV and childhood adversity can call into question deeply held family, cultural, and religious values, and affect the perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship and attitudes about depression treatment. A qualitative descriptive methodology was used to understand the experiences of a sample of 12 Latinas who were part of a diabetes prevention study (n = 67) and had been referred for treatment because of elevated symptoms of depression. Results indicate that the often-cited barriers to mental health care (i.e., language barriers, economic considerations, and lack of illness recognition) did not serve as deterrents for Latinas in this study. Participants recognized that they were depressed and agreed with the assessment of depression. However, none of the women followed up on the recommendation to seek care. What has emerged from this study is how cultural values, such as familismo and marianismo, and the lack of responsiveness from family and religious leaders in the context of exposure to GBV and childhood adversity created significant barriers to treatment engagement.

1510,"The assessment and prevention of aggressive behavior are critical components of contemporary psychiatric inpatient care, treatment, and management. This prospective study compared the predictive validity of three dynamic violence risk assessment measures (i.e. Brøset Violence Checklist (BVC), Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression (DASA), and HCR-20 Clinical scale) for imminent aggression (within the next 24 h). The DASA and BVC were developed specifically to assess imminent violence within psychiatric hospitals, whereas the HCR-20 is a 'general' violence risk assessment measure that can also be used for this purpose. Daily risk ratings were completed for 70 psychiatric inpatients; a total of 3449 ratings for each risk assessment measure were obtained. Results showed that the DASA and BVC were acceptable to outstanding predictive validity and were more accurate than the HCR-20 Clinical scale for predicting inpatient aggression. Actuarial and structured professional ratings were similar for the prediction of verbal threats, but actuarial ratings were more accurate for predicting interpersonal violence. Overall, these findings support the use of structured dynamic risk assessment measures to aid in the prediction of imminent aggression within inpatient psychiatric settings. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2013-04-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology,16709,33,24,"Predicting aggression in acute inpatient psychiatric setting using BVC, DASA, and HCR-20 Clinical scale",0,false,10.1080/14789949.2013.773456,,,2013.0,44.0,4.0,,1510,8351761,C.

1511,"Objective: To combine the results of earlier comparison studies of in-patient aggression to quantitatively assess the strength of the association between patient factors and i) aggressive behaviour,ii) repetitive aggressive behaviour. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis of empirical articles and reports of comparison studies of aggression and non-aggression within adult psychiatric in-patient settings. Results: Factors that were significantly associated with in-patient aggression included being younger, male, involuntary admissions, not being married, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, a greater number of previous admissions, a history of violence, a history of self-destructive behaviour and a history of substance abuse. The only factors associated with repeated in-patient aggression were not being male, a history of violence and a history of substance abuse. Conclusion: By comparing aggressive with non-aggressive patients, important differences between the two populations may be highlighted. These differences may help staff improve predictions of which patients might become aggressive and enable steps to be taken to reduce an aggressive incident occurring using actuarial judgements. However, the associations found between these actuarial factors and aggression were small. It is therefore important for staff to consider dynamic factors such as a patient's current state and the context to reduce in-patient aggression. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",2013-04-01,Journal,Review,Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica,17574,171,127,A review and meta-analysis of the patient factors associated with psychiatric in-patient aggression,0,false,10.1111/acps.12053,,Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica,2013.0,81.0,10.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'To combine the results of earlier comparison studies of in‐patient aggression to quantitatively assess the strength of the association between patient factors and i) aggressive behaviour,ii) repetitive aggressive behaviour.'}",1511,46476189,C.

1512,"Anti-trafficking rhetoric and policies emphasise the extent of exploitation and coercion of female migrant sex workers and obfuscate the shared ambivalences and contradictions experienced by migrant female sex workers and their male agents and partners. By engaging in the global sex industry, both young men and women negotiate their aspiration to cosmopolitan late modern lifestyles against the prevalence of essentialist patriarchal gender values and sexual mores at home. In the process, established gender normativities, legitimising women's subjection to men, are both reproduced and challenged. The evidence informing this article shows that a minority of women are coerced into the sex industry. There is a direct link between the adherence to essentialist gender/sexual roles and the recourse to violence and exploitation, because migrants' prolonged involvement in the sex industry coincides with the adherence to more cosmopolitan gender/sexual roles, translating into less authoritarian and violent discourses and practices. Hegemonic understandings of migrants' involvement in the global sex industry in terms of 'trafficking' erase these important dynamics and dimensions, which underpin intricate feelings and experiences of advantage, disadvantage and exploitation. By failing to engage with the meanings that migrants working in the sex industry ascribe to their working and personal lives, the (anti)trafficking logic of 'humanitarian intervention' enforces forms of solidarity and support that appeal to the minority and harm the majority of the people they are supposed to 'rescue'. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2013-03-01,Journal,Article,"Gender, Place and Culture",23638,52,20,Embodied cosmopolitanisms: The subjective mobility of migrants working in the global sex industry,0,false,10.1080/0966369X.2011.649350,,,2013.0,64.0,4.0,,1512,103477452,N.

1513,"Research into the relationship between alcohol and aggression has previously focused on men. However, in recent years there has been an increase in binge drinking and violent crime among women, behaviours which have been labelled 'ladette' culture in the UK. The current study advances the literature in this area by investigating the relationship between alcohol consumption and aggressive behaviour of females in licensed premises, including the type of aggression and motivations for aggressive incidents. Ninety-three female university students completed the Student Alcohol Questionnaire (SAQ; Engs, 2002), the Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992) and a questionnaire developed to measure self-reported aggressive incidents. Females who had been involved in an aggressive incident reported spending more time on average in licensed premises per week and higher levels of aggression as well as consuming significantly more alcohol on the day of the incident than females who had not been involved in an aggressive incident. Contrary to expectations, however, those who had been involved in an aggressive incident did not report drinking more beer (a male-orientated drink) than those who had not. Verbally aggressive incidents were reported more than physically aggressive incidents, and aggression was commonly motivated by an emotional reaction or to address a grievance. The finding that average alcohol consumption per week was significantly associated with female aggression in licensed premises highlights the importance of developing interventions to reduce alcohol consumption among young females. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013-03-01,Journal,Article,Addictive Behaviors,24763,5,38,"Female alcohol consumption, motivations for aggression and aggressive incidents in licensed premises",0,false,10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.08.009,,Addictive Behaviours,2013.0,57.0,0.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The finding that average alcohol consumption per week was significantly associated with female aggression in licensed premises highlights the importance of developing interventions to reduce alcohol consumption among young females.'}",1513,7789304,M.

1515,"Objective: In this cross-sectional study on family violence and resilience in a random sample of 5,149 middle school students with a mean age of 14.5 years from four EU-countries (Austria, Germany, Slovenia, and Spain) we examined the prevalence of exposure to family violence, and we worked from the premise that adolescent can be resilient to family violence. We expanded the definition of resilience to include the absence of both physical aggression and depression symptoms in adolescents who have been exposed to violence in their families and extended our understanding of resilience to include three levels which we describe as: "" resilient"" , "" near-resilient"" and "" non-resilient"" , thus responding to calls for a more fluid and paths-based understanding of resilience. Methods: Data were collected via self-administered surveys consisting of a number of subscales that investigate depression symptoms and physical aggression. The study was analyzed with a three-stage strategy using logistic regression procedures, in which regression analyses were conducted separately for girls and boys using seven steps for modeling the three resilience levels. Results: More than 30% of our respondents reported experiencing family violence. Contrary to previous research findings, our data showed that structural characteristics like country, gender, socio-economic status and migration status were minimally predictive of violence and depression resilience at any level. Overall, for both sexes, despite some small but significant sex differences, resilience is strongly linked to personal and relational characteristics and the absence of experiences that involved exposure to and direct experiences with violence. Resilience supportive factors confirmed by this study are: higher emotional self-control, talking with parents or friends about violence, seeking help to avoid violence, and not endorsing aggression supportive beliefs. Also key to resilience are irrespective of country, gender, and SES are lower levels of experience with: victimization by boys, engagement in physical altercation with boys, parental abuse, witnessing of physical spousal abuse, exposure to an authoritarian (harsh) parenting style and verbal aggression from teachers. Conclusion: From a content perspective this means that resilience is more than the absence of one or two behavioral factors. This also means that positive changes in resilience levels can be facilitated by supporting constructive personal and social relationships with family members, peers, and teachers.

1517,"This article examines evidence for violence as reflected in skull injuries in 378 individuals from Neolithic Denmark and Sweden (3,900-1,700 BC). It is the first large-scale crossregional study of skull trauma in southern Scandinavia, documenting skeletal evidence of violence at a population level. We also investigate the widely assumed hypothesis that Neolithic violence is male-dominated and results in primarily male injuries and fatalities. Considering crude prevalence and prevalence for individual bones of the skull allows for a more comprehensive understanding of interpersonal violence in the region, which is characterized by endemic levels of mostly nonlethal violence that affected both men and women. Crude prevalence for skull trauma reaches 9.4% in the Swedish and 16.9% in the Danish sample, whereas element-based prevalence varies between 6.2% for the right frontal and 0.6% for the left maxilla, with higher figures in the Danish sample. Significantly more males are affected by healed injuries but perimortem injuries affect males and females equally. These results suggest habitual male involvement in nonfatal violence but similar risks for both sexes for sustaining fatal injuries. In the Danish sample, a bias toward front and left-side injuries and right-side injuries in females support this scenario of differential involvement in habitual interpersonal violence, suggesting gendered differences in active engagement in conflict. It highlights the importance of large-scale studies for investigating the scale and context of violence in early agricultural societies, and the existence of varied regional patterns for overall injury prevalence as well as gendered differences in violence-related injuries.

1526,"Most interest in violence and gender has focused on certain types of victimization such as sex offenses and relational aggression. This study examined gender patterns across numerous forms of youth victimization. The data are from the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV), a nationally representative U.S. sample of 4,549 children ages 1 month to 17 years obtained through a telephone survey of caregivers and youth. For 18 of 21 victimization types, male perpetration was significantly more common than female perpetration. Perpetrator-victim patterns revealed that most forms of physical assault and bullying showed a predominantly male-on-male pattern. All forms of sexual assault, plus kidnapping, showed a predominantly male-on-female pattern. Nonphysical maltreatment showed a mixed pattern, with fairly similar rates across all four gender configurations. Many violence types were more severe when perpetrated by males versus females as indicated by higher injury rates and greater victim fear. Higher order analyses by victimization type indicated, among other findings, that victimization types with more stranger perpetrators had more male perpetrators, victimizations with higher percentages of male-on-female and female-on-male incidents were more likely to be sexual offenses, and higher percentages of female-on-female incidents were associated with verbal victimizations. Results also suggest that males are more likely to aggress in more impersonal contexts compared to females.

1529,"Background: Homicide is an important cause of premature mortality globally, but evidence for the magnitude of homicides by intimate partners is scarce and hampered by the large amount of missing information about the victim-offender relationship. The objective of the study was to estimate global and regional prevalence of intimate partner homicide. Methods: A systematic search of fi ve databases (Medline, Global Health, Embase, Social Policy, and Web of Science) yielded 2167 abstracts, and resulted in the inclusion of 118 full-text articles with 1122 estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner homicide after double-blind screening. All studies were included that reported the number or proportion of women or men who were murdered by an intimate partner in a country, province, or town, using an inclusive defi nition of an intimate partner. Additionally, a survey of offi cial sources of 169 countries provided a further 53 estimates. We selected one estimate per country-year using a quality assessment decision algorithm. The median prevalence of intimate partner homicide was calculated by country and region overall, and for women and men separately. Findings: Data were obtained for 66 countries. Overall 13.5% (IQR 9.2-18.2) of homicides were committed by an intimate partner, and this proportion was six times higher for female homicides than for male homicides (38.6%, 30.8-45.3, vs 6.3%, 3.1-6.3). Median percentages for all (male and female) and female intimate partner homicide were highest in high-income countries (all, 14.9%, 9.2-18.2; female homicide, 41.2%, 30.8-44.5) and in southeast Asia (18.8%, 11.3-18.8; 58.8%, 58.8-58.8). Adjustments to account for unknown victim-off ender relationships generally increased the prevalence, suggesting that results presented are conservative. Interpretation: At least one in seven homicides globally and more than a third of female homicides are perpetrated by an intimate partner. Such violence commonly represents the culmination of a long history of abuse. Strategies to reduce homicide risk include increased investment in intimate partner violence prevention, risk assessments at diff erent points of care, support for women experiencing intimate partner violence, and control of gun ownership for people with a history of violence. Improvements in country-level data collection and monitoring systems are also essential, because data availability and quality varied strongly across regions.

1530,"The current study aimed to identify personality traits, emotional states and adjustment variables in a sample of pathological gamblers as compared to a non-gambling control group taking gender differences into account. The sample for this study consisted of 206 subjects (103 pathological gamblers and 103 non-psychiatric subjects from the general population matched for age and gender). Pathological gamblers had a lower educational level and a family history of alcohol abuse higher than non-gamblers. In turn, female gamblers were affected by unemployment and a lower socioeconomic status more often than female non-gamblers. Pathological gamblers were more anxious and impulsive and suffered from a poorer self-esteem than non-gamblers. Likewise, pathological gamblers had a greater history of other Axis I psychiatric disorders and were more often affected by anxiety and depression symptoms and showed a more problematic adjustment to everyday life than non-gamblers. Alcohol abuse was not higher in pathological gamblers than in non-gamblers, but, when gender was taken into account, male gamblers were more affected by alcohol abuse than male non-gamblers. Importantly 68.6% of female gamblers versus 9.8% of control group women reported being victims of intimate partner violence.

1531,"Primary prevention of men's intimate partner violence (IPV) toward women in dating relationships is an important area of psychological inquiry and a significant concern for counselors working with college student populations. Previous research has identified that certain beliefs condoning or accepting physical, sexual, and psychological violence in relationships are key risk factors for IPV perpetration; however, comparatively few studies have examined the social and relational variables related to IPV acceptance attitudes. In the present study, we proposed and tested a structural model examining the combined contributions of adult attachment dimensions (i.e., attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) and masculine gender role stress in the prediction of IPV acceptance attitudes in a large sample of college men (N = 419). We hypothesized that the relationship between attachment insecurity and IPV acceptance attitudes would be partially mediated by men's gender role stress. A partially mediated model produced the best indices of model fit, accounting for 31% of the variance in an IPV acceptance attitudes latent variable. A bootstrapping procedure confirmed the significance of mediation effects. These results suggest that aspects of adult attachment insecurity are associated with tendencies to experience stress from violations of rigidly internalized traditional male role norms, which, in turn, are associated with acceptance of IPV. Findings are further discussed in relation to adult attachment theory (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007), gender role strain theory (Pleck, 1995), and their implications for IPV prevention in college student populations. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",2013-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Counseling Psychology,15452,32,60,College men's intimate partner violence attitudes: Contributions of adult attachment and gender role stress,0,false,10.1037/a0030353,,Journal of counseling and psychology,2013.0,72.0,1.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results suggest that aspects of adult attachment insecurity are associated with tendencies to experience stress from violations of rigidly internalized traditional male role norms, which, in turn, areassociated with acceptance of IPV.'}",1531,8202417,Ryon C Mcdermott,145131754,F.

1533,"Background: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). While previous studies of idiopathic RBD have reported a striking male preponderance, little information exists about potential gender differences of RBD in PD. Methods: We performed a cross sectional study of 107 PD patients. Probable RBD (pRBD) was diagnosed using the RBD Screening Questionnaire. Results: Men had more fights (96% versus 54%, p < 0.001), violent behavior (71% versus 39%, p = 0.04) and awakening by own movements (89% versus 62%, p = 0.04). More women experienced disturbed sleep (85% versus 32%, p = 0.02). The frequency of pRBD was 31% in women and 43% in men (p = 0.2), total frequency 38%. Conclusions: We found no clear differences in the frequency of pRBD among men and women with PD, but demonstrated significant gender differences in its clinical expression.

1534,"Background: The impact of gender and violence on brief interventions (BIs) for alcohol use in the emergency department (ED) has not been studied. Our objective was to examine the effectiveness of alcohol BIs in an ED population stratified by gender and violence. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of datasets pooled from three ED-based randomized controlled studies of alcohol BIs. AUDIT-C was the primary outcome measure; secondary outcomes were binge drinking and achievement of NIAAA safe drinking levels. We conducted univariate comparisons and developed generalized linear models (GLM) for the primary outcome and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models for secondary outcomes to examine the intervention effect on the whole study group, gender-stratified subgroups, and gender- and violence-stratified subgroups. Results: Of 1219 participants enrolled, 30% were female; 31% of women and 42% of men reported violence involvement at baseline. In univariate analysis, no differences in outcomes were found between intervention and control groups for any subgroup. However, in multivariable models, men demonstrated an intervention effect for likelihood of safe drinking limits. Stratifying further by violence, only men without violence involvement demonstrated a positive intervention effect for safe drinking limits. There was no evidence of an intervention effect on women. Conclusions: Analyzing the overall effect of ED-based BI may mask its ability to improve alcohol-related outcomes in a subset of the population.

1535,"Background: Most studies of the prevalence of psychoactive substances in injured emergency department patients have excluded those who arrive more than 6. h after injury. This may cause a selection bias. The aim of this study was: (1) to describe the characteristics of patients who arrive more than 6. h after injury, compared to patients who arrive sooner (2) to examine whether self-report can add to the assessment of alcohol use when the patient is assessed more than 6. h after injury. Methods: Blood sample analysis and self-report data were used to assess the prevalence of psychoactive substances in injured patients admitted to an emergency department within 48. h of injury (n= 1611). Discriminant function analysis was used to assess group differences. Results: The patients who arrived more than 6. h after injury differed significantly from those who arrived earlier in several respects. They more often screened positive for hypnotics; they were older, they were more likely to have had a fall and they were more often injured at home and at night. Self reported use of alcohol showed good consistency with blood sample screening within 6. h of injury and could therefore be used to assess alcohol use more than 6. h after injury. Conclusions: Patients who arrive more than 6. h after injury differ significantly from those who arrive earlier.

1536,"Exposure to interparental violence is associated with negative outcomes, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and reduced cognitive abilities. However, little is known about the potential effects of witnessing domestic violence during childhood on gray matter volume (GMV) or cortical thickness. High-resolution 3.0 T volumetric scans (Siemens Trio Scanner) were obtained on 52 subjects (18-25 years) including 22 (6 males/16 females) with a history of visually witnessing episodes of domestic violence, and 30 (8 males/22 females) unexposed control subjects, with neither a current nor past DSM-IV Axis I or II disorder. Potential confounding effects of age, gender, level of parental verbal aggression, parental education, financial stress, full scale IQ, and total GMV, or average thickness were modeled using voxel based morphometry and FreeSurfer. Witnessing domestic violence subjects had a 6.1% GMV reduction in the right lingual gyrus (BA18) (P = 0.029, False Discovery Rate corrected peak level). Thickness in this region was also reduced, as was thickness in V2 bilaterally and left occipital pole. Theses regions were maximally sensitive to exposure to witnessing domestic violence between 11-13 years of age. Regional reductions in GMV and thickness were observed in both susceptible and resilient witnessing domestic violence subjects. Results in subjects witnessing domestic violence were similar to previously reported results in subjects with childhood sexual abuse, as the primary region affected was visual cortex. Brain regions that process and convey the adverse sensory input of the abuse may be specifically modified by this experience, particularly in subjects exposed to a single type of maltreatment. Exposure to multiple types of maltreatment is more commonly associated with morphological alterations in corticolimbic regions.

1537,"There are few studies on men dealing with violence as a non-fatal event. As a contribution, the prevalences of psychological, physical and/or sexual violence suffered by men and the perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) are described. This was a cross-sectional study on 789 men aged 18 to 60 years, of whom 775 ever partnered. Men were selected in order of arrival at two primary healthcare clinics in the city of São Paulo. Sociodemographic characteristics and reported violence were investigated, along with the violence overlapping and perceptions of having suffered or perpetrated violence. The lifetime prevalence of suffered violence was 79% for any type and any aggressor; 63.9%, 52.8% and 6.1% respectively for psychological, physical and sexual violence. For lifetime IPV, the rates were 52.1% for any type and 40%, 31.9% and 3.9% respectively for psychological, physical and sexual violence. For both suffered and perpetrated violence, the psychological type had the highest exclusive rate, followed by physical. Acquaintances were the main aggressors, followed by family members, strangers and female intimate partners. Between suffering and perpetrating IPV, 14.2% of the cases overlapped and 81.2% consisted only of perpetrated violence. It was concluded that although in relation to intimate partner violence, men suffered much less than they perpetrated, the data showed that they were involved in many situations of violence of large magnitude and overlapping situations, both as victims and as aggressors, thus echoing studies on masculinity.

Students (N=336) completed questionnaires about use of specific coping strategies at two time periods: immediately following the incident, and 3-6 months later. Students reported more use of acceptance-coping approaches initially, and use increased over time. Students' use of avoidance-coping approaches declined over time. Women used more religious- and emotion-focused coping strategies than did men at both time periods, but use of these strategies declined for all students over time. Men used more active coping initially, but over time, use declined for men and increased for women. Overall, students displayed resiliency. The differences in the use of coping strategies by men and women and the changes in use over time demonstrate the unfolding transitional process of coping, and make it clear that people cope in different ways and in their own time.

1540,"In order to extend knowledge about the communicative aspects of intimate partner violence (IPV), we ask how those who talk about IPV frame the relationship between gender and power. How does their framing account for the role of gender in IPV perpetration? A critical discourse analysis of conversations from focus groups and interviews reveals that when participants talk about IPV, they rely on ideological dilemmas in available understandings of the relationship between gender and power. As participants use disclaimers, competing interpretive repertoires, and extreme case arguments to navigate these dilemmas, their talk closes space for a critique of gender and power that considers systemic factors and benevolent sexism. Instead, participants focus more on individual pathology and the most overt forms of sexism. The tensions that produce this closure may also reveal contradictions that provide opportunities for reshaping public conversations about IPV and its relationship to gender and power. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012-11-01,Journal,Article,Discourse and Society,13524,26,23,"'I'm not sexist, but...': How ideological dilemmas reinforce sexism in talk about intimate partner violence",0,false,10.1177/0957926512455382,,,2012.0,41.0,2.0,,1540,48254546,K.

1542,"Background: This study explored how married women perceive situations which create family conflicts and lead to different forms of violence in urban Pakistan. In addition, it examines perceptions of consequences of violence, their adverse health effects, and how women resist violence within marital life. Methods: Five focus group discussions were conducted with 28 women in Karachi. Purposive sampling, aiming for variety in age, employment status, education, and socioeconomic status, was employed. The focus group discussions were conducted in Urdu and translated into English. Manifest and latent content analysis were applied. Results: One major theme emerged during the analysis, ie, family violence through the eyes of females. This theme was subdivided into three main categories. The first category, ie, situations provoking violence and their manifestations, elaborates on circumstances that provoke violence and situations that sustain violence. The second category, ie, actions and reactions to exposure to violence, describes consequences of ongoing violence within the family, including those that result in suicidal thoughts and actions. The final category, ie, resisting violence, describes how violence is avoided through women's awareness and actions. Conclusion: The current study highlights how female victims of abuse are trapped in a society where violence from a partner and family members is viewed as acceptable, where divorce is unavailable to the majority, and where societal support of women is limited.

1543,"The Special Programme of Research in Human Reproduction (HRP), co-sponsored by the UNDP, UNFPA, WHO, and the World Bank, is celebrating 40 years of activities with an expansion of its mandate and new co-sponsors. When it began, in 1972, the main focus was on evaluating the acceptability, effectiveness, and safety of existing fertility-regulating methods, as well as developing new, improved modalities for family planning. In 1994, HRP not only made major contributions to the Plan of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD); it also broadened its scope of work to include other aspects of health dealing with sexuality and reproduction, adding a specific perspective on gender issues and human rights. In 2002, HRP's mandate was once again broadened to include sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS and in 2003 it was further expanded to research activities on preventing violence against women and its many dire health consequences. Today, the work of the Programme includes research on: the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents, women, and men; maternal and perinatal health; reproductive tract and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS); family planning; infertility; unsafe abortion; sexual health; screening for cancer of the cervix in developing countries, and gender and reproductive rights. Additional activities by the Programme have included: fostering international cooperation in the field of human reproduction; the elaboration of WHO's first Global Reproductive Health Strategy; work leading to the inclusion of ICPD's goal 'reproductive health for all by 2015' into the Millennium Development Goal framework; the promotion of critical interagency statements on the public health, legal, and human rights implications of female genital mutilation and gender-biased sex selection. Finally, HRP has been involved in the creation of guidelines and tools, such as the 'Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use', the 'Global handbook for family planning providers', the 'Definition of core competencies in primary health care', and designing tools for operationalizing a human rights approach to sexual and reproductive health programmes.

1544,"The impact and meanings of homophobic violence on gay men's identities are explored with a particular focus on their identities as men and as gay men. Homosexuality can pose a challenge to conventional masculinities, and for some gay men, being victimized on account of sexual orientation reawakens conflicts about their masculinity that they thought they had resolved. Being victimized can reinvoke shame that is rooted in failure or unwillingness to uphold masculine norms. For some gay men, victimization therefore has connotations of nonmasculinity that make being a victim an undesirable status, yet that status must be claimed to obtain a response from criminal justice or victim services. Men who experience homophobic abuse are helped by accepting a victim identity, but only if they can quickly move on from it by reconstructing a masculine gay (nonvictim) identity. This process can be facilitated by agencies such as the police and victim services, provided they help men exercise agency in ""fighting back,"" that is, resisting further victimization and recovering. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012-11-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,20374,22,27,"Men as Victims: ""Victim"" Identities, Gay Identities, and Masculinities",0,false,10.1177/0886260512445378,,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2012.0,79.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The impact and meanings of homophobic violence on gay men’s identities are explored with a particular focus on their identities as men and as gay men.'}",1544,49630774,Peter W.

1545,"Background: Assault-related injury is a devastating consequence of violence and is a prominent cause of morbidity and mortality in young age. However, reliable data sources are scarce and there has been a paucity of studies examining possible predisposing factors on the incidence of assault-related injury. Method: Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of gender, indigenous status and remoteness to health services on sustaining assault-related injuries in patients aged 17 years and under by using data from the state-wide trauma registry in Queensland, Australia from 2005 to 2008. Results: A total of 282 assault-related injury cases were identified. Indigenous females were at the highest risk of sustaining assault-related injuries (odds ratio (OR): 15.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.17-28.6), followed by indigenous males (OR: 6.55, 95% CI: 3.60-11.9) and non-indigenous males (OR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.78-4.47). Males were at a significantly higher risk than females in the group aged 13-17 years (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.34-3.31). Living in a regional area was associated with a lower risk compared to major cities for non-indigenous people (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.44-0.78). Indigenous people were at higher risk of sustaining an assault-related injury than non-indigenous people in regional areas (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 3.14-7.42) and in remote areas (OR: 10.1, 95% CI: 2.64-38.69). Conclusions: The current study provides evidence of interaction effects among the predisposing factors. Identifying these factors is important to conduct effective preventive measures and trauma management plans focussing on high-risk groups of assault-related injuries in young age.

1546,"The purpose of this study was to examine the cross-cultural differences in the knowledge, definitions, and current training and educational experiences of domestic violence (DV) among third-year undergraduate nursing, dental, and medical students from two distinct universities in Northern Ireland and Jordan. A convenience sample of 774 undergraduate students was recruited. Analysis was based on gender, culture, and educational speciality, as seen through the integrated lens of a social ecological and feminist theory model. The results showed that a substantial percentage of all participants had never received any education or training on DV in their undergraduate programs. The majority of participants had good knowledge about DV, and half of the participants believed that DV is ""common"" in their respective countries. Significant gender and cultural differences in the definition of DV were also revealed, with Northern Irish students and female students in both cultures more likely to regard a range of behaviors as a form of DV. The research findings suggest several potential directions for change, emphasizing the importance of establishing a systematic evidence-based multidisciplinary and interagency approach to teaching and learning for student health care professionals on the topic of DV in their undergraduate programs. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012-10-01,Journal,Article,SAGE Open,21100255401,2,2,"A cross-cultural comparative study of undergraduate health care professional students' knowledge, definitions, education, and training experience of domestic violence in Northern Ireland and Jordan",1,true,10.1177/2158244012464974,SAGE Publications Inc.,,2012.0,69.0,2.0,,1546,1401804647,N.

In this study we conducted in-depth interviews with patients regarding their reasons for the attempt. Subjects and Methods: Seventy Turkish immigrants admitted to the emergency unit of the Basel University Hospital after a suicide attempt were interviewed. Seventy Swiss suicide attempters, matched for age and sex, served as a comparator (case-control study). Results: Turkish immigrants showed high rates of suicide attempts. The gender ratio (women/men) was 2.2; 38.6% of all Turkish suicide attempters were women aged between 15 and 25 years. Most patients mentioned problems in their partnerships as the main reason for the suicide attempt (63% of Swiss and 54% of Turkish patients); 14% of the Swiss but none of the Turkish suicide attempters named social isolation as a cause; 9% of the Turkish patients reported 'threat of loss/rejection of status as refugee' as the main reason. Immigrants used analgesics more often, whilst Swiss patients tended to favour benzodiazepines.

There are many problems in comparing data from different surveys, some of which are discussed in this paper. This paper takes the (controversial) approach of assuming findings from different surveys can be compared with each other, despite problems such as different question wording in different surveys. If this approach is accepted, it may help researchers identify which parts of the world have the worst problems of GBV.

1551,"Although reducing HIV risk is a primary motive for the design of HIV prevention interventions, the goals of the clients may be very different. Social theories of gender suggest that women, who often seek to resolve social and relational problems, may see HIV-prevention counseling as a mean of resolving partner violence. In contrast, men, who often worry about their physical strength, may seek to enroll in HIV-prevention programs when they experience physical symptoms unrelated to HIV. An unobtrusive study was conducted to observe enrollment in HIV risk-reduction counseling after measuring partner-violence complaints (e.g., feeling threatened or being hit), emotional complaints (e.g., fatigue or anxiety), and physical complaints (e.g., cardiovascular or digestive symptoms). The sample was a group of 350 participants, 70% clients from a state-health department in North Central Florida and 30% community members. Consistent with predictions, complaints of partner violence had a positive association with enrollment in women but not in men, whereas complaints about physical health had a positive association with enrollment in men, but not in women. Emotional complaints did not predict enrollment in either gender group.

1552,"Gender-based violence is a key determinant of HIV infection among women in South Africa as elsewhere. However, research has not examined potential mediating processes to explain the link between experiencing abuse and engaging in HIV sexual risk behavior. Previous studies suggest that alcohol use and mental health problems may explain how gender-based violence predicts sexual risk. In a prospective study, we examined whether lifetime history of gender-based violence indirectly affects future sexual risk behavior through alcohol use, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a high-risk socio-environmental context. We recruited a cohort of 560 women from alcohol drinking venues in a Cape Town, South African township. Participants completed computerized interviews at baseline and 4 months later. We tested prospective mediating associations between gender-based violence, alcohol use, depression, PTSD, and sexual risk behavior. There was a significant indirect effect of gender-based violence on sexual risk behavior through alcohol use, but not mental health problems. Women who were physically and sexually abused drank more, which in turn predicted more unprotected sex. We did not find a mediated relationship between alcohol use and sexual risk behavior through the experience of recent abuse or mental health problems.

1553,"Objective: We estimate the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and illegal substance use in a national representative sample of adolescents. We also estimate how socio demographic characteristics, household environment and mental health are associated with substance misuse. Method: This is a cross-sectional study using data from the first Brazilian National Alcohol Survey, which gathered information on the use of psychoactive substances in 761 participants aged 14 to 19. years old. Weighted logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. Results: More than half of the adolescents interviewed were regular alcohol users and one out of ten were abusers and/or dependents. Older male adolescents living in urban areas were more likely to present alcohol related disorders and to smoke. Age had an inverse association with illegal substance use. Smokers and those using illegal substances were more likely to report domestic violence while those with alcohol abuse/dependence were more likely to have depression. Conclusions: The high prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and illicit substance consumption among Brazilian adolescents is staggering. Young males with mood disorders from urban areas are more at risk of developing alcohol disorders while illegal drug use is highly associated to household dysfunction in early life.

1555,"OBJECTIVE: Leverage an experimental study to determine whether gender or recent crime victimization modify the mental health effects of moving to low-poverty neighborhoods. METHODS: The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study randomized low-income families in public housing to an intervention arm receiving vouchers to subsidize rental housing in lower-poverty neighborhoods or to controls receiving no voucher. We examined 3 outcomes 4 to 7 years after randomization, among youth aged 5 to 16 years at baseline (n = 2829): lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), psychological distress (K6), and Behavior Problems Index (BPI). Treatment effect modification by gender and family's baseline report of recent violent crime victimization was tested via interactions in covariate-adjusted intent-to-treat and instrumental variable adherence-adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Gender and crime victimization significantly modified treatment effects on distress and BPI (P < .10). Female adolescents in families without crime victimization benefited from MTO treatment, for all outcomes (Distress B = -0.19, P = .008; BPI B = -0.13, P = .06; MDD B = -0.036, P = .03). Male adolescents in intervention families experiencing crime victimization had worse distress (B = 0.24, P = .004), more behavior problems (B = 0.30, P < .001), and nonsignificantly higher MDD (B = 0.022, P = .16) versus controls. Other subgroups experienced no effect of MTO treatment. Instrumental variable estimates were similar but larger.

This article is a commentary on Dixon, Archer, & Graham-Kevan's (2012) critique of the Respect position statement on gender, which concluded by calling for abandoning either Respect or the Respect accreditation system. Methods. The article starts by providing some factual information about Respect and about the accreditation system mentioned in Dixon et al. It then picks up on five specific aspects of the discussion: research notions, prevalence, homicide, the relevance of gender to work on intimate partner violence, and our work to support male victims. Results. Dixon et al. critique one document in order to call for the abandonment of a system of accreditation which is not connected to that document. Dixon et al. ignored other relevant research (such as that on partner homicide) and practice evidence that contradicts their assertions. This includes ignoring the existence of Respect's work with male victims, including running the male victims helpline. Conclusions. Respect work is informed by knowledge and experience from research and practice. There is substantial evidence from research to support the position statement on gender.

The theoretical factors of the drivers are personality factor, socio-psychological factor, and alcohol-related behavioral risk factor. We utilized national survey data from 1007 respondents consisting of 703 males and 304 females aged 20-66 collected by Korean Institute of Criminology (KIC) to test our theorized model.

Results: The implementation of the OSCC model differed between hospital settings, with practise being influenced by organisational systems and constraints. Health providers generally tried to offer care to abused women, but they are not fully supported within their facility due to lack of training, time constraints, limited allocated budget, or lack of referral system to external support services. Non-specialised hospitals in both States struggled with a scarcity of specialised staff and limited referral options for abused women. Despite these challenges, even in more resource-constrained settings staff who took the initiative found it was possible to adapt to provide some level of OSCC services, such as referring women to local NGOs or community support groups, or training nurses to offer basic counselling. Conclusions: The national implementation of OSCC provides a potentially important source of support for women experiencing violence. Our findings confirm that pilot interventions for health sector responses to gender based violence can be scaled up only when there is a sound health infrastructure in place - in other words a supportive health system. Furthermore, the successful replication of the OSCC model in other similar settings requires that the model - and the system supporting it - needs to be flexible enough to allow adaptation of the service model to different types of facilities and levels of care, and to available resources and thus better support providers committed to delivering care to abused women. © 2012 Colombini et al.",2012-08-13,Journal,Article,BMC Public Health,19621,42,12,An integrated health sector response to violence against women in Malaysia: Lessons for supporting scale up,1,true,10.1186/1471-2458-12-548,,BMC Public Health,2012.0,55.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'The findings confirm that pilot interventions for health sector responses to gender based violence can be scaled up only when there is a sound health infrastructure in place – in other words a supportive health system.'}",1558,39092804,M.

1560,"Introduction: The purposes of this study were to assess the extent to which latent trajectories of female intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization exist; and, if so, use negative childhood experiences to predict trajectory membership. Methods: We collected data from 1,575 women at 5 time-points regarding experiences during adolescence and their 4 years of college. We used latent class growth analysis to fit a series of person-centered, longitudinal models ranging from 1 to 5 trajectories. Once the best-fitting model was selected, we used negative childhood experience variables - sexual abuse, physical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence - to predict most-likely trajectory membership via multinomial logistic regression. Results: A 5-trajectory model best fit the data both statistically and in terms of interpretability. The trajectories across time were interpreted as low or no IPV, low to moderate IPV, moderate to low IPV, high to moderate IPV, and high and increasing IPV, respectively. Negative childhood experiences differentiated trajectory membership, somewhat, with childhood sexual abuse as a consistent predictor of membership in elevated IPV trajectories.

1561,"Historically, the political context of partner physical aggression policy and research has focused on protection of physically victimized women and mandated interventions for male batterers. This emphasis is understandable when one considers the injuries and deaths of women by men. However, physical aggression against partners among teens is a very different phenomenon than battering. Intimate partner violence (IPV) in the form of physical aggression, the focus of this review, often starts in junior high school, and approximately 35% of male and female senior high school students report engaging in IPV. The specific trajectory of IPV varies by sample, but IPV appears to decrease in the late teens or early 20s. IPV is generally reported by both males and females, and not attributable to self-defense. IPV is significantly stable in couples who remain together, but stability appears lower if partners change. Given the importance of physical aggression by both males and females, prevention and early intervention programs need to address relationship factors, and targeted prevention and early intervention would be prudent with young high-risk couples. Decades of intervention programs for batterers have not proven very successful, and IPV appears easier to prevent than treat. Thus, emphasis on prevention of IPV seems both timely and promising. This review is intended for diverse audiences including educational administrators, policy makers, and researchers. It reviews issues such as who and when to target for IPV prevention programs, and it summarizes data relevant to these issues. © 2011 Society for Prevention Research.",2012-08-01,Journal,Review,Prevention Science,23019,78,13,Prevention of Partner Violence by Focusing on Behaviors of Both Young Males and Females,0,false,10.1007/s11121-011-0237-2,,Prevention Science,2012.0,94.0,10.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Intimate partner violence in the form of physical aggression, the focus of this review, often starts in junior high school, and approximately 35% of male and female senior high school students report engaging in IPV.'}",1561,84378697,K.

1562,"This paper describes the setting up and the first year of running of an innovative outreach service for adolescents on the edge of care that aimed at redressing family breakdown and preventing placements in the care system. It was a collaborative endeavour between social services and a child and adolescent mental health provision to facilitate the engagement of hard to reach young people and families that often presented high levels of risk. This article describes a distinctive model of applied psychoanalytic work with individuals, families and the networks of practitioners and agencies around the case. It focuses on the integration of two perspectives: the individual and the family on the one hand and the organisation on the other. Case examples illustrate how our psychoanalytic and developmental framework illuminated our understanding of frequently extreme acting out behaviour and parental difficulties in terms of underlying intergenerational trauma, which was often re-enacted. This framework also helped in understanding the difficulties that practitioners experienced and how these related to individual and family dynamics.

1563,"This article discusses conceptual issues and reviews knowledge about direct and buffering protective factors in the development of youth violence. Direct protective factors predict a low probability of violence, whereas buffering protective factors predict a low probability of violence in the presence of risk (and often interact with risk factors). Individual, family, school, peer, and neighborhood factors are reviewed. Heterogeneity of variables, measurement, contexts, study design, sample, and other characteristics limit generalizations. However, there were various evidence-based candidates for having a direct protective or buffering protective effect such as above-average intelligence, low impulsivity/easy temperament, enhanced anxiety, prosocial attitudes, high heart rate, close relationship to at least one parent, intensive parental supervision, medium SES of the family, sound academic achievement, strong school bonding, a positive school/class climate, nondeviant peers, and living in a nondeprived and nonviolent neighborhood. The probability of violence decreases as the number of protective factors increases (a dose-response relationship).

1564,"Sexual and relationship violence are two major public health issues that affect an alarming number of undergraduate students. As a result, many colleges and universities have protocols to serve victims of these forms of violence. Despite federal legislation stating that all students should have equitable experiences, current protocols and programs focus primarily on heterosexual students. College student victims of sexual and relationship violence who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender can face particular challenges, including disclosure of their sexual and gender orientations, and revictimization when seeking services. In recent years an increasing number of campuses have adopted bystander prevention strategies to address sexual and relationship violence. These strategies seek to engage community members in the prevention of sexual and relationship violence by training them to identify and safely intervene in situations where sexual or relationship violence is about to occur, is occurring, or has occurred.

Research highlighting potential factors that could improve the effectiveness of perpetrator programs is introduced, followed by a discussion of the rejection-abuse cycle, one attempt to incorporate current research into a more inclusive program. The rejection-abuse cycle identifies a pattern of perpetrator behavior, which links rejection, threat to self, defense against threat, and abuse.

1566,"Background Despite widespread apartheid-related human rights violations (HRV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) in South Africa, research investigating the influence of HRV on IPV perpetration is scarce. Methods This study analysed data from the South Africa Stress and Health Study, a cross-sectional survey conducted from 2003 to 2004 with 4351 South Africans examining public health concerns associated with apartheid. Analyses were restricted to men who had ever been married or had ever cohabited with a female partner. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between experiences of HRV and lifetime physical IPV perpetration. Results A total of 772 South Africa men met the study criteria (389 liberation supporters and 383 government supporters). Adjusted logistic regression analyses indicated that among liberation supporters, a significant association existed between experiencing major HRV (AOR 2.40, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.81), custody-related HRV (AOR 6.61, 95% CI 2.00 to 21.83), victimisation of close friends/family members (AOR 3.38, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.07) and physical IPV perpetration. Among government supporters, a significant association was observed between experiencing HRV (AOR 2.99, 95% CI 1.34 to 6.65) and victimisation of close friends/immediate family (AOR 5.42, 95% CI 1.44 to 19.02) and IPV perpetration. Conclusion This work indicates the importance of men's experiences with HRV with regard to IPV perpetration risk.

1567,"Background: Research on alcohol use among victims of physical and sexual violence has focused mostly on women and alcohol use disorders. It is also limited by the relative lack of consideration of victimization over the lifetime and of population data on both men and women. We critically examined associations between lifetime victimization and diverse past year alcohol use patterns and problems and whether these associations differ for men and women. Methods: Population data from the 2005 U.S. National Alcohol Survey (NAS11, n= 6919) are reported for 4256 adult men and women drinkers. Logistic regressions assessed associations between physical only or any sexual victimization experienced over the lifetime and past year heavy episodic drinking, drinking to intoxication, alcohol-related consequences and any alcohol use disorder. Models controlled for demographics and parental history of alcohol abuse and examined interactions of gender with victimization. Results: Associations between victimization experienced over the lifetime and all past year alcohol measures were significant for both men and women. These associations did not differ by type of lifetime victimization (physical only vs any sexual). The association of physical only victimization with drinking to intoxication was stronger for victimized vs non-victimized women compared to victimized vs non-victimized men. This gender difference ceased to be significant when specific victimization characteristics were controlled for.

1568,"© David Clark 2012. All rights reserved.This book is the first study to investigate both the relation between gender and violence in the Old Norse Poetic Edda and key family and contemporary sagas, and the interrelated nature of these genres. Beginning with an analysis of Eddaic attitudes to heroic violence and its gendered nature through the figures of Guòrún and Helgi, the study broadens out to the whole poetic compilation and how the past (and particularly the mythological past) inflects the heroic present. This paves the way for a consideration of the comparable relationship between the heroic poems themselves and later reworkings of them or allusions to them in the family and contemporary sagas. Accordingly, the study moves on to consider the use of Eddaic allusion in Gísla saga's meditation on violent masculinity and sexuality, assesses the impact of the Church on attitudes to revenge in family and contemporary sagas, and finally explores the scapegoating of women for male violence in the contemporary sagas. Although the Eddaic poems themselves present a complex and conflicting attitude to vengeance, revenge and other forms of violence are in later texts regularly associated with the past, often represented by Eddaic figures. Moreover, saga authors often attempt to construct a national narrative which shows moderation and peace-making as the only viable alternative to what is seen as the traditional destructive model of vengeance. Nevertheless, the picture the sagas present is far from uniform, rather being one of conflicting voices as the attractions of heroic violence for many prove difficult to resist. The book's thematic concentration on gender/sexuality and violence, and its generic concentration on Poetic Edda and later texts which rework or allude to it, enable a diverse but coherent exploration of both key and neglected Norse texts and the way in which their authors display a dual fascination with and rejection of heroic vengeance.",2012-05-24,Book,Book,"Gender, Violence, and the Past in Edda and Saga",21100373392,16,,"Gender, Violence, and the Past in Edda and Saga",0,false,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654307.001.0001,Oxford University Press,,2012.0,0.0,0.0,,1568,2117733144,D.

While most incidents of sexual assault in South Africa are interracial, narratives of interracial rape have dominated the national imaginary.

1571,"Intimate partner violence is a ubiquitous and devastating phenomenon for which effective interventions and a clear etiological understanding are still lacking. A major risk factor for violence perpetration is childhood exposure to violence, prompting the proposal that social learning is a major contributor to the transgenerational transmission of violence. Using an animal model devoid of human cultural factors, we showed that male rats became highly aggressive against their female partners as adults after exposure to non-social stressful experiences in their youth. Their offspring also showed increased aggression toward females in the absence of postnatal father-offspring interaction or any other exposure to violence. Both the females that cohabited with the stressed males and those that cohabited with their male offspring showed behavioral (including anxiety- and depression-like behaviors), physiological (decreased body weight and basal corticosterone levels) and neurobiological symptoms (increased activity in dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in response to an unfamiliar male) resembling the alterations described in abused and depressed women.

1574,"Introduction. This study sought to identify factors associated with health service utilisation by individuals with mental disorders in a Canadian catchment area. Methods. To be included in the study, participants had to be aged between 15 and 65 and reside in the study location. Data was collected randomly from June to December 2009 by specially trained interviewers. A comprehensive set of variables (including geospatial factors) was studied using the Andersen's behavioural health service model. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were carried out. Results: Among 406 individuals diagnosed with mental disorders, 212 reported using a mental health service at least once in the 12 months preceding the interviews. Emotional problems and a history of violence victimisation were most strongly associated with such utilisation. Participants who were middle-aged or deemed their mental health to be poor were also more likely to seek mental healthcare. Individuals living in neighbourhoods where rental accommodations were the norm used significantly fewer health services than individuals residing in neighbourhoods where homeownership was preponderant; males were also less likely to use services than females. Conclusions: Our study broke new ground by uncovering the impact of longstanding violence victimisation, and the proportion of homeownership on mental health service utilisation among this population. It also confirmed the prominence of some variables (gender, age, emotional problems and self-perceived mental health) as key enabling variables of health-seeking. There should be better promotion of strategies designed to change the attitudes of males and youths and to deal with violence victimisation. There is also a need for initiatives that are targeted to neighbourhoods where there is more rental housing. © 2012 Fleury et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012-04-03,Journal,Article,International Journal for Equity in Health,21461,50,11,Comprehensive determinants of health service utilisation for mental health reasons in a canadian catchment area,1,true,10.1186/1475-9276-11-20,,International Journal for Equity in Health,2012.0,121.0,8.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This study broke new ground by uncovering the impact of longstanding violence victimisation, and the proportion of homeownership on mental health service utilisation among this population and confirmed the prominence of some variables (gender, age, emotional problems and self-perceived mental health) as key enabling variables of health-seeking.'}",1574,144921057,M.

This study pilots the Dating Assertiveness Training Experience (DATE), designed to train young women in assertiveness skills for responding to sexual coercion and to provide them opportunities to practice these skills in a safe environment. Participants: One hundred thirty-nine female college students from a private university in the Southwest. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to DATE or a no-treatment control group. Sexual victimization and response to acts of sexual aggression were assessed prior to randomization, after intervention, and monthly for 3 months. Results: Women who completed DATE were less likely to be victimized than women in the control condition; those who were victimized were more likely to respond assertively.

1577,"Previous research has documented the practice of transactional sex in sub-Saharan Africa and its association with gender-based violence, gender inequalities and HIV risk. At the same time, it has been suggested that women may use transactional sex to obtain a greater sense of control over their lives and their sexualities, and to garner access to resources. The aim of this study was to better understand the practice of exchanging alcohol for sex in alcohol-serving venues in a township in Cape Town, South Africa. Data were collected between June 2009 and October 2010. Six venues were included and observations were conducted in each for four one-week periods over the course of a year. In-depth qualitative interviews included 31 women and 13 men whom interviewers had observed as regular venue customers. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 24 respondents to explore emerging themes. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Using a grounded theory approach, Atlas.ti was used to code transcripts, field notes, and analytical memos written about each document. Results revealed that alcohol was commonly used as a currency of sexual exchange in this setting, and both women and men understood that accepting alcohol from a man implied consent for sexual favors. Women reported a sense of agency in participating in the transactional sex dynamic, especially when they were able to manipulate it to meet their own ends without fulfilling the men's sexual expectations. At the same time, data revealed that the norm of transactional sex reinforced the undervaluing and commoditization of women. As identified elsewhere, transactional sex put both women and men at greater risk of HIV through multiple partners and inconsistent use of condoms, and the possibility of rape. Interventions are needed to address sexual risk behaviors and substance use within this context to prevent new HIV infections. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012-04-01,Journal,Article,Social Science and Medicine,18983,51,74,"""Because he has bought for her, he wants to sleep with her"": Alcohol as a currency for sexual exchange in South African drinking venues",2,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.12.022,,Social Science & Medicine (1967),2012.0,41.0,5.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Data revealed that alcohol was commonly used as a currency of sexual exchange in this setting, and both women and men understood that accepting alcohol from a man implied consent for sexual favors, and the norm of transactional sex reinforced the undervaluing and commoditization of women.'}",1577,5368564,M.

1578,"Background: Sexual offences are a global public health concern. Recent changes in the law in England and Wales have dramatically altered the legal landscape of sexual offences, but sexual assaults where the victim is voluntarily intoxicated by alcohol continue to have low conviction rates. Worldwide, students are high consumers of alcohol. This research aimed to compare male and female students in relation to their knowledge and attitudes about alcohol and sexual activity and to identify factors associated with being the victim of alcohol-related non-consensual sex. Methods. 1,110 students completed an online questionnaire. Drinking levels were measured using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Non-consensual sexual experiences were measured using the Sexual Experience Survey. Univariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken using chi square and backwards stepwise logistic regression respectively. Results: A third of respondents had experienced alcohol-related non-consensual sex. Male and female students differed in the importance they gave to cues in deciding if a person wished to have sex with them and their understanding of the law of consent. 82.2% of women who had experienced alcohol-related non-consensual sex were hazardous drinkers compared to 62.9% who drank at lower levels (P < 0.001). Differences existed between men and women, and between those who had and had not experienced alcohol-related non-consensual sex, in relation to assessments of culpability in scenarios depicting alcohol-related intercourse. A third of respondents believed that a significant proportion of rapes were false allegations; significantly more men than women responded in this way. Conclusions: Alcohol-related coerced sexual activity is a significant occurrence among students; attitudinal and knowledge differences between males and females may explain this. Educational messages that focus upon what is deemed acceptable sexual behaviour, the law and rape myths are needed but are set against a backdrop where drunkenness is commonplace. © 2012 Gunby et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012-03-21,Journal,Article,BMC Public Health,19621,19,12,Gender differences in alcohol-related non-consensual sex; Cross-sectional analysis of a student population,1,true,10.1186/1471-2458-12-216,,BMC Public Health,2012.0,82.0,3.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Alcohol-related coerced sexual activity is a significant occurrence among students; attitudinal and knowledge differences between males and females may explain this.'}",1578,5747544,Clare Gunby,3798500,Anna Carline,4006035,M.

1579,"Objectives: There is a lack of information on sexual violence (SV) among men who have sex with men and transgendered individuals (MSM-T) in southern India. As SV has been associated with HIV vulnerability, this study examined health related behaviours and practices associated with SV among MSM-T. Design: Data were from cross-sectional surveys from four districts in Karnataka, India. Methods: Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to examine factors related to SV. Multivariable negative binomial regression models examined the association between physician visits and SV. Results: A total of 543 MSM-T were included in the study. Prevalence of SV was 18% in the past year. HIV prevalence among those reporting SV was 20%, compared to 12% among those not reporting SV (p =. 104). In multivariable models, and among sex workers, those reporting SV were more likely to report anal sex with 5+ casual sex partners in the past week (AOR: 4.1; 95%CI: 1.2-14.3, p =. 029). Increased physician visits among those reporting SV was reported only for those involved in sex work (ARR: 1.7; 95%CI: 1.1-2.7, p =. 012).

Adherence to masculine norms was positively associated with participants' physiological fear/avoidant responses to a video of a man violating masculine gender norms by expressing vulnerable negative affect (crying, asking for help, showing affection for another man).

1582,"OBJECTIVES: Childhood gender nonconformity has been associated with poorer relationships with parents, but it is unknown if childhood gender nonconformity is associated with childhood abuse or risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in youth. METHODS: We examined whether gender nonconformity before age 11 years was associated with childhood sexual, physical, and psychological abuse and lifetime risk of probable PTSD by using self-report questionnaire data from the 2007 wave of the Growing Up Today Study (n = 9864, mean age = 22.7 years), a longitudinal cohort of US youth. We further examined whether higher exposure to childhood abuse mediated possible elevated prevalence of PTSD in nonconforming children. Finally, we examined whether association of childhood gender nonconformity with PTSD was independent of sexual orientation. RESULTS: Exposure to childhood physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, and probable PTSD were elevated in youth in the top decile of childhood gender nonconformity compared with youth below median nonconformity. Abuse victimization disparities partly mediated PTSD disparities by gender nonconformity. Gender nonconformity predicted increased risk of lifetime probable PTSD in youth after adjustment for sexual orientation. CONCLUSIONS: We identify gender nonconformity as an indicator of children at increased risk of abuse and probable PTSD. Pediatricians and school health providers should consider abuse screening for this vulnerable population. Further research to understand how gender nonconformity might increase risk of abuse and to develop family interventions to reduce abuse risk is needed.

1583,"Involvement by formal and informal social agents plays a major role in coping with the problem of partner violence. Based on data from the First National Israeli Survey of Family Violence, the present study attempted to answer whether the sex of the aggressor and the severity of his or her aggression affect formal and informal social involvement in partner violence. Data were obtained from a stratified probability sample of 2,544 women drawn from the general population in Israel. Findings show that the severity of aggression by both sexes affects informal social involvement similarly. But in regard to formal involvement, gender is of top importance, and only the severity of men's aggression influences formal social involvement. The findings indicate society's perceptions of partner violence and how it copes with the problem. These perceptions and their theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

1584,"Many communities across the world are chronically exposed to extreme violence. Responses of residents from a city and rural community in Southern Israel, both exposed to 7 years of daily mortar fire, were compared to residents from demographically, socio-economically and geographically comparable non-exposed control samples to examine protective factors and predictors of vulnerability to chronic war-related attacks. Samples from a highly exposed city (Sderot) and a highly exposed rural community region (Otef Aza), along with a demographically comparable comparison non-exposed city (Ofakim) and non-exposed rural community region (Hevel Lachish), were obtained in 2007 using Random Digit Dialing. In total, 740 individuals (81.8% participation rate) were interviewed about trauma exposure, mental health, functioning and health care utilization. In the highly exposed city of Sderot, 97.8% of residents had been in close proximity to falling rockets; in the highly exposed rural community region of Otef Aza, 95.5% were similarly exposed. Despite exposure to chronic rocket attacks, residents of Otef Aza evidenced little symptomatology: only one person (1.5%) reported symptoms consistent with probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and functioning levels did not differ from those of non-exposed communities. In contrast, posttraumatic stress (PTS), distress, functional impairment and health care utilization were substantially higher in the highly exposed city of Sderot than the other three communities. Lack of resources was associated with increased vulnerability among city residents; predictors of PTS across all samples included being female, older, directly exposed to rockets, history of trauma, suffering economic loss, and lacking social support.

1586,"Witnessing domestic violence (WDV) is a traumatic childhood experience associated with increased risk for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and reduced IQ scores. Specific affects of WDV on brain development have not been assessed. We sought to ascertain whether WDV was associated with abnormalities in white matter (WM) tract integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty subjects who witnessed domestic violence (16F/4M, mean age 22.4 ± 2.48. years) but were not physically or sexually abused were compared to 27 healthy controls (19F/8M, 21.9 ± 1.97. years) without exposure to trauma or Axis I and II disorders. DTI images were acquired with a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. Group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), covaried by age, gender, parental education, perceived financial sufficiency, IQ and degree of exposure to parental verbal aggression were assessed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), which projects FA values onto an alignment-invariant fiber tract representation. FA values in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus of left lateral occipital lobe were significantly lower (P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparison) in the WDV group. FA values correlated inversely with ratings of depression, anxiety, somatization, 'limbic irritability' and neuropsychological measures of processing speed. Measures of radial but not axial diffusivity were affected suggesting alterations in myelination. Degree of FA reduction was associated with duration of witnessing interparental verbal aggression and with exposure between ages 7 and 13. years. The inferior longitudinal fasciculus connects occipital and temporal cortex and is the main component of the visual-limbic pathway that subserves emotional, learning and memory functions that are modality specific to vision. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to childhood maltreatment is associated with alterations in fiber pathways that convey the adverse experience to frontal, temporal or limbic regions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2012-01-16,Journal,Article,NeuroImage,17495,140,59,Reduced fractional anisotropy in the visual limbic pathway of young adults witnessing domestic violence in childhood,2,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.09.033,,NeuroImage,2012.0,84.0,7.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to childhood maltreatment is associated with alterations in fiber pathways that convey the adverse experience to frontal, temporal or limbic regions.'}",1586,1875936,Jeewook Choi,2968575,B.

1587,"This article charts aspects of the engagement by formal law reform agencies with feminist ideas in the context of homicide law reform. This requires, of course, a concentration on violence against women. The article uses law reform work on the provocation defence to map the ways in which violence against women was an apparent driver of reform. It has Victorian law reform as its focus, and concentrates on the various manifestations of independent law reform agencies in Victoria - the Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC), and its two predecessor agencies, the Law Reform Commission of Victoria (LRCV) and the Law Reform Commissioner. The article explores the thesis that when law reform, at least homicide law reform, is driven by the social context in which the legal phenomenon of interest occurs, one is more likely to get progressive legal change than where reform is driven by legal categories. However, that social context had itself to be configured and the paper briefly traces the identification of 'domestic violence' as a social phenomenon. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",2012-01-01,Journal,Article,Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology,22761,7,45,Homicide law reform and gender: Configuring violence,0,false,10.1177/0004865812456852,SAGE Publications Ltdinfo@sagepub.co.uk,,2012.0,11.0,0.0,,1587,48553377,J.

Previous research suggests that antisocial and borderline personality disorder (PD) symptoms are associated with partner aggression.

This relationship was observed regardless of whether the participant's personality was described by a clinical interviewer, the participant themselves, or an informant chosen by the participant. Further, the relationship between borderline PD symptoms and self-reported partner aggression was moderated by gender such that women were driving the association.

The authors used meta-analytic procedures to evaluate current knowledge on the association between alcohol use and DVP among youth.

Alcohol use was measured in 3 main ways: 1) frequency or quantity of use, 2) frequency of heavy episodic drinking, or 3) problem use. Collectively, results support the conclusion that higher levels of alcohol use are positively associated with youth DVP. With fixed-effects models, the combined odds ratios for DVP for frequency/quantity, heavy episodic drinking, and problem use were 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 1.31), 1.47 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.85), and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.94, 2.80), respectively. This association persisted even after accounting for heterogeneity and publication bias. No studies were designed to assess the immediate temporal association between drinking and DVP. Future research should assess whether there are acute or pharmacologic effects of alcohol use on youth DVP. Furthermore, few studies have been hypothesis driven, controlled for potential confounding, or examined potential effect measure modification. Studies designed to investigate the youth alcohol-DVP link specifically, and whether results vary by individuals' gender, developmental stage, or culture, are needed. © The Author 2011.

1590,"Post-partum depression (PPD) is a mood disturbance that occurs in the weeks or months after child birth. PPD accounts for a substantial share of the global burden of disease; yet, gaps in research are especially high in Arab and Middle Eastern populations. Here, we review and offer a feminist critique of the scant biomedical research on PPD in Arab and Middle Eastern populations. Rates of PPD in some cases exceed those in Western populations, and even biomedical studies reveal that (1) poor support, (2) experiences of violence, (3) frustrated efforts to achieve norms of motherhood, and (4) specific features of patriarchal kinship are important contexts within which PPD occurs. Our review spurs a call for engendering research on PPD in this and other non-Western contexts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012-01-01,Journal,Review,Women's Studies International Forum,24359,8,35,Gender and postpartum depression in Arab Middle Eastern women,0,false,10.1016/j.wsif.2012.03.017,Elsevier Ltd,,2012.0,60.0,2.0,"{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A feminist critique of the scant biomedical research on post-partum depression in Arab and Middle Eastern populations is offered and a call for engendering research on PPD in this and other non-Western contexts is spurs.'}",1590,5771322,K.

1591,"This study aims to analyse the psychosocial profile of adolescent aggressors, victims, aggressors/victims and non-involved students, taking into account gender differences. The psychosocial profile of adolescents is defined in the present study according to the following adjustment indicators: overall self-esteem, satisfaction with life, depressive symptomatology, nonconformist reputation and community involvement. Participants were 1884 Spanish students (52% boys and 48% girls), age range 11 to 17 years (M = 13.7, SD = 1.4). Analysis of variance results indicate that adolescent aggressors/victims show the least adaptive psycho-social profile, while non-involved adolescents obtained the most adaptive profile among the four groups analysed. Also, we found significant differences between boys and girls in the psycho-social profile of aggressors, victims and non-involved students. However, aggressors/victims do not show gender differences in any of the variables analysed. We discussed the practical implications of these results. © 2012 by Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.",2012-01-01,Journal,Article,International Journal of Social Psychology,19700175790,38,27,A psychosocial profile of adolescent aggressors and school victims: Analysis of gender differences Un perfil psicosocial de adolescentes agresores y víctimas en la escuela: Análisis de las diferencias de género,0,false,10.1174/021347412800337906,Routledge,,2012.0,50.0,2.0,,1591,52020068,A.

1592,"The main aim of this preliminary study was to explore if Power and Gender model by Pratto and Walker (2004) constitutes an adequate theoretical tool for the analysis of dyadic power and violence against women in couples. According to this model, power differences between genders are built upon four bases: resources control, social obligations, sexist ideology and threat or use of force. Sixty four battered women were interviewed and asked to express their perceptions about her and his partner's power in three of these four bases. They also informed the frequency of psychological, physical and sexual episodes suffered in these relationships. Results showed that women perceived less power than their batterers in the three bases; these bases also correlated among them and those who had more power in one base was also more powerful in the others. Resources control by him and social obligations distribution in the couple significantly predicted psychological violence, but batterers' sexist ideology predicted physical violence. Finally, women gave different importance to the four power bases as obstacles when considering leaving her abusive partner. In conclusion, Power and Gender model should be investigated more in the field of intimate partner violence against women. © 2012: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.",2012-01-01,Journal,Article,Anales de Psicologia,19200156918,7,28,Perception of battered women on power asymmetry in their couples and its relation to violence: A preliminary study Percepción de las mujeres víctimas de malos tratos sobre la asimetría de poder en la pareja y su relación con la violencia: Estudio preliminar,1,true,10.6018/analesps.28.2.148901,Universidad de Murcia Servicio de Publicaciones,,2012.0,81.0,0.0,,1592,112903469,Jesús L.

1594,"This study aimed to identify factors underlying the risk of suffering abuse by a partner. A cross-sectional study of 622 female nurses was accomplished, randomly chosen at their place of work, at a hospital and health centers. We used a self-administered validated questionnaire that covered psychological, physical and sexual abuse, complemented by a set of socio demographic questions. The nurses at most risk of being abused by their partners were those who supported their family by their own salary (Odds Ratio: 2.41 [0.63-9.15]), those who lived with dependents (Odds Ratio: 4.27 [1.43-2.78]) and had a partner from social class IIIa (Odds Ratio: 2.62 [1.37-5.00]).

1595,"Young adults are more likely to experience intimate partner violence (IPV) than older adults. Little is known about the effect of confiding to others about sustained violence on the mental health of victims. The objective of this study was to explore the links between IPV, help-seeking behaviors and psychological distress by gender in a sample of 233 young couples. Our results indicate the frequency of sustained psychological violence, but not physical violence, was positively associated to distress. For women, seeking help from a greater number of confidents moderated the association between violence and psychological distress. For men, results showed that frequencies of physical and psychological violence were both positively linked to distress. However, unlike women, social support had no buffering effect on men's distress. These findings increase our understanding of the effects of social support on young adults' distress following episodes of IPV. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2012-01-01,Journal,Article,Journal of Family Violence,20369,38,27,Intimate Partner Violence and Psychological Distress among Young Couples: Analysis of the Moderating Effect of Social Support,0,false,10.1007/s10896-011-9402-4,,Journal of Family Violence,2011.0,61.0,3.0,,1595,2085667777,Isabelle Fortin,2150429,S.

1597,"Research on exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) among children and adolescents has rarely examined whether the gender of the perpetrator (e.g., mother-perpetrated vs. father-perpetrated IPV) elicits differential effects on male and female adolescents' mental health outcomes. This study examined whether exposure to severe IPV affected male and female youths' mental health internalizing (i.e., withdrawn, somatic, and depressed or anxiety problems) and externalizing (i.e., aggression) outcomes differently, as well as whether the effects of IPV exposure depended on the gender of the perpetrator of violence. Results indicated that female-only-perpetrated IPV had a detrimental impact on some of girls' internalizing mental health problems more so than on the internalizing mental health problems of males. Male-only-perpetrated IPV did not yield similar results, perhaps because the measure did not capture the larger context of violence between partners.

1598,"I argue that Gondolf, Johnson and Dekeseredy, in a recent issue of Aggression and Violent Behavior: A Review Journal, presented one sided arguments and misleading evidence for the role of gender in intimate partner violence (IPV). Johnson and Dekeseredy use only female victim samples and Gondolf only a male perpetrator sample. These methods generate spurious support for the gender paradigm. Better methodology; longitudinal and laboratory studies indicate that bilateral IPV, matched for level of severity is the most common form of IPV. Our policies should be directed towards this most common form not the relatively rare ""wife battering"". The stereotype of IPV proffered by the gender paradigm has obscured the dyadic patterns and psychological profiles of IPV so that a ""one size fits all"" approach has been the normative response. The future of IPV policy lies in prevention and in models that treat abusive families as coherent systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012-01-01,Journal,Note,Aggression and Violent Behavior,29451,61,17,The case against the role of gender in intimate partner violence,0,false,10.1016/j.avb.2011.09.002,,,2012.0,79.0,9.0,,1598,5002844,D.
