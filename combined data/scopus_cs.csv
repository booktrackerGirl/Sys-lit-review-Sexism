In order to address this problem, the sEXism Identification in Social neTworks (EXIST) challenge has been launched at IberLEF in 2021. In this international benchmark, sexism detection is formulated as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task with the aim to automatically identify sexism in social media content (binary classification) and to classify statements into different categories such as dominance, stereotyping or objectification. In this paper we present the contribution of team AIT_FHSTP for the EXIST challenge at IberLEF in 2022. To solve the two related tasks we applied two multilingual transformer models, one based on a multilingual BERT and one based on an XLM-RoBERTa architecture, and a monolingual (English) T5 model. Our approach uses two different strategies to adapt the transformers to the detection of sexist content: first, unsupervised pre-training with additional data and second, supervised fine-tuning with additional as well as augmented data. For both tasks the XLM-RoBERTa model, which applies a combination of the two strategies, outperforms the other two models. The best run for the binary classification (task 1) achieves a macro F1-score of 74.96% and scores the 26tℎ rank in the benchmark; for the multi-class classification (task 2) our best submission scores the 13tℎ rank with a macro F1-score of 46.75%. © 2022 2022 for this paper by its authors.

We apply transfer learning from a pre-trained multilingual DeBERTa (mDeBERTa) model and its zero classification to gain a better performance than BERT-based approaches. Lastly, we combine all 3 methods: mDeBERTa, zero classification, and BERT for majority vote. For Task 1, mDeBERTa is the best method with an accuracy of 76.09% and F1 of 76.08%. Meanwhile, an accuracy of 66.26% and F1 of 47.06% are the best results in Task2, when using majority vote. Our main contribution is to use DeBERTa and zero classification with designing only one classifier in sexism identification. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

For subtask A, with observations of models' overfitting on unimodal patterns, strategies are proposed to mitigate problems of biased words and template memes. For subtask B, we transform this multi-label problem into a multi-class one and experiment with oversampling and complementary techniques. Our approach places 2nd for subtask A and 5th for subtask B in this competition. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Semantics; Base models; Multi-label problems; Multi-modal; Multimodal models; Overfitting; Oversampling technique; Subtask; Textual information; Unimodal; Visual information; Visual languages","","","","","","","Chen Yen-Chun, Li Linjie, Yu Licheng, El Kholy Ahmed, Ahmed Faisal, Gan Zhe, Cheng Yu, Liu Jingjing, Uniter: Universal image-text representation learning, European conference on computer vision, pp. 104-120, (2020); Das Abhishek, Wahi Japsimar Singh, Li Siyao, Detecting hate speech in multi-modal memes, (2020); Duggan Maeve, Online harassment 2017, (2017); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Godoy Daniela, Tommasel Antonela, Is my model biased? exploring unintended bias in misogyny detection tasks, (2021); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Li Liunian Harold, Yatskar Mark, Yin Da, Hsieh Cho-Jui, Chang Kai-Wei, Visualbert: A simple and performant baseline for vision and language, (2019); Li Xiujun, Yin Xi, Li Chunyuan, Zhang Pengchuan, Hu Xiaowei, Zhang Lei, Wang Lijuan, Hu Houdong, Dong Li, Wei Furu, Et al., Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language tasks, European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 121-137, (2020); Loper Edward, Bird Steven, Nltk: The natural language toolkit, (2002); Lu Jiasen, Batra Dhruv, Parikh Devi, Lee Stefan, Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks, Advances in neural information processing systems, 32, (2019); Muennighoff Niklas, Vilio: state-of-the-art visio-linguistic models applied to hateful memes, (2020); Nozza Debora, Volpetti Claudia, Fersini Elisabetta, Unintended bias in misogyny detection, Ieee/wic/acm international conference on web intelligence, pp. 149-155, (2019); Tan Hao, Bansal Mohit, Lxmert: Learning cross-modality encoder representations from transformers, (2019); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2017); Vedaldi Andrea, Lenc Karel, Matconvnet: Convolutional neural networks for matlab, Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia, pp. 689-692, (2015); Velioglu Riza, Rose Jewgeni, Detecting hate speech in memes using multimodal deep learning approaches: Prize-winning solution to hateful memes challenge, (2020); Xu Kelvin, Ba Jimmy, Kiros Ryan, Cho Kyunghyun, Courville Aaron, Salakhudinov Ruslan, Zemel Rich, Bengio Yoshua, Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention, International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, (2015); Yu Fei, Tang Jiji, Yin Weichong, Sun Yu, Tian Hao, Wu Hua, Wang Haifeng, Ernievil: Knowledge enhanced vision-language representations through scene graph, (2020); Yu Zhou, Cui Yuhao, Yu Jun, Wang Meng, Tao Dacheng, Tian Qi, Deep multimodal neural architecture search, Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 3743-3752, (2020); Zhang Shengyu, Jiang Tan, Wang Tan, Kuang Kun, Zhao Zhou, Zhu Jianke, Yu Jin, Yang Hongxia, Wu Fei, Devlbert: Learning deconfounded visio-linguistic representations, Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 4373-4382, (2020); Zhu Ron, Enhance multimodal transformer with external label and in-domain pretrain: Hateful meme challenge winning solution, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

Multimedia automatic misogyny recognition consists of the identification of misogynous memes, taking advantage of both text and images as sources of information. The task will be organized around two main subtasks: Task A is a binary classification task, which should be identified either as misogynous or not misogynous. Task B is a multi-label classification task, in which the types of misogyny should be identified in potential overlapping categories, such as stereotype, shaming, objectification, and violence. In this paper, we proposed a system based on multitask learning for multi-modal misogynous detection in memes. Our system combined image features with text features to train a multi-label classification. The prediction results were obtained by the simple weighted average method of the results with different fusion models, and the results of Task A were corrected by Task B. Our system achieves a test accuracy of 0.755 on Task A (ranking 3rd on the final leaderboard) and the accuracy of 0.731 on Task B (ranking 1st on the final leaderboard). © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Character recognition; Classification (of information); Semantics; Text processing; Binary classification; Classification tasks; Combined images; Learning models; Multi-label classifications; Multi-modal; Multi-model fusion; Multitask learning; Sources of informations; Subtask; Learning systems","","","","","Google Jigsaw; PingAn Life Insurance; Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca; Universitat Politècnica de València, UPV","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the PingAn Life Insurance.

However, many in the network environment contain gender discrimination and aggressive information, which magnify gender stereotypes and gender inequality. Therefore, the filtering of illegal content such as gender discrimination is essential to maintain a healthy social network environment. In this paper, we describe the system developed by our team for SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification. More specifically, we introduce two novel systems to analyze these posts: a multimodal multi-task learning architecture that combines Bertweet for text encoding with ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) for image representation, and a single-flow transformer structure which combines text embeddings from BERT-Embeddings and image embeddings from several different modules such as EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). In this manner, we show that the information behind them can be properly revealed.

We address the two tasks: Task A consists of identifying whether a meme is misogynous. If so, Task B attempts to identify its kind among shaming, stereotyping, objectification, and violence. Our approach combines a BERT Transformer with CLIP for the textual and visual representations. Both textual and visual encoders are fused in an early-fusion fashion through a Multimodal Bidirectional Transformer with unimodally pretrained components.

One form of social media abuse is misogyny utterance. Misogyny is hatred directed at women. The number of misogyny utterances on social media keeps increasing. Detection of misogyny needs to be done to prevent misogyny utterances. This work examines misogyny on Twitter and proposes a method to detect it. The dataset used comes from tweets on social media Twitter related to women. The experiment in this work was done by comparing the effect of BERT Embedding for Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory. The performance of the methods tested was evaluated based on the resulting accuracy. This work showed that BERT with LSTM surpassed other methods with 86.15% accuracy. The model could outperform other methods because it understands more about the context of the data.  © 2022 IEEE.","bert embeddings; long short-term memory; misogyny detection","Brain; Convolutional neural networks; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Bert embedding; Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Freedom of speech; Logistics regressions; Misogyny detection; Performance; Social media; Speech detection; Embeddings","","","","","","","Sunarto T., kekerasan, dan perempuan, (2009); Perempuan K., Perempuan Dalam Himpitan Pandemi: Lonjakan Kekerasan Seksual, Kekerasan Siber, Perkawinan Anak, dan Keterbatasan Penanganan Ditengah Covid-19, (2021); Siapa Tokoh Terpopuler di Twitter pada 2021?, (2021); Caselli T., Novielli N., Patti V., Rosso P., EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian: Proceedings of the Final Workshop, (2018); Saha P., Mathew B., Goyal P., Mukherjee A., Hateminers: Detecting Hate speech against Women; Parikh P., Et al., Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pp. 1642-1652, (2019); Samghabadi N.S., Patwa P., Pykl S., Mukherjee P., Das A., Solorio T., Aggression and Misogyny Detection using BERT: A Multi-Task Approach; Bensoltane R., Zaki T., Comparing word embedding models for Arabic aspect category detection using a deep learning-based approach, E3S Web Conf., 297, (2021); Fersini E., Rosso P., Anzovino M.E., Overview of the Task on Automatic Misogyny Identification at IberEval 2018, (2018); Salsabila N.A., Winatmoko Y.A., Septiandri A.A., Jamal A., Colloquial indonesian lexicon, 2018 International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP), pp. 226-229, (2018); Ethayarajh K., How Contextual are Contextualized Word Representations?

Social media networks are rapidly developing. As a result, misogyny is becoming increasingly fashionable. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically classifying misogynistic Bengali messages on social media platforms. Several procedures have been taken to preprocess the data. Tf-Idf and Word Embedding with BERT are implemented so that computers can read text. Several machine learning-based models including Random Forest, SVM Polynomial kernel, SVM Signal kernel, and Adaptive Boosting have been tested to build a multi-class analyzer that identifies Misogynistic text in Bengali on social media. The models have been evaluated with the performance measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. With 62.61 percent accuracy, the SVM sigmoid kernel outperforms all other models. As per our knowledge, no earlier research has been conducted on the classification of Bengali misogynistic text; consequently, the current research is the most comprehensive to date.  © 2022 IEEE.","bert; machine learning; misogynistic text; multi-class; text classification","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Random forests; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Text processing; Bengalis; Bert; Machine-learning; Misogynistic text; Multi-class; Preprocess; Social media; Social media networks; Social media platforms; Text classification; Adaptive boosting","","","","","","","Kemp S., Digital 2022: Bangladesh; Ahluwalia R., Soni H., Callow E., Nascimento A., De Cock M., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets, EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 12, (2018); Fersini E., Nozza D., Rosso P., Ami@ evalita2020: Automatic misogyny identification, EVALITA, (2020); Ou X., Li H., Ynu-oxz@ haspeede 2 and ami: Xlm-roberta with ordered neurons lstm for classification task at evalita 2020, EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 2765, pp. 102-109, (2020); Datta A., Si S., Chakraborty U., Naskar S.K., Spyder: Aggression detection on multilingual tweets, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying, pp. 87-92, (2020); Alawneh E., Al-Fawa'Reh M., Jafar M.T., Al Fayoumi M., Sentiment analysis-based sexual harassment detection using machine learning techniques, 2021 international symposium on electronics and smart devices (ISESD).

In this paper, we describe the system proposed by the MilaNLP team for the Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI) challenge. We use Perceiver IO as a multimodal late fusion over unimodal streams to address both sub-tasks A and B. We build unimodal embeddings using Vision Transformer (image) and RoBERTa (text transcript). We enrich the input representation using face and demographic recognition, image captioning, and detection of adult content and web entities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use Perceiver IO combining text and image modalities. The proposed approach outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Embeddings; Image captioning; Image detection; Image modality; Late fusion; Multi-modal; Subtask; Unimodal; Web entities; Semantics","","","","","MONICA; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Politecnico di Torino, POLITO; European Research Council, ERC; Fondazione Cariplo, (2020-4288); Horizon 2020, (949944)","Funding text 1: This project has partially received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 949944, INTEGRATOR), and by Fondazione Cariplo (grant No. 2020-4288, MONICA).

The task has been organised in two related sub-tasks: the first one is focused on recognising whether a meme is misogynous or not (Sub-task A), while the second one is devoted to recognising types of misogyny (Sub-task B). MAMI has been one of the most popular tasks at SemEval-2022 with more than 400 participants, 65 teams involved in Sub-task A and 41 in Sub-task B from 13 countries. The MAMI challenge received 4214 submitted runs (of which 166 uploaded on the leader-board), denoting an enthusiastic participation for the proposed problem. The collection and annotation is described for the task dataset. The paper provides an overview of the systems proposed for the challenge, reports the results achieved in both sub-tasks and outlines a description of the main errors for a comprehension of the systems capabilities and for detailing future research perspectives. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Subtask; System capabilities","","","","","","","Agrawal Samyak, Mamidi Radhika, Lastresort at semeval-2022 task 5: Towards misogyny identification using visual linguistic model ensembles and task-specific pretraining, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Andreasen Maja Brandt, rapeable'and 'unrapeable'women: the portrayal of sexual violence in internet memes about# metoo, Journal of Gender Studies, 30, 1, pp. 102-113, (2021); Anzovino Maria, Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64, (2018); Arango Ayme, Perez-Martin Jesus, Labrada Arniel, Hateu at semeval-2022 task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Attanasio Giuseppe, Nozza Debora, Bianchi Federico, MilaNLP at semeval-2022 task 5: Using perceiver IO for detecting misogynous memes with text and image modalities, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Barnwal Shubham Kumar, Kumar Ritesh, Pamula Rajendra, IIT DHANBAD CODECHAMPS at semeval-2022 task 5: MAMI - multimedia automatic misogyny identification, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Basile Valerio, Bosco Cristina, Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Patti Viviana, Manuel Rangel Pardo Francisco, Rosso Paolo, Sanguinetti Manuela, SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63, (2019); Behzadi Mitra, Derakhshan Ali, Harris Ian, Mitra behzadi at semeval-2022 task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification method based on CLIP, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Cer Daniel, Yang Yinfei, Kong Sheng-yi, Hua Nan, Limtiaco Nicole, St John Rhomni, Constant Noah, Guajardo-Cespedes Mario, Yuan Steve, Tar Chris, Et al., Universal sentence encoder, (2018); Chen Lei, Chou Hou Wei, RIT boston at semeval-2022 task 5: Multimedia misogyny detection by using coherent visual and language features from CLIP model and data-centric AI principle, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Chen Tianqi, Guestrin Carlos, Xgboost: A scalable tree boosting system, Proceedings of the 22nd acm sigkdd international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 785-794, (2016); Chen Yen-Chun, Li Linjie, Yu Licheng, El Kholy Ahmed, Ahmed Faisal, Gan Zhe, Cheng Yu, Liu Jingjing, Uniter: Universal image-text representation learning, European conference on computer vision, pp. 104-120, (2020); Cordon Pablo, Diaz Pablo Gonzalez, Mata Jacinto, Pachon Victoria, I2c at semeval-2022 task 5: Identification of misogyny in internet memes, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Share of u.s. adults who use social media 2019, by gender, (2019); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Eagly Alice H, Mladinic Antonio, Gender stereotypes and attitudes toward women and men, Personality and social psychology bulletin, 15, 4, pp. 543-558, (1989); Rosso Elisabetta Fersini Paolo, Nozza Debora, Ami @ evalita2020: Automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 7th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian (EVALITA 2020), (2020); Emerson Guy, Schluter Natalie, Stanovsky Gabriel, Kumar Ritesh, Palmer Alexis, Schneider Nathan, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Farrell Tracie, Fernandez Miriam, Novotny Jakub, Alani Harith, Exploring misogyny across the manosphere in reddit, Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 87-96, (2019); Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Rosso Paolo, Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (ami), Proceedings of the 6th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian (EVALITA'18), (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Anzovino Maria, Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018, IberEval@ SEPLN, pp. 214-228, (2018); Fleiss Joseph L, Measuring nominal scale agreement among many raters, Psychological bulletin, 76, 5, (1971); Franks Mary Anne, Unwilling avatars: Idealism and discrimination in cyberspace, Colum.

However, evidence from empirical studies has generally been mixed. To examine this issue, we explored the degree to which sexualization in games was related to both well-being/body dissatisfaction and sexism/misogyny among players in two separate meta-analyses. Results revealed that sexualization in games was neither related to well-being/body dissatisfaction (r = 0.082, k = 10, n = 2,010, p = .066) nor sexism/misogyny (r = 0.040, k = 15, n = 15,938, p = .070). Better designed studies, and those that showed less evidence for researcher expectancy effects (for sexism/misogyny outcomes), tended to find less evidence for effects. As appears commonly in other realms of media effects, the evidence is weak that sexualized games influence player attitudes and behavior. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Mental health; Sexism; Sexualization; Video games","Body image; Empirical studies; Image problem; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Public interest; Sexism; Sexualization; Video-games; Well being; article; body dissatisfaction; human; human experiment; mental health; meta analysis; observer bias; outcome assessment; sexism; video game; wellbeing; Human computer interaction","","","","","Marsden Fund Council; Royal Society Te Apārangi, (MAU1804)","Supported by the Marsden Fund Council from Government funding, managed by Royal Society Te Apārangi ; MAU1804 .

This task is concerning the identification of misogynous content from a multi-modal perspective. Our participation is grounded on the combination of different feature sets within the same neural network. Specifically, we combine linguistic features with contextual transformers based on text (BERT) and images (BEiT). Besides, we also evaluate other ensemble learning strategies and the usage of non-contextual pretrained embeddings. Although our results are limited, we outperform all the baselines proposed, achieving position 36 in the binary classification task with a macro F1-score of 0.687, and position 28 in the multi-label task of misogynous categorisation, with an macro F1-score of 0.663. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Semantics; Binary classification; Classification tasks; Embeddings; Ensemble learning; F1 scores; Features sets; Learning strategy; Linguistic features; Multi-modal; Neural-networks; Embeddings","","","","","European Union NextGenera-tionEU/PRTR; European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Banco Santander; Universidad de Murcia","Funding text 1: This work is part of the research project LaTe4PSP (PID2019-107652RB-I00) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033.

Universities attempt to increase the numbers of women entering the programme, however, the number of women graduating from engineering continues to be less than 20%. This research sought to identify if there are still challenges experienced by female undergraduate and graduate students that contribute to the systemic issue of inequity throughout post-secondary degree programmes at a medium-sized institution through gender-nonspecific inquiries. A total of 372 students actively participated in a 21-question cross-sectional mixed-method survey. Three themes were identified relating to culture, gender and personhood. The built environment created physical barriers, while the attitudes of male peers, teaching assistants and professors led to negative experiences. Stereotypes and the lack of role models influenced one's sense of belonging and led to feelings of imposter syndrome. Attitudinal shifts are required to encourage the engagement and successful completion of women in post-secondary programmes. © 2022 World Institute for Engineering and Technology Education.

Previous studies have introduced corpora and natural language processing approaches for specific kinds of online abuse, mainly focusing on misogyny and racism. A current underexplored area in this context is religious hate, for which efforts in data and methods to date have been rather scattered. This is exacerbated by different annotation schemes that available datasets use, which inevitably lead to poor repurposing of data in wider contexts. Furthermore, religious hate is very much dependent on countryspecific factors, including the presence and visibility of religious minorities, societal issues, historical background, and current political decisions. Motivated by the lack of annotated data specifically tailoring religion and the poor interoperability of current datasets, in this article we propose a fine-grained labeling scheme for religious hate speech detection. Such scheme lies on a wider and highly-interoperable taxonomy of abusive language, and covers the three main monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Moreover, we introduce a Twitter dataset in two languages-English and Italian-that has been annotated following the proposed annotation scheme. We experiment with several classification algorithms on the annotated dataset, from traditional machine learning classifiers to recent transformer-based language models, assessing the difficulty of two tasks: abusive language detection and religious hate speech detection. Finally, we investigate the cross-lingual transferability of multilingual models on the tasks, shedding light on the viability of repurposing our dataset for religious hate speech detection on low-resource languages. We release the annotated data and publicly distribute the code for our classification experiments at https://github.com/dhfbk/religious-hate-speech. © 2022 Ramponi et al.","Abusive language detection; Natural language processing; Religious hate speech detection","Interoperability; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; 'current; Abusive language detection; Annotation scheme; Language detection; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Religious hate speech detection; Repurposing; Speech detection; Taxonomies","","","","","","","Akiwowo S, Vidgen B, Prabhakaran V, Waseem Z, Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms, (2020); Albadi N, Kurdi M, Mishra S., Are they our brothers?

Unprecedented levels of harassment came with the ever-growing internet usage as a means of worldwide communication. The goal of MAMI is to improve the quality of existing methods for misogyny identification, many of which require dedicated personnel, hence the need for automation. We experimented with five existing models, including ViLBERT and VisualBERT - both uni and multimodally pretrained - and MMBT. The datasets consist of memes with captions in English. The results show that all models achieved Macro-F1 scores above 0.64. ViLBERT was the best performer with a score of 0.698. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","F1 scores; Internet usage; Multi-modal; Multimodal models; Performance","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","Acknowledgments.

The improvement is credited to promoting core features of the construct over spurious artifacts that happen to correlate with it. Yet, over-relying on core features may lead to unintended model bias. Especially, construct-driven CAD-perturbations of core features-may induce models to ignore the context in which core features are used. Here, we test models for sexism and hate speech detection on challenging data: non-hateful and nonsexist usage of identity and gendered terms. On these hard cases, models trained on CAD, especially construct-driven CAD, show higher false positive rates than models trained on the original, unperturbed data. Using a diverse set of CAD-construct-driven and construct-agnostic-reduces such unintended bias. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Computer aided design; Core features; Data perturbation; False positive rates; Model bias; Model robustness; Speech detection; Test models; Speech recognition","","","","","Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond, DFF, (0171-00034B)","We thank the members of the Computational Social Science department at GESIS, the CopeNLU group, and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.

To explore how current automated hate speech detection approaches perform in detecting this type of hate, we evaluated the performance of two state-of-the-art detection tools, HateSonar and Google’s Perspective API, on a balanced dataset of 300 tweets, half of which are examples of misogynoir and half of which are examples of supporting Black women and an imbalanced dataset of 3138 tweets of which 162 tweets are examples of misogynoir and 2976 tweets are examples of allyship tweets. We aim to determine if these tools flag these messages under any of their classifications of hateful speech (e.g. “hate speech”, “offensive language”, “toxicity” etc.). Close analysis of the classifications and errors shows that current hate speech detection tools are ineffective in detecting misogynoir. They lack sensitivity to context, which is an essential component for misogynoir detection. We found that tweets likely to be classified as hate speech explicitly reference racism or sexism or use profane or aggressive words. Subtle tweets without references to these topics are more challenging to classify. We find that the lack of sensitivity to context may make such tools not only ineffective but potentially harmful to Black women. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media","Social networking (online); 'current; Detection approach; Detection tools; Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media; Speech detection; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Bailey A., On anger, silence, and epistemic injustice, Royal Instit Philos Suppl, 84, pp. 93-115, (2018); Bailey M., Trudy R., On misogynoir: citation, erasure, and plagiarism, Fem Med Stud, 18, 4, pp. 762-768, (2018); Barbour R.S., Checklists for improving rigour in qualitative research: a case of the tail wagging the dog?, BMJ, 322, 7294, pp. 1115-1117, (2001); Bonds A., Race and ethnicity ii: white women and the possessive geographies of white supremacy, Prog Hum Geogr, 44, 4, pp. 778-788, (2020); Cao R., Lee R.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12Th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 11-20, (2020); Chandra M., Pailla D., Bhatia H., Sanchawala A., Gupta M., Shrivastava M., Kumaraguru P., Subverting the Jewtocracy, Online Antisemitism Detection Using Multimodal Deep Learning, pp. 148-157, (2021); Collins P.H., Intersectionality as critical social theory, (2019); Crenshaw K.W., On Intersectionality: Essential Writings, (2017); Davidson T., Bhattacharya D., Weber I., Racial Bias in Hate Speech and Abusive Language Detection Datasets, (2019); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, 11, 1, (2017); Douglass S., Mirpuri S., English D., Yip T., They were just making jokes: ethnic/racial teasing and discrimination among adolescents, Cult Divers Ethnic Minority Psychol, 22, 1, (2016); Eddo-Lodge R., Why i’m no longer talking to white people about race, (2020); Elsherief M., Kulkarni V., Nguyen D., Wang W.Y., Belding E., Hate lingo: A target-based linguistic analysis of hate speech in social media, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 12, (2018); Epstein R., Blake J., Gonzalez T., Girlhood interrupted: The erasure of black girls’ childhood, (2017); Farrell T., Fernandez M., Novotny J., Alani H., Exploring misogyny across the manosphere in reddit, Proceedings of the 10Th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 87-96, (2019); Fereday J., Muir-Cochrane E., Demonstrating rigor using thematic analysis: a hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and theme development, Int J Qual Methods, 5, 1, pp. 80-92, (2006); Fitzsimons A., ) Intersectional identities and machine learning: Illuminating language biases in twitter algorithms, Hicss, pp. 1-10, (2022); Fortuna P., Nunes S., A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51, 4, pp. 1-30, (2018); Gomez R., Gibert J., Gomez L., Karatzas D., Exploring Hate Speech Detection in Multimodal Publications, (2019); Gorrell G., Bakir M.E., Greenwood M.A., Roberts I., Bontcheva K., Race and Religion in Online Abuse Towards UK Politicians.

We participated in both Subtasks, i.e. Subtask A: Misogynous meme identification, and Subtask B: Identifying type of misogyny among potential overlapping categories (stereotype, shaming, objectification, violence). The proposed architecture uses pre-trained models as feature extractors for text and images. We use these features to learn multimodal representation using methods like concatenation and scaled dot product attention. Classification layers are used on fused features as per the subtask definition. We also performed experiments using unimodal models for setting up comparative baselines.

This paper focuses on the problem of detecting and classifying both offensive language and Hate Speech using State-of-The-Art techniques in text classification. Pre-Trained transformer models have gained a reputation of astounding general language underst and ing that could be fine-Tuned for language-specific tasks like Text classification, We collected an Egyptian-Arabic dialect Custom dataset of about 8,000 text samples manually labelled into 5 distinct classes: (Neutral, Offensive, Sexism, Religious Discrimination, Racism), It was used to fine-Tune and evaluate multiple different Arabic pre-Trained transformer models based on different transformer architectures and pre-Training approaches for the Natural Language Processing downstream task of text classification. We achieved an average accuracy of about 96% across all fine-Tuned transformer models.  © 2022 IEEE.","Arabic Hate Speech; Natural Language Processing; Text Classification; Transformers","Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Text processing; Arabic dialects; Arabic hate speech; Egyptians; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Offensive languages; Text classification; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Abeer A., Tamer E., Quick and Simple Approach for Detecting Hate Speech in Arabic, Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Open-Source Arabic Corpora and Processing Tools, with A Shared Task on Offensive Language Detection, pp. 109-114, (2020); Mubarak H., Hassan S., Absar C.S., Emojis As Anchors to Detect Arabic Offensive Language and Hate Speech, (2022); Al-Hassan A., Al-Dossari H., Detection of Hate Speech in Arabic Tweets Using Deep Learning, (2021); Aldjanabi W., Dahou A., Al-Qaness M.A.A., Elaziz M.A., Helmi A.M., Damasevicius R., Arabic Offensive and Hate Speech De-Tection Using a Cross-Corpora Multi-Task Learning Model, Informatics, 8, 4, (2021); Onducted Google Survey, (2022); Kora R., Mohammed A., Corpus on Arabic Egyptian Tweets, (2019); Ahmed O., Tarek M.M., Tarek A., Comparative Performance of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Arabic Hate Speech Detection in OSNs, AICV 2020, AISC 1153, pp. 247-257, (2020); Absar Chowdhury S., Mubarak H., Abdelali A., Jung S., Jansen B.J., Salminen J., A Multi-Platform Arabic News Comment Dataset for Offensive Language Detection, Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 6203-6212, (2020); Ousidhoum N., Lin Z., Zhang H., Song Y., Yeung D., Multilingual and Multi-Aspect Hate Speech Anal-ysis, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing EMNLP-IJCNLP, pp. 4675-4684, (2019); Mubarak H., Darwish K., Magdy W., Abusive Language Detection on Arabic Social Media, Proceedings of the First Workshop on Abusive Language Online, pp. 52-56, (2017); Moatez E.L., Nagoudi B., Arabic Dangerous Dataset, (2020); Mikolov T., Sutskever I., Chen K., Corrado G., Dean J., Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and Their Compositionality, (2013); Pennington J., Socher R., Manning C., GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing EMNLP, pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Bojanowski P., Grave E., Joulin A., Mikolov T., Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., BERT: Pretraining of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Vaswani A., Et al., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Antoun W., Baly F., Hajj H., AraBERT: Transformer-based Model for Arabic Language Understanding, Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Open-Source Arabic Corpora and Processing Tools, with A Shared Task on Offensive Language Detection, pp. 9-15, (2020); Inoue G., Alhafni B., Baimukan N., Bouamor H., Habash N., The Interplay of Variant, Size, and Task Type in Arabic Pre-Trained Language Models, Proceedings of the Sixth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop, pp. 92-104, (2021); Abdul-Mageed M., Rahim Elmadany A., Moatez E., Nagoudi B., ARBERT & MARBERT: Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Arabic, Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, 1, pp. 7088-7105, (2021); Antoun W., Baly F., Hajj H., AAraELECTRA: Pre-Training Text Discriminators for Arabic Language Understanding, Proceedings of the Sixth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop, pp. 191-195, (2021); Conneau A., Khandelwal K., Goyal N., Chaudhary V., Wenzek G., Guzman F., Grave E., Ott M., Zettlemoyer L., Stoyanov V., Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale, (2022)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Faculty of Engineering - Ain Shams University; IEEE","20th International Conference on Language Engineering, ESOLEC 2022","12 October 2022 through 13 October 2022","Cairo","186070","","978-166545322-6","","","English","Proc.

[Methodology] The design of the study was observational and cross-sectional, with the participation of 487 eleventh-grade students from public secondary schools in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. Several instruments were applied for measuring hostile and benevolent sexism, perceptions of gender equality in mathematical abilities, mathematical self-efficacy and reasoning abilities. [Results] The results of the multilevel Bayesian random effects analysis confirmed that scores were higher for men than for women in measurements of self-efficacy, where the sex of the student body was a moderator in the relationship of mathematical self-efficacy and test scores. In addition, it was found that, depending on the sex of subjects, the association between self-efficacy and performance was also moderated by the educational center. [Conclusions] Among the conclusions, it is especially noteworthy that if the moderating effect of the educational center between self-efficacy and performance differs by sex, this implies that actions aimed at promoting self-efficacy will not have the same result in men and women, showing the need to develop differentiated interventions. © 2022 The authors.","Bayesian multilevel models; Mathematical self-efficacy; mathematics performance; sexism","","","","","","National Council of Rectors; Consejo Nacional de Rectores, CONARE, (723-B3-307)","Funding for this investigation was provided by the National Council of Rectors (CONARE), Costa Rica: Project “New ways of measuring old ideologies: The case of sexism and its implications in the academic field,” code 723-B3-307.","Plan de estudios de Bachillerato y Licenciatura en Enseñanza de la Matemática, (2017); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological review, 84, 2, pp. 191-215, (1977); Berkowitz R., School climate and the socioeconomic literacy achievement gap: Multilevel analysis of compensation, mediation, and moderation models, Children and Youth Services Review, 130, pp. 1-10, (2021); Berkowitz R., Glickman H., Benbenishty R., Ben-Artzi E., Raz T., Lipshtat N., Astor R.

People took advantages from the anonymous accounts spreading hatred and linguistic violence toward women, especially marginalized female groups. To indent this issue from a holistic lens and detect misogynistic aggression during this pandemic recession period, researchers specifically categorized abusive languages into several stratified groups, and utilized deep learning techniques to distinguish the differences between normal languages and unfriendly languages, with the creation of data-sets. To clarify the target, the paper will strictly target Spanish, English, and Hindi languages, and the social media users are concentrated on twitter and Facebook. Most of the research relies on systems of misogyny identification (AMI) and Natural Languages Processing technology (NLP). Besides, this paper will address external explanation and demonstration on Graph attention networks and Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. To interpret to what extent the misogyny issue can be explained by deep learning and relevant subfields, this paper will further provide a more insightful comprehension for the audience with understanding in depth. © 2022 IEEE.","deep learning; hate speech; machine learning; misogyny detection","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Hate speech; Learning approach; Learning techniques; Machine-learning; Misogyny detection; Neural-networks; Recession period; Social media; Convolution","","","","","","","Rahali A., Akhloufi M.A., Therien-Daniel A.-M., Brassard-Gourdeau E., Automatic Misogyny Detection in Social Media Platforms using Attention-based Bidirectional-LSTM, 2021 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), pp. 2706-2711, (2021); Al-Makhadmeh Z., Tolba A., Automatic hate speech detection using killer natural language processing optimizing ensemble deep learning approach, Computing, 102, 2, pp. 501-522, (2019); Canovas-Garcia M., Garcia-Diaz J.A., Valencia-Garci R., Automatic Misogyny Detection with Linguistic and Morphological Features in Spanish, Technologies and Innovation, CITI, pp. 30-42, (2020); Fortuna P., Nunes S., A Survey on Automatic Detection of Hate Speech in Text, ACM Computing Surveys, 51, 4, pp. 1-30, (2018); Garcia-Diaz J.A., Canovas-Garcia M., Colomo-Palacios R., Valencia-Garcia R., Detecting misogyny in Spanish tweets.

However, with the increase of people's use of social media, the dark side of social media has gradually attracted people's attention. The anonymity of social media has led many people to use it to harass, abuse, and attack others, with women being a common target group. Twitter, one of the world's most well-known social media platforms, is used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide to communicate and share information every day. Although the artificial intelligence system for detecting hate comments has been applied to the maintenance of social media, it is still difficult to distinguish hate speech against women. That is because misogynistic comments are often subtle, and the currently commonly applied detection methods do not sufficiently consider the contextual information of the text. Therefore, we propose a BERT-based misogyny detection method that can fully integrate contextual information and context to classify texts. The experimental results show that our method has significant improvement compared with other methods. © 2022 IEEE.","BERT; hate-speech detection; Machine learning; misogynia; natural language processing; social media","","","","","","","","Matias J., Johnson A., Boesel W.E., Keegan B., Friedman J., DeTar C., Reporting, reviewing, and responding to harassment on Twitter, SSRN 2602018, (2015); Duggan M., Online harassment 2017, (2017); Fallows D., How Women and Men Use the Internet, (2005); Manne K., Down girl : The logic of misogyny, (2018); Johnson A.G., The blackwell dictionary of sociology : A user's guide to sociological language, (2002); Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), pp. 57-64, (2018); Bosco C., Dell'Orletta F., Poletto F., Sanguinetti M., Tesconi M., Overview of the EVALITA 2018 Hate Speech Detection Task, EVALITA 2018-Sixth Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian, 2263, pp. 1-9, (2018); Fersini E., Anzovino M., Rosso P., Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018, 3rd Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages, IberEval, 3, 2150, pp. 214-228, (2018); Fersini E., Nozza D., Rosso P., Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (ami), EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, pp. 59-66, (2018); Hewitt S., Tiropanis T., Bokhove C., The problem of identifying misogynist language on twitter (and other online social spaces), Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 333-335, (2016); Shushkevich E., Cardiff J., 3rd Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages, pp. 255-259; Bakarov A., Vector space models for automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of Sixth Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language.

This has the potential to create conditions leading to several forms of bias that can synergize in negative feedback loops. For example, a lack of representation may induce bias toward default expectations for types of names or personalities. On the other hand, the same persons that fall out of default schemes are more easily prone to develop “impostor syndrome” feelings. Changing this attitude requires direct initiatives aimed at bringing forward the existence and the positive contributions by all those scientists belonging to minority groups at large. Geographical bias can be challenged by initiatives aimed at promoting the participation of the global scientific community as a whole. Here, funding agencies can play a direct role, for example, by increasing funding for international collaboration between rich and developing countries. Major global conferences should facilitate the participation of scientists from all parts of the world, especially as speakers, also by offering reduced fees or helping with travel grants. In this regard, a successful initiative funded by the Research Council of Norway is the conference series FemEx: Female Excellence Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, in which women comprised 80% of the keynote speakers. The three international meetings held so far offer a bold statement that there is no shortage of highly qualified female scientists in all fields of theoretical and computational chemistry to act as speakers in conferences. Similar initiatives directed to the LGBTQIA+ scientific community will bring greater visibility, facilitate networking, and strengthen identities and the sense of “belonging”. ; Funding text 2: T.A.S. is indebted to Madeleine Ramstedt (University of Umeå, Sweden) and Kaline Coutinho (University of São Paulo, Brazil) for insightful discussions on strategies to promote greater equity for the female and LGBTQIA+ communities in academia.

Besides offensive messages, memes are one of the main means of dissemination for such content. With these premises, the MAMI task was proposed at the SemEval-2022, which consists of identifying memes with misogynous characteristics. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem based on Mask R-CNN and VisualBERT that leverages the multimodal nature of the task. Our study focuses on observing how the two sources of data in memes (text and image) and their possible combinations impact performances. Our best result slightly exceeds the higher baseline, but the experiments allowed us to draw important considerations regarding the importance of correctly exploiting the visual information and the relevance of the elements present in the memes images. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Gender discrimination; Impact performance; Multi-modal; Offensive messages; Problem-based; Social media; Two sources; Visual elements; Visual information; Semantics","","","","","","","Barnum George, Talukder Sabera, Yue Yisong, On the benefits of early fusion in multimodal representation learning, (2020); Deshpande Tanvi, Mani Nitya, An interpretable approach to hateful meme detection, (2021); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Saibene Giulia Rizzi Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Gupta Agrim, Dollar Piotr, Girshick Ross, Lvis: A dataset for large vocabulary instance segmentation, (2019); He Kaiming, Gkioxari Georgia, Dollar Piotr, Girshick Ross, Mask r-cnn, (2018); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, (2021); LeCun Y., Haffner P., Bottou L., Bengio Y., Object recognition with gradient-based learning, Feature Grouping, (1999); Ka-Wei Lee Roy, Cao Rui, Fan Ziqing, Jiang Jing, Chong Wen-Haw, Disentangling hate in online memes, Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, (2021); Li Liunian Harold, Yatskar Mark, Yin Da, Hsieh Cho-Jui, Chang Kai-Wei, Visualbert: A simple and performant baseline for vision and language, (2019); Lin Tsung-Yi, Maire Michael, Belongie Serge, Bourdev Lubomir, Girshick Ross, Hays James, Perona Pietro, Ramanan Deva, Lawrence Zitnick C., Dollar Piotr, Microsoft coco: Common objects in context, (2015); Loshchilov Ilya, Hutter Frank, Decoupled weight decay regularization, 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019, (2019); Lu Jiasen, Batra Dhruv, Parikh Devi, Lee Stefan, Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks, (2019); Mozafari Marzieh, Farahbakhsh Reza, «l Crespi Noi, A bert-based transfer learning approach for hate speech detection in online social media, Complex Networks and Their Applications VIII, pp. 928-940, (2020); Muennighoff Niklas, Vilio: State-of-the-art visiolinguistic models applied to hateful memes, (2020); Peinelt Nicole, Nguyen Dong, Liakata Maria, Better early than late: Fusing topics with word embeddings for neural question paraphrase identification, (2020); Pramanick Shraman, Sharma Shivam, Dimitrov Dimitar, Akhtar Md Shad, Nakov Preslav, Chakraborty Tanmoy, Momenta: A multimodal framework for detecting harmful memes and their targets, (2021); Simonyan Karen, Zisserman Andrew, Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, (2015); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Velioglu Riza, Rose Jewgeni, Detecting hate speech in memes using multimodal deep learning approaches: Prize-winning solution to hateful memes challenge, (2020); Zhu Ron, Enhance multimodal transformer with external label and in-domain pretrain: Hateful meme challenge winning solution, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

In the SemEval-2022 Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI) challenge, we designed a system using two simple but effective principles. First, we leverage on recently emerging Transformer models pre-trained (mostly in a self-supervised learning way) on massive data sets to obtain very effective visual (V) and language (L) features. In particular, we used the CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) model provided by OpenAI to obtain coherent V and L features and then simply used a logistic regression model to make binary predictions. Second, we emphasized more on data rather than tweaking models by following the data-centric AI principle. These principles were proven to be useful and our final macro-F1 is 0.778 for the MAMI task A and ranked the third place among participant teams. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Semantics; Data centric; Language features; Logistic Regression modeling; Massive data sets; Simple++; Third places; Transformer modeling; Visual feature; Visual languages","","","","","","","Cer Daniel, Yang Yinfei, Kong Sheng-yi, Hua Nan, Limtiaco Nicole, St John Rhomni, Constant Noah, Guajardo-Cespedes Mario, Yuan Steve, Tar Chris, Et al., Universal sentence encoder, (2018); Chou H., Lee Y.H., Chen L., Xia Y., Chen W.T., CBB-FE, CamemBERT and BiT Feature Extraction for Multimodal Product Classification and Retrieval, Proc.

In our experiments for Task 1 we tested several models and decided to ensemble the three models that provided the best F1 score for this dataset. We achieved an accuracy of 78.83% for Task 1, ranking our run for Task 1 in the 6th place of the competition. For Task 2 we have used a hierarchical classification approach. First, a binary classification is performed to detect non-sexist tweets and then transformer-based models were used to categorize sexist tweets into the five proposed categories. For this task our system reached an accuracy of 64,65%, ranking in 11th place of the competition. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In this task, we experiment with architectures in the identification of misogynous content in memes by making use of text and image-based information. The different deep learning methods compared in this paper are: (i) unimodal image or text models (ii) fusion of unimodal models (iii) multimodal transformers models and (iv) transformers further pretrained on a multimodal task. From our experiments, we found pretrained multimodal transformer architectures to strongly outperform the models involving fusion of representation from both the modalities. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Learning systems; Semantics; Comparatives studies; Image modeling; Image-based; Learning methods; Learning models; Multi-modal; Text modeling; Transformer modeling; Unimodal; Unimodal image; Deep learning","","","","","","","Abburi Harika, Parikh Pulkit, Chhaya Niyati, Varma Vasudeva, Semi-supervised multi-task learning for multi-label fine-grained sexism classification, Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pp. 5810-5820, (2020); Anzovino Mary E., Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, NLDB, (2018); Barreto Manuela, Ellemers Naomi, The perils of political correctness: Men's and women's responses to old-fashioned and modern sexist views, Social Psychology Quarterly, 68, 1, pp. 75-88, (2005); ®t Dardenne Benoi, Dumont Muriel, Bollier Thierry., Insidious dangers of benevolent sexism: consequences for women's performance, Journal of personality and social psychology, 93, 5, pp. 764-779, (2007); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); He Kaiming, Zhang Xiangyu, Ren Shaoqing, Sun Jian, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); Jha Akshita, Mamidi Radhika, When does a compliment become sexist?

Using a single-axis framework neglects to recognize people's complex identities and how ableism overlaps with other forms of oppression including classism, racism, sexism, colonialism, among others. As a result, HCI and assistive technology research may not always attend to the complex lived experiences of disabled people. In this one-day workshop, we position disability justice as a framework that centers the needs and expertise of disabled people towards more equitable HCI and assistive technology research. We will discuss harmful biases in existing research and seek to distill strategies for researchers to better support disabled people in the design (and dismantling) of future technologies. © 2022 Owner/Author.","accessibility; assistive technologies; disability justice","Assistive technology; Disability justice; Disabled people; Future technologies; Single-axis; Social justice; Technology research","","","","","","","Abdelhadi A., Addressing the Criminalization of Disability from a Disability Justice Framework: Centring the Experiences of Disabled Queer Trans Indigenous and People of Colour, The Feminist Wire, (2013); Alkhatib A., To live in their utopia: Why algorithmic systems create absurd outcomes, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems., pp. 1-9, (2021); Asad M., Prefgurative design as a method for research justice, Pro-ceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 3, pp. 1-18, (2019); Bennett C.L., Brady E., Branham S.M., Interdependence as a Frame for Assistive Technology Research and Design, Proceedings of the 20th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS '18)., pp. 161-173, (2018); Bennett C.L., Gleason C., Klaus Scheuerman M., Bigham J.P., Guo A., To A., It's Complicated"": Negotiating Accessibil-ity and (Mis) Representation in Image Descriptions of Race, Gender, and Disability, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems., pp. 1-19, (2021); Bennett C.L., Keyes O., What is the point of fairness Disability, AI and the complexity of justice, ACM SIGACCESS Accessibility and Computing, 125, (2020); Bennett C.L., Peil B., Rosner D.K., Biographical pro-totypes: Reimagining recognition and disability in design, Proceedings of the 2019 on Designing Interactive Systems Conference., pp. 35-47, (2019); Berne P., Levins Morales A., Langstaf D., Invalid S., Ten principles of disability justice, WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly, 46, 1, pp. 227-230, (2018); Bradley D., Katz S., Sandra Bland, Eric Gar-ner, Freddie Gray: The toll of police violence on disabled Americans, (2010); Crenshaw K., Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Policies, University of Chicago Legal Forum, 1989, 1, pp. 139-167, (1989); James Edwards E., Monet Sum C., Branham S.M., Three Ten-sions Between Personas and Complex Disability Identities, Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems., pp. 1-9, (2020); Gerling K., Spiel K., A Critical Examination of Virtual Reality Technology in the Context of the Minority Body, (2021); Grieve-Smith A., Ten reasons why sign-to-speech is not going to be practical any time soon, (2016); Hamraie A., Fritsch K., Crip technoscience manifesto, Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience, 5, 1, pp. 1-33, (2019); Harrington C., Dillahunt T.R., Eliciting Tech Futures Among Black Young Adults: A Case Study of Remote Speculative Co-Design, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems., pp. 1-15, (2021); Harrington C.N., Borgos-Rodriguez K., Marie Piper A., En-gaging low-income African American older adults in health discussions through community-based design workshops, Proceedings of the 2019 chi conference on human factors in computing systems., pp. 1-15, (2019); Hendren S., all Technology Is assistive: Six design Rules on 'disability, Medium, (2014); Hofmann M., Kasnitz D., Mankof J., Bennett C.L., Living disability theory: Refections on access, research, and design, The 22nd International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility., pp. 1-13, (2020); What is Disability Justice, (2020); Jackson L., A community response to a #DisabilityDongle, (2019); Lewis T.A., Working Defnition of Ableism, (2021); Mankof J., Hayes G.R., Kasnitz D., Disability studies as a source of critical inquiry for the feld of assistive technology, Proceedings of the 12th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers and accessibility., pp. 3-10, (2010); Mingus M., Access Intimacy: The Missing Link, (2011); Finda Ogbonnaya-Ogburu I., Smith A.D.R., To A., Toyama K., Critical race theory for HCI, Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems., pp. 1-16, (2020); Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha L., Care work: Dreaming disability justice, (2018); Porter J.R., Sobel K., Fox S.E., Bennett C.L., Kientz J.A., Filtered Out: Disability Disclosure Practices in Online Dating Communities, Proc.

We explore model variations considering single and multiple languages both in the pre-training of the transformer and in the training of the downstream task to explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny through a transfer learning approach across multiple languages. That is, we train monolingual transformers with monolingual data and multilingual transformers with both monolingual and multilingual data. Our models reach state-of-the-art performance on all three languages. The single-language BERT models perform the best, closely followed by different configurations of multilingual BERT models. The performance drops in zero-shot classification across languages. Our error analysis shows that multilingual and monolingual models tend to make the same mistakes. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Transfer learning; Down-stream; Learning approach; Model variation; Multiple languages; Pre-training; Shot classification; State-of-the-art performance; Transfer learning; Zero-shot learning","","","","","","","Ahluwalia Resham, Shcherbinina Evgeniia, Callow Edward, Nascimento Anderson, De Cock Martine, Detecting misogynous tweets, Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages (IberEval 2018), co-located with 34th Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN 2018), pp. 242-248, (2018); Anzovino Maria, Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on Twitter, International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64, (2018); Bakarov Amir, Vector space models for automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for Italian.

We study two strategies to improve the results from last year's competition systems. First, we try to expand the criteria for the models to learn by augmenting the training examples via back-translation, whereas in the second approach, we augment the criteria at the classification stage by ensembling models pre-trained and fine-tuned over different languages. As a common step, we augment the training data by incorporating some examples where sexism is reinforced with hateful and/or offensive language and others examples where it is disguised by humor. Experimental results show that ensembling the prediction of different classifiers yields better results for sexism detection and classification tasks. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

It is a challenge formed of two tasks, aimed at identifying and categorizing sexism in texts, respectively. First of all, a review of language models in Spanish and English is carried out, identifying the best performing models in each language. Also, a review of similar tasks and challenges (sexism detection in texts) is done. Then, models are trained in two phases. The first phase is for selecting the best hyperparameters for each model, while in the second phase these hyperparameters are used to learn with more training data. Finally, a simple ensembling strategy is used, which takes into account the performance of each model over a small validation set. This is compared against building a pure Transformers Ensemble, showing that the simple ensembling strategy obtains higher results. This leaves for future work the task of making such Ensembles work at least as good as the naive ensembling strategy. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

However, with this much contribution, it also increases systematic inequality and discrimination offline is replicated in online spaces in the form of MEMEs. A meme is essentially an image characterized by pictorial content with an overlaying text a posteriori introduced by humans, with the main goal of being funny and/or ironic. Although most of them are created with the intent of making funny jokes, in a short time people started to use them as a form of hate and prejudice against women, landing to sexist and aggressive messages in online environments that subsequently amplify the sexual stereotyping and gender inequality of the offline world.

Due to the different karyotypes and the effects of X chromosome inactivation, females and males exhibit distinct methylation patterns on sex chromosomes; thus, it poses a significant challenge to normalize sex chromosome data without introducing bias. Currently, existing methods do not provide unbiased solutions to normalize sex chromosome data, usually, they just process autosomal and sex chromosomes indiscriminately. Results: Here, we demonstrate that ignoring this sex difference will lead to introducing artificial sex bias, especially for thousands of autosomal CpGs. We present a novel two-step strategy (interpolatedXY) to address this issue, which is applicable to all quantile-based normalization methods. By this new strategy, the autosomal CpGs are first normalized independently by conventional methods, such as funnorm or dasen; then the corrected methylation values of sex chromosome-linked CpGs are estimated as the weighted average of their nearest neighbors on autosomes. The proposed two-step strategy can also be applied to other non-quantile-based normalization methods, as well as other array-based data types. Moreover, we propose a useful concept: the sex explained fraction of variance, to quantitatively measure the normalization effect.  © 2022 The Author(s).

I suggest that we should extend this perspective by emphasising the role of technologies in promoting sexist attitudes in youth. A review of the literature suggests that hedonic technologies, such as videogames, video streaming and social media sites, have been often portrayed as delivering sexist content, and through cultivation, producing sexist attitudes and behaviours. Here, I build on cultivation, objectification, and ambivalent sexism theories, and hypothesise that (1) such effects exist in teenage users of videogames, video streaming services and social media, and that (2) such effects are more pronounced in males. Findings based on two secondary, large nationally representative datasets (n1= 3,300, n2= 3,946) of high school seniors do not, for the most part, support the hypotheses. The persistent non-significant and sometimes opposite to expectation findings are very informative, because they demonstrate that the overall role of modern hedonic technologies in driving sexism in teenagers may be limited or even positive, despite claims in popular media and findings of prior lab-based research. This is because the use time of videogames was only weakly associated with sexist attitudes and use time of social media and streaming services was associated with reduced sexist attitudes. The findings make first strides toward understanding the topic of IS content delivery and sexism and pave the way for more IS research on this important topic. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultivation theory; gender-based differences; Hedonic technologies; sexism; social media; videogames","Large dataset; Video streaming; Cultivation theory; Gender-based difference; Hedonic technology; Role of technologies; Sexism; Social media; Streaming medium; Technology use; Video-games; Video-streaming; adolescence; adolescent; article; expectation; gender bias; high school; human; information system; juvenile; male; social media; video game; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Ahuja M.K., Women in the Information Technology Profession: A Literature Review, Synthesis and Research Agenda, European Journal of Information Systems, 11, 1, pp. 20-34, (2002); Altenburger L.E., Carotta C.L., Bonomi A.E., Snyder A., Sexist Attitudes among Emerging Adult Women Readers of Fifty Shades Fiction, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 46, 2, pp. 455-464, (2017); Armstrong D.J., Riemenschneider C.K., Giddens L.G., The Advancement and Persistence of Women in the Information Technology Profession: An Extension of Ahuja's Gendered Theory of it Career Stages, Information Systems Journal, 28, 6, pp. 1082-1124, (2018); Barnes T.D., Beaulieu E., Saxton G.W., Sex and Corruption: How Sexism Shapes Voters’ Responses to Scandal, Politics, Groups, and Identities, 8, 1, pp. 103-121, (2020); Bates L., Misogynation: The True Scale of Sexism, (2018); Bavelier D., Green C.S., Pouget A., Schrater P., Brain plasticity through the life span: learning to learn and action video games.

Memes can also be used as tools to spread hatred and target women through degrading content disguised as humour. The task, Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI), is to detect misogyny in these memes. This task is further divided into two sub-tasks: (A) Misogynous meme identification, where a meme should be categorized either as misogynous or not misogynous and (B) Categorizing these misogynous memes into potential overlapping subcategories.

In parallel with the growth of social media, the code-mixed content for SA and H/T detection is also increasing creating a demand for the tools which efficiently analyze such content. However, SA and H/T content detection tasks in social media text are challenging due to the complex nature of the code-mixed text. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we - team MUCS, describe a learning model submitted to”Sentiment Analysis and Homophobia Detection of YouTube Comments in Code-Mixed Dravidian Languages” shared task at Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2022. The proposed methodology makes use of Dynamic Meta Embedding (DME) to train the Deep Learning (DL) based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to perform SA and detect H/T content in code-mixed Dravidian languages viz. Kannada, Malayalam, and Tamil. Models submitted to the shared tasks, obtained 6th, 4th, and 9th rank for Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada in Task A and 1st, 4th, 1st, and 5th rank for Tamil, English, Tamil-English, and Malayalam in Task B respectively. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Code-mixed; Dravidian Languages; Dynamic Meta Embedding; Homophobia; Sentiment Analysis; Transphobia","Behavioral research; Codes (symbols); Embeddings; Long short-term memory; Social networking (online); Code-mixed; Dravidian language; Dynamic meta embedding; Embeddings; Homophobia; Malayalams; Sentiment analysis; Service organizations; Social media; Transphobia; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Hande A., Priyadharshini R., Chakravarthi B.

For this, an online survey was used. First, we assessed whether sexism and violence justification affect awareness of gender-based cyberviolence. Second, this effect was evaluated considering the smartphone usage. Third, we studied differences in awareness of OGV according to gender, digital generation, and academic field of study. Fourth, we tested for multiple associations of attitudinal variables, smartphone usage, and sociodemographic variables with OGV. The study involved 453 young adults from the Andalucia region, Spain (Mage = 21.9, SD = 2.15; 64% women). The results showed that, with more sexist attitudes and normalization of violence, the limits regarding what constitute gender-based violence in digital media are more permissive (less awareness). Regarding smartphone use, when it became problematic, desensitization to cyberviolence against women and sexual and gender minorities increased. Multiple correspondence analysis revealed an observer profile, that is, a woman studying for a humanistic or healthcare career who does not believe in psychosocial sex differences, or that violence as a reaction is justified, and also does not support biological fatalism of sexism and violence. This observer also has high awareness of the cyber-behaviors that constitute OGV. In conclusion, this study provides key data for psychoeducational strategies aiming to increase awareness of gender-based cyberviolence. © The Author(s) 2022.","observers; online gendered violence; sexism; smartphone; violence justification","","","","","","","","Becker J.C., Swim J.K., Seeing the unseen: Attention to daily encounters with sexism as a way to reduce sexist beliefs, Psychology of Women Quarterly, 35, pp. 227-242, (2011); Capezza N.H., Homophobia and sexism: The pros and cons to an integrative approach, Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science, 41, pp. 248-253, (2007); Carli L.L., Bukatko D., Gender, communication, and social influence: A developmental perspective, The developmental social psychology of gender, pp. 295-331, (2000); Cepeda-Gonzalez I., Assessing the impact of gender education on sexism: Evidence from college students in Madrid, International Journal of Political Thought, 13, pp. 221-233, (2018); Choi J., Choi O., Kim J., Effects of adolescent smartphone addiction on cybersexual delinquency, Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal, 45, 5, pp. 819-831, (2017); Devine P.G., Plant E.A., Amodio D.M., Harmon-Jones E., Vance S.L., The regulation of explicit and implicit race bias: The role of motivations to respond without prejudice, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82, pp. 835-848, (2002); Diaz-Aguado M.J., (2002); Diaz-Aguado M.J., Martinez-Arias R., Martin-Babarro J., Bullying among adolescents in Spain.

Authorship attribution is a forensics tool that can help fight against these misconducts when applied to the small texts posted on these platforms. In this work, we exploit the recent developments in language models to tackle the problem of authorship attribution of small messages. Training one model per suspect, we devise a generative approach and compare it against a state-of-the-art discriminative method. Our results show that generative and discriminative features are complementary and can be leveraged to improve the results of current methods. Finally, we propose a strategy to use discriminative and generative models jointly and draw future research paths.  © 2022 IEEE.","Authorship Attribution; Deep Learning; Language Models; Multimedia Forensics; Social Media","Deep learning; Digital forensics; Social networking (online); Authorship attribution; Deep learning; Discriminative methods; Forensic tools; Language model; Large-scales; Multimedia forensics; Social media; Social media platforms; State of the art; Computational linguistics","","","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2017/12646-3, 2018/10204-6, 2019/21030-1)","Google® Latin America Research Awards (LARA) and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) DéjàVu #2017/12646-3, #2018/10204-6, and #2019/21030-1 funded this work. 1https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/","Chen A., The agency, (2015); Davey-Attlee F., Soares I., The fake news machine. inside a town gearing up for, (2020); Kirkpatrick D.D., Who is behind qanon? linguistic detectives find fingerprints, (2022); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 30, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Schuster M., Nakajima K., Japanese and korean voice search, Proc. of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

Detecting online sexism and encouraging better behaviours in society is a fundamental duty since the Internet is not safe from many of the misconducts against women. This paper explores a proposal by the Multiaztertest team that combines Bert and Roberta to fight discrimination against women. The best approach developed by this team in Spanish to the sexism identification task is based on pre-trained xlm-roberta-large and it has been fine-tuned only on the provided sexism identification labels EXIST dataset obtaining an accuracy of 0.7744 in the test data. Moreover, in English, the system uses pre-trained roberta-large which has been fine-tuned only on the provided sexism categorization labels EXIST dataset obtaining an accuracy of 0.8023 in the test data. Regarding the sexism categorization task, the best approach is based on pre-trained BETO in Spanish and pre-trained roberta-large in English and both have been fine-tuned on the provided sexism categorization labels EXIST dataset obtaining a macro-average F-measure of 0.4867 and 0.5337 respectively in the test data. Overall, the results confirm that these challenging tasks have been reasonably well addressed by the proposed tools. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

A popular task in the field is visual question answering (VQA), which aims to answer questions about images. However, VQA models have been shown to exploit language bias by learning the statistical correlations between questions and answers without looking into the image content: e.g., questions about the color of a banana are answered with yellow, even if the banana in the image is green. If societal bias (e.g., sexism, racism, ableism, etc.) is present in the training data, this problem may be causing VQA models to learn harmful stereotypes. For this reason, we investigate gender and racial bias in five VQA datasets. In our analysis, we find that the distribution of answers is highly different between questions about women and men, as well as the existence of detrimental gender-stereotypical samples. Likewise, we identify that specific race-related attributes are underrepresented, whereas potentially discriminatory samples appear in the analyzed datasets. Our findings suggest that there are dangers associated to using VQA datasets without considering and dealing with the potentially harmful stereotypes. We conclude the paper by proposing solutions to alleviate the problem before, during, and after the dataset collection process. © 2022 Owner/Author.","datasets; gender stereotype; racial stereotype; visual question answering","Learning systems; Dataset; Gender bias; Gender stereotypes; Human like; Machine learning models; Question Answering; Racial bias; Racial stereotype; Statistical correlation; Visual question answering; Fruits","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP22K12091); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR20D3)","Funding.

Existing research on technology-related abuse has primarily focused on describing the dynamics of abuse and developing solutions for this problem; we extend this literature by focusing on the security practices of advocates working “on the ground”, i.e. in domestic violence shelters and other support services. We present findings from 26 semi-structured interviews and a data walkthrough workshop in which advocates described how they support survivors. We identified a variety of intertwined emotional and technical support practices, including establishing trust, safety planning, empowerment, demystification, supporting evidence collection and making referrals. By building relationships with other services and stakeholders, advocates also develop networks of care throughout society to create more supportive environments for survivors. Using critical and feminist theories, we see advocates as sources of crucial technical expertise to reduce this kind of violence in the future. Security and privacy researchers can build on and develop these networks of care by employing participatory methods and expanding threat modelling to account for interpersonal harms like coercive control and structural forms of discrimination such as misogyny and racism. © USENIX Security Symposium, Security 2022.All rights reserved.","","Developing solutions; Digital security; Domestic violence; Emotional supports; Safety planning; Security Practice; Semi structured interviews; Support services; Technical support; Walkthroughs; Security systems","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R045178/1)","Many thanks to our participants, without whose ideas and dedication this work would not be possible.

Such speech usually originates in fringe communities, yet it can spill over into mainstream channels. In this paper, we measure the impact of joining fringe hateful communities in terms of hate speech propagated to the rest of the social network. We leverage data from Reddit to assess the effect of joining one type of echo chamber: a digital community of like-minded users exhibiting hateful behavior. We measure members' usage of hate speech outside the studied community before and after they become active participants. Using Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis as a causal inference method, we gauge the spillover effect, in which hateful language from within a certain community can spread outside that community by using the level of out-of-community hate word usage as a proxy for learned hate. We investigate four different Reddit sub-communities (subreddits) covering three areas of hate speech: racism, misogyny and fat-shaming. In all three cases we find an increase in hate speech outside the originating community, implying that joining such community leads to a spread of hate speech throughout the platform. Moreover, users are found to pick up this new hateful speech for months after initially joining the community. We show that the harmful speech does not remain contained within the community. Our results provide new evidence of the harmful effects of echo chambers and the potential benefit of moderating them to reduce adoption of hateful speech.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Joining; Social networking (online); Causal inferences; Digital communities; Harmful effects; Inference methods; Interrupted time; Online social medias; Online users; Spill over; Spillover effects; Time-series analysis; Time series analysis","","","","","USC-ISI; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (HR001121C0169, HR0011260595)","Funding for this work is provided through the USC-ISI Exploratory Research Award and through DARPA (Award # HR0011260595 and # HR001121C0169)","Almerekhi H., Investigating toxicity across multiple reddit communities, users, and moderators, Companion proceedings of the web conference, 2020, pp. 294-298, (2020); Baicker K., Svoronos T., Testing the validity of the single interrupted time series design, ERN: Hypothesis Testing (Topic, (2019); Baumgartner J., Zannettou S., Keegan B., Squire M., Blackburn J., The pushshift reddit dataset, CoRR, (2020); Cattaneo M.D., Idrobo N., Titiunik R., A Practical Introduction to Regression Discontinuity Designs: Foundations, Elements in Quantitative and Computational Methods for the Social Sciences, (2020); Cervone C., Augoustinos M., Maass A., The language of derogation and hate: Functions, consequences, and reappropriation, Journal of language and social psychology, 40, 1, pp. 80-101, (2021); Chandrasekharan E., Jhaver S., Bruckman A., Gilbert E., Quarantined| examining the effects of a community-wide moderation intervention on reddit, ACM Trans.

These memes although seemingly innocuous have transcended the boundary of online harassment against women and created an unwanted bias against them. To help alleviate this problem, we propose an early fusion model for the prediction and identification of misogynistic memes and their type in this paper for which we participated in SemEval-2022 Task 5. The model receives as input meme image with its text transcription with a target vector. Given that a key challenge with this task is the combination of different modalities to predict misogyny, our model relies on pre-trained contextual representations from different state-of-the-art transformer-based language models and pre-trained image pre-trained models to get an effective image representation. Our model achieved competitive results on both SubTask-A and SubTask-B with the other competing teams and significantly outperforms the baselines. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Semantics; Early fusion; Fusion model; Graph networks; Image representations; Language model; New forms; State of the art; Subtask; Target vectors; Image representation","","","","","","","Cer Daniel, Yang Yinfei, Kong Sheng-yi, Hua Nan, Limtiaco Nicole, St. John Rhomni, Constant Noah, Guajardo-Cespedes Mario, Yuan Steve, Tar Chris, Strope Brian, Kurzweil Ray, Universal sentence encoder for English, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations, pp. 169-174, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); He Kaiming, Zhang Xiangyu, Ren Shaoqing, Sun Jian, Deep residual learning for image recognition, 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 770-778, (2016); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Liu Shuying, Deng Weihong, Very deep convolutional neural network based image classification using small training sample size, 2015 3rd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR), pp. 730-734, (2015); Lu Jiasen, Batra Dhruv, Parikh Devi, Lee Stefan, Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks, Advances in neural information processing systems, 32, (2019); Minaee Shervin, Kalchbrenner Nal, Cambria Erik, Nikzad Narjes, Chenaghlu Meysam, Gao Jianfeng, Deep learning-based text classification: A comprehensive review, ACM Comput.

They often appear to be amusing, evoking and attractive to audiences. However, some memes containing malicious content can be harmful to targeted groups. In this paper, we study misogynous meme detection, a shared task in SemEval 2022 - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI). The challenge of misogynous meme detection is to co-represent multi-modal features. To tackle with this challenge, we propose a Multi-modal Multi-task Variational AutoEncoder (MMVAE) to learn an effective co-representation of visual and textual features in the latent space. Our goal is to automatically determine if a meme contains misogynous information and then identify its fine-grained category. Our model achieves F1 scores of 0.723 on the MAMI sub-task A and 0.634 on sub-task B. We carry out comprehensive experiments on our model's architecture and show that our approach significantly outperforms several strong uni-modal and multi-modal approaches.

However, recent research has revealed that the participation of minority groups in DSE activities is often hindered by different forms of bias and discrimination. Evidence of such behavior has been documented across almost all domains of DSE, including ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. However, little is known about the underlying design decisions of DSE platforms which allow certain demographics of the market to gain unfair advantage over others. To bridge this knowledge gap, in this paper, we systematically synthesize evidence from 58 interdisciplinary studies to identify the pervasive discrimination concerns affecting DSE platforms along with their triggering features and mitigation strategies. Our objective is to consolidate such interdisciplinary evidence from a software design point of view. Our results show that existing evidence is mainly geared towards documenting and mitigating issues of racism and sexism affecting platforms of ridesharing, lodging, and freelancing. Our review further shows that discrimination concerns in the DSE market are commonly enabled by features of user profiles and commonly impact reputation systems.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Digital discrimination; evidence-based design; sharing economy; systematic review","Commerce; Job analysis; Design strategies; Digital discrimination; Evidence-based designs; Ride-sharing; Sharing economy; Systematic; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Task analysis; Software design","","","","","","","Martin C., The sharing economy: A pathway to sustainability or a nightmarish form of neoliberal capitalism?, Ecological Econ, 121, pp. 149-159, (2016); Dillahunt T., Malone A., The promise of the sharing economy among disadvantaged communities, Proc.

Since pretraining deep models from scratch is a resource and data hungry task, our approach is based on three main strategies. We combine different state-of-the-art architectures to capture a wide spectrum of semantic signals from the multi-modal input. We employ a multitask learning scheme to be able to use multiple datasets from the same knowledge domain to help increase the model's performance. We also use multiple objectives to regularize and fine tune different system components. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Binary classification; Classification framework; Classification tasks; Embeddings; Generic frameworks; Multi-labels; Multi-modal; Pre-training; State of the art; Wide spectrum; Semantics","","","","","","","Ba Jimmy Lei, Kiros Jamie Ryan, Hinton Geoffrey E, Layer normalization, (2016); Carion Nicolas, Massa Francisco, Synnaeve Gabriel, Usunier Nicolas, Kirillov Alexander, Zagoruyko Sergey, End-to-end object detection with transformers, European conference on computer vision, pp. 213-229, (2020); Defazio Aaron, Jelassi Samy, Adaptivity without compromise: a momentumized, adaptive, dual averaged gradient method for stochastic optimization, (2021); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); He Kaiming, Zhang Xiangyu, Ren Shaoqing, Sun Jian, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); Kiela Douwe, Bhooshan Suvrat, Firooz Hamed, Perez Ethan, Testuggine Davide, Supervised multimodal bitransformers for classifying images and text, (2019); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Mathew Binny, Saha Punyajoy, Yimam Seid Muhie, Biemann Chris, Goyal Pawan, Mukherjee Animesh, Hatexplain: A benchmark dataset for explainable hate speech detection, (2020); Radford Alec, Kim Jong Wook, Hallacy Chris, Ramesh Aditya, Goh Gabriel, Agarwal Sandhini, Sastry Girish, Askell Amanda, Mishkin Pamela, Clark Jack, Et al., Learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision, International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 8748-8763, (2021); Ren Shaoqing, He Kaiming, Girshick Ross, Sun Jian, Faster r-cnn: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2015); Tan Mingxing, Le Quoc, Efficientnet: Rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks, International conference on machine learning, pp. 6105-6114, (2019); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2017); Vidgen Bertie, Derczynski Leon, Directions in abusive language training data, a systematic review: Garbage in, garbage out, Plos one, 15, 12, (2020); Wei Xi, Zhang Tianzhu, Li Yan, Zhang Yongdong, Wu Feng, Multi-modality cross attention network for image and sentence matching, Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 10941-10950, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

Based on photos, participants were asked how likely they thought the person depicted would be to use desktop computers, laptops and smartphones, and how much expertise they thought they would have with each technology. Furthermore, in order to see what impact this could have on systems being developed, we asked what design aspects would be important for the depicted person and whether they thought an adapted technology would be required. This study is based on an existing questionnaire, which was translated into German and extended to explore what impact this may have on system design. The results draw on 200 questionnaires from students in the first year of their Information and Communications Technology (ICT) studies at an Austrian university of applied sciences. Quantitative methods were used to determine if the perceptions varied significantly based on the age and gender of the people depicted. Qualitative analysis was used to evaluate the design aspects mentioned. The results show that there are biases against both older people and women with respect to their perceived expertise with computers. This is also reflected in the design aspects thought to be important for the different cohorts. This is crucial as future systems will be designed by the participants, and these biases may influence whether future systems meet the needs and wishes of all groups or increase the digital divide. © 2022 by the authors.","ageism; design of computer systems; perceptions of older people; sexism; user-adapted interaction","","","","","","","","Konig R., Seifert A., Doh M., Internet use among older Europeans: An analysis based on SHARE data, Univers.

In response to students being told to “go back to the kitchen” while gaming and reading as “female”, our team analyzed TikTok for videos hashtagged #gobacktothekitchen and #backtothekitchen across a one-year period. We also performed deeper analysis on comeback appeals eliciting or offering suggestions of responses to “Go back to the kitchen” and related misogyny and their responses. We found videos were typically created by “girl gamers” toward whom “back to the kitchen” misogyny had been directed, and who tagged them to assign networked meanings to their experiences, encapsulate their struggles for broad publics, and find validation with users sharing similar experiences. A salient theme in comeback appeal posts was performing positions of power to gain leverage over aggressors, while comments frequently offered support from other “girl gamers” and reinforcement of misogynistic stereotypes by male-identified aggressors.

The main risk factors are alcohol and tobacco consumption and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. HNSCC cases are divided into two subgroups, the HPV-negative (HPV−) and the HPV-positive (HPV+) which have different clinicopathological and molecular profiles. However, patients are still treated with the same therapeutic regimens. It is thus of utmost importance to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences to find new biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets towards personalized therapies. Epigenetic alterations are a hallmark of cancer and can be exploited as both promising biomarkers and potential new targets. E6 and E7 HPV oncoviral proteins besides targeting p53 and pRb, impair the expression and the activity of several epigenetic regulators. While alterations in DNA methylation patterns have been well described in HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC, accurate histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) characterization is still missing. Herein, we aim to provide an updated overview on the impact of HPV on the hPTMs landscape in HNSCC. Moreover, we will also discuss the sex and gender bias in HNSCC and how the epigenetic machinery could be involved in this process, and the importance of taking into account sex and/or gender also in this field. © 2022 by the authors.

Misogyny detection, even though it plays an important part in hate-speech detection, has not received the same attention. In this paper, we describe our classification systems submitted to the SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification. The shared task aimed to identify misogynous content in a multi-modal setting by analysing meme images together with their textual captions. To this end, we propose two models based on the pre-trained UNITER model, one enhanced with an image sentiment classifier, whereas the second leverages a Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN). Additionally, we explore an ensemble using the aforementioned models. Our best model reaches an F1-score of 71.4% in Sub-task A and 67.3% for Sub-task B positioning our team in the upper third of the leaderboard. We release the code and experiments for our models on GitHub. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Convolution; Speech recognition; Best model; Classification system; Convolutional networks;

Design/methodology/approach: The reconceptualization of the users’ condition is done by confronting HCI theories on users with a dialectical-existential perspective over human ontology. The research is presented as a conceptual paper that includes analyzing and revising those theories to develop a conceptual framework for the user oppression in HCI. Findings: Most HCI theories contribute to the user oppression with explicit or implicit ontological statements that denies their becoming-more or the possibility of users developing their handiness to the full human potential. Put together, these statements constitute an ideology called userism. Social implications: HCI needs to acknowledge its role in structuring oppression not just in sexism, racism, classism and ableism, but also the specific relation that pertains to HCI: userism. Similar to other fields, acknowledging oppression is the first step toward liberating from oppression. Originality/value: The user is an existential condition for HCI theories, yet few theories can explain in depth how this condition affects human development. From the dialectical-existential perspective, the user condition can be dehumanizing. Computers may intensify existing oppressions through esthetic interactions but these interactions can be subverted for liberation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Human-computer interaction; Ontological design; Oppression; Social justice informatics; Userism; Users","Human computer interaction; User profile; Condition; Human being; Interaction theory; Justice informatics; Ontological design; Oppression; Social justice; Social justice informatic; User; Userism; Ontology","","","","","","","Abilio L.C., Grohmann R., Weiss H.C., Struggles of delivery workers in Brazil: working conditions and collective organization during the pandemic, Journal of Labor and Society, 1, aop, pp. 1-19, (2021); Ahman H., Interaction as existential practice: an explorative study of Mark C.

We propose a bi-ensemble that uses a combination of two transformers ensemble, one built with models pretrained in Spanish and the other with models pretrained in English, both of them based either on the RoBERTa or the BERT architecture. The bi-ensemble method merges two previous approaches: ensembles with two architectures and ensembles with several trained models of the same architecture. Intuitively, this approach can take advantage of the knowledge of two different architectures and the robustness of ensembles to improve classification performance in this task. Our experimental results show that our approach is an effective method for the task.

Social media platforms are facing increasing pressure to work towards regulation of such content; and this has directed researchers in text mining to work towards hate speech identification algorithms. One such attempt is sexism detection for which mostly transformer-based text methods have been proposed. We propose a combination of byte-level model ByT5 with tabular modeling via TabNet that has at its core an ability to take into account platform and language aspects of the challenging task of sexism detection.

Adolescence is a crucial period, and some empirical studies have focused on the socialization of teenagers, proving that the socialization with the surrounding environment prevent sexist practices. In a previous work, we developed and tested the effectiveness of a mobile app, called Liad@s, with the goals of helping teenagers to prevent sexism and build healthy couple relationships. In this article, we carry out a study where (using a real situation) we compare the effectiveness of the Liad@s app in front of traditional interventions like a workshop about sexism for teenagers. Also, we evaluate the usability of the app and the user satisfaction with this application. In this study, our primary hypothesis is that the effectiveness of using our mobile application, in terms of knowledge acquired about sexism, would be at least as good as attending the workshop. Our secondary hypothesis is that the user satisfaction with the mobile application would be higher than the one with the workshop, causing a preference for the app. The results of this study show significant differences in learning appeared between gender and between the two different procedures when separately evaluating the data collected from both hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS) questionnaires. These results validate our primary hypothesis. Also, most of the population under study preferred the mobile app in front of the traditional workshop, validating also our secondary hypothesis.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We enriched the text modality description by incorporating word representations for each object present within the images. Images and text are then described at two levels of detail, globally and locally, using standard dimensionality reduction techniques for images in order to obtain 4 embeddings for each meme. These embeddings are finally concatenated and passed to a classifier.

Among these repurposed tools, one of the most popular is an unassuming social platform originally associated with guild meetings and gaming communities: Discord. Using a combination of software studies and design thinking, and drawing upon the authors’ experience designing and participating in Discord communities for academic purposes including conferences and classroom usage, this work examines the rhetorical disruption this games-designated platform potentially presents to institutional spaces and expectations. These disruptions and rhetorical disconnects manifest throughout the platform, involving choices in aesthetics, logistical elements of organization and threading (or the lack thereof), and assumptions in visual communication and available rhetorics. Even without greater gamification intention, such design elements and platform affordances can offer significant potential impact on the classroom, conference, or academic organization occupying this space. These changes are not without risks: gaming platforms carry with them mechanisms for decontextualized and intertextual racism, misogyny, and the transference of toxic community norms back to the classroom. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Discord; Educational technology; Games; Pedagogy; Social media","","","","","","","","Anderson E., Walker J., Kafai Y.B., Lui D., The gender and race of pixels: An exploration of intersectional identity representation and construction within minecraft and its community, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games, pp. 1-10, (2017); Arola K.L., The design of Web 2.0: The rise of the template, the fall of design, Comput.

In other words, many reject speciesism but accept what we might call ‘sentientism’. But do the reasons against species-ism yield analogous reasons against sentientism, just as the reasons against racism and sexism are thought to yield analogous reasons against speciesism? This paper argues that speciesism is disanalogous to sentientism (as well as racism and sexism). I make a case for the following asymmetry: (a) some non-humans clearly have interests, but (b) no non-conscious entities clearly have interests. This asymmetry, I argue, renders sentientism immune to the principal argument against speciesism. © 2022, Imprint Academic.

Based on a multisited ethnography of epigenetic knowledge production and its circulation across laboratories, clinics, and communities in the United States and Canada between 2016 and 2021, we build on Black feminist and science studies scholarship to convey the racial, gender, and epistemic consequences of epigenomic stories. We argue that these stories reflect how scientists position epigenetics as a way of providing biological evidence of social harms and shifting responsibilities from individuals to broader structures. Yet these stories also reflect the limits of epigenetic methods and models in effectively capturing and addressing lived experiences of oppression. Thus, while scientists envision epigenetics as a resource for social change, they do so in ways that privilege biological ways of knowing. In analyzing the values and power relations embedded in these practices, we argue that epigenomic stories reflect what is at stake socially, politically, and materially when we tell stories with science. We contend that efforts to mobilize epigenetic knowledge for social justice must therefore center marginalized peoples’ knowledge and experiences and address how racism and sexism shape science and its social consequences. © The Author(s) 2022.","epigenetics; feminist science studies; health; inequity; social justice; storytelling","","","","","","National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI, (R00HG009154)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research for this publication was supported by NHGRI grant R00HG009154: “Behavioral Epigenetics in Children: Exploring the Social and Ethical Implications of Translation.” The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.

The challenge organizers provide an English meme dataset to develop and train systems for identifying and classifying misogynous memes. More precisely, the competition is separated into two sub-tasks: sub-task A asks for a binary decision as to whether a meme expresses misogyny, while sub-task B is to classify misogynous memes into the potentially overlapping sub-categories of stereotype, shaming, objectification, and violence. For our submission, we implement a new model fusion network and employ an ensemble learning approach for better performance. With this structure, we achieve a 0.755 macro-average F1-score (11th) in sub-task A and a 0.709 weighted-average F1-score (10th) in sub-task B. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Binary decision; Ensemble learning; Ensemble learning approach; Ensemble systems; F1 scores; Modal models; Model fusion; Modeling architecture; Subtask; Train systems; Semantics","","","","","Security for Humans in Cyberspace; Natural Resources Wales, NRW","The work was supported by the PhD School ”SecHuman - Security for Humans in Cyberspace” by the federal state of NRW.","Chetty Naganna, Alathur Sreejith, Hate speech review in the context of online social networks, Aggression and violent behavior, 40, pp. 108-118, (2018); Dosovitskiy Alexey, Beyer Lucas, Kolesnikov Alexander, Weissenborn Dirk, Zhai Xiaohua, Unterthiner Thomas, Dehghani Mostafa, Minderer Matthias, Heigold Georg, Gelly Sylvain, Et al., An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale, (2020); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Gomes Heitor Murilo, Barddal Jean Paul, ­cio Enembreck Fabri, Bifet Albert, A survey on ensemble learning for data stream classification, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 50, 2, pp. 1-36, (2017); Huang Gao, Li Yixuan, Pleiss Geoff, Liu Zhuang, Hopcroft John E., Weinberger Kilian Q., Snapshot ensembles: Train 1, get M for free, 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, (2017); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Liu Yinhan, Ott Myle, Goyal Naman, Du Jingfei, Joshi Mandar, Chen Danqi, Levy Omer, Lewis Mike, Zettlemoyer Luke, Stoyanov Veselin, Roberta: A robustly optimized bert pretraining approach, (2019); Loshchilov I., Hutter F., Decoupled weight decay regularization, (2017); Lu Zhibin, Du Pan, Nie Jian-Yun, VGCNBERT: augmenting BERT with graph embedding for text classification, Advances in Information Retrieval, 12035, (2020); Mann H., Whitney D., On a test of whether one of two random variables is stochastically larger than the other, The annals of mathematical statistics, pp. 50-60, (1947); Onan Aytug, Korukoglu Serdar, Bulut Hasan, Ensemble of keyword extraction methods and classifiers in text classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 57, pp. 232-247, (2016); Paszke A., Gross S., Massa F., Lerer A., Bradbury J., Chanan G., Killeen T., Lin Z., Gimelshein N., Antiga L., Et al., Pytorch: An imperative style, high-performance deep learning library, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2019); Sabat Benet Oriol, Ferrer Cristian Canton, Giro-i Nieto Xavier, Hate speech in pixels: Detection of offensive memes towards automatic moderation, (2019); Simonyan Karen, Zisserman Andrew, Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, (2014); Torrey Lisa, Shavlik Jude, Transfer learning, Handbook of research on machine learning applications and trends: algorithms, methods, and techniques, pp. 242-264, (2010); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Velickovic Petar, Cucurull Guillem, Casanova Arantxa, Romero Adriana, Lio Pietro, Bengio Yoshua, Graph attention networks, (2017); Wang Ling, Zhang Chengyun, Bai Renren, Li Jianjun, Duan Hongliang, Heck reaction prediction using a transformer model based on a transfer learning strategy, Chemical Communications, 56, 65, pp. 9368-9371, (2020); Xu Kelvin, Ba Jimmy, Kiros Ryan, Cho Kyunghyun, Courville Aaron, Salakhutdinov Ruslan, Zemel Richard, Bengio Yoshua, Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention, (2016); Yao Liang, Mao Chengsheng, Luo Yuan, Graph convolutional networks for text classification, Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, pp. 7370-7377, (2019); Zhu Ron, Enhance multimodal transformer with external label and in-domain pretrain: Hateful meme challenge winning solution, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

However, for whatever reason it is noticeable that verbal misbehaviors, such as hate speech is now propagated through the social networks. One of the most popular social networks is Twitter which has gained widespread in the Arabic region. This research aims to identify and classify Arabic tweets into 5 distinct classes: none, religious, racial, sexism or general hate. A dataset of 11 K tweets was collected and labelled and SVM model was used as a baseline to be compared against 4 deep learning models: LTSM, CNN + LTSM, GRU and CNN + GRU. The results show that all the 4 deep learning models outperform the SVM model in detecting hateful tweets. Although the SVM achieves an overall recall of 74%, the deep learning models have an average recall of 75%. However, adding a layer of CNN to LTSM enhances the overall performance of detection with 72% precision, 75% recall and 73% F1 score. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Arabic NLP; Arabic tweets; Deep learning; Hate speech; Multiclassification; Social networks; Text mining","Deep learning; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Arabic NLP; Arabic tweet; Deep learning; Hate speech; Learning models; Misbehaviour; Multi-classification; Social network; SVM model; Text-mining; Support vector machines","","","","","Deanship of Scientific Research, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, DSR; Department of Sport and Recreation, Government of Western Australia, DSR; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Deanship of scientific research in King Saud University, for funding and supporting this research through the initiative of DSR Graduate Students Research Support (GSR).; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank Deanship of scientific research in King Saud University, for funding and supporting this research through the initiative of DSR Graduate Students Research Support (GSR).

Hateful content is often used to target a group of people based on ethnicity, gender, religion and other factors. The hate or contempt toward women has been increasing on social platforms. Misogynous content detection is especially challenging when textual and visual modalities are combined to form a single context, e.g., an overlay text embedded on top of an image, also known as meme. In this paper, we present a multimodal architecture that combines textual and visual features to detect misogynous memes. The proposed architecture is evaluated in the SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification challenge under the team name TIB-VA. We obtained the best result in the Task-B where the challenge is to classify whether a given document is misogynous and further identify the following sub-classes: shaming, stereotype, objectification, and violence. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Content detection; Multimodal architectures; Online users; Proposed architectures; Social media; Sub class; Textual features; Visual feature; Visual modalities; Semantics","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (812997); Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: This work has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 812997 (CLEOPATRA ITN).; Funding text 2: This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie grant agreement No. 812997 (CLEOPATRA ITN).","Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Gasparini Francesca, Erba Ilaria, Fersini Elisabetta, Corchs Silvia, Multimodal classification of sexist advertisements, Proceedings of the 15th International Joint Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications, ICETE 2018 - Volume 1: DCNET, ICE-B, OPTICS, SIGMAP and WINSYS, pp. 565-572, (2018); Gomez Raul, Gibert Jaume, ­s Gomez Llui, Karatzas Dimosthenis, Exploring hate speech detection in multimodal publications, IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV 2020, pp. 1459-1467, (2020); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Fitzpatrick Casey A., Bull Peter, Lipstein Greg, Nelli Tony, Zhu Ron, Muennighoff Niklas, Velioglu Riza, Rose Jewgeni, Lippe Phillip, Holla Nithin, Chandra Shantanu, Rajamanickam Santhosh, Antoniou Georgios, Shutova Ekaterina, Yannakoudakis Helen, Sandulescu Vlad, Ozertem Umut, Pantel Patrick, Specia Lucia, Parikh Devi, The hateful memes challenge: Competition report, NeurIPS 2020 Competition and Demonstration Track, 6-12 December 2020, Virtual Event/Vancouver, BC, Canada, volume 133 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pp. 344-360, (2020); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2020, NeurIPS 2020, (2020); Kingma Diederik P., Ba Jimmy, Adam: A method for stochastic optimization, 3rd International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2015, (2015); Lu Jiasen, Batra Dhruv, Parikh Devi, Lee Stefan, Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2019, NeurIPS 2019, pp. 13-23, (2019); Menini Stefano, Aprosio Alessio Palmero, Tonelli Sara, A multimodal dataset of images and text to study abusive language, Proceedings of the Seventh Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics, CLiC-it 2020, 2769, (2020); (2020); Pramanick Shraman, Dimitrov Dimitar, Mukherjee Rituparna, Sharma Shivam, Akhtar Md.

As a result, people from other demographic such as women and LGBTQ+ often encounter bias, sexism, and misogyny. Due to negative experiences, many women switch careers. Therefore, biases pose barriers to promote diversity and inclusion. To get benefits from diverse pools of talents and reduce the attrition rate of minorities, we need to identify the degree and effect of various biases and develop mitigation strategies. Therefore, my dissertation study aims at promoting diversity and inclusion among software development organizations by identifying the manifestation, magnitude, and frequency of various gender biases. For this purpose, I plan to investigate i) the effect of gender of the contributors in the code review process of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects, ii) the frequency of different dimensions of gender bias and their effect, and iii) develop a tool to identify sexist and misogynistic and derogatory (SMD) texts.  © 2022 ACM.","diversity;

The main contribution of this paper is the exploration of different late fusion methods to boost the performance of the combination based on the Transformer-based model and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for text and image, respectively. Additionally, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the effects of different image preprocessing methods for meme classification. We achieve 0.636 F1-macro average score for the binary sub-task A, and 0.632 F1-macro average score for the multi-label sub-task B. The present findings might help solve the inequality and discrimination women suffer on social media platforms. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Image processing;

The task deals with Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI). Hateful memes need to be detected within a data collection. For this task, we implemented six models for text and image analysis and tested the effectiveness of their combinations. A fusion system implements a multi-modal transformer to integrate the embeddings of these models. The best performing models included BERT for the text of the meme, manually derived associations for words in the memes and a Faster R-CNN network for the image. We evaluated the performance of our approach also with the data of the Facebook Hateful Memes challenge in order to analyze the generalisation capabilities of the approach. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","CNN network; Data collection; Deep text; Embeddings; Fusion systems; Image modeling; Image-analysis; Multi-modal; Text analysis; Text modeling; Semantics","","","","","","","Ba Lei Jimmy, Kiros Jamie Ryan, Hinton Geoffrey E., Layer normalization, CoRR, (2016); Basile Valerio, Bosco Cristina, Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Patti Viviana, Manuel Rangel Pardo Francisco, Rosso Paolo, Sanguinetti Manuela, SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter, Proc.13th Intl.

Drawing from theories of social cognition and gender stereotypes, we examine in this article how citizens react to male and female politicians who emphasize particular character traits. After synthesizing relevant literature, we report on a study conducted to see whether women lose public support for emphasizing their leadership ability—thus “going against type.” In a survey of more than 800 American adults, we found that respondents penalized a fictional woman running for Congress when her messaging to voters emphasized the core character trait of leadership, as opposed to compassion (a trait traditionally associated with women) or no character trait at all. In contrast, respondents viewed a fictional man more favorably when his messaging to voters went against type by highlighting compassion than when he emphasized leadership. These findings suggest that female candidates have fewer options than men do when selecting which personal characteristics to present in their messaging to gain the approval of the voting public. This result underscores the need for policies and programs that promote female leadership in all walks of life, thereby leading the public to associate leadership skill with both genders equally. © 2022, Brookings Institution Press.

The main novelty is an annotated dataset comprising relevant tweets in their context of occurrence. The corpus is made up of tweets and responses captured by different profiles replying to discriminatory content or objectionably couched news. An annotation scheme was created to illustrate the relevant dimensions of toxic speech and counterspeech. An analysis of the collected and annotated data and of the Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) that emerged during the annotation process is included. Moreover, we report about preliminary experiments on automatic counterspeech detection, based on supervised automatic learning models trained on the new dataset. The results highlight the fundamental role played by the context in this detection task, confirming our intuitions about the importance to collect tweets in their context of occurrence. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Annotated datasets; Annotation scheme; Automatic-learning; Detection tasks; Learning models; Computational linguistics","","","","","","","Artstein Ron, Poesio Massimo, Survey article: Inter-coder agreement for computational linguistics, Computational Linguistics, 34, 4, pp. 555-596, (2008); Basile Valerio, Fell Michael, Fornaciari Tommaso, Hovy Dirk, Paun Silviu, Plank Barbara, Poesio Massimo, Uma Alexandra, We need to consider disagreement in evaluation, Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Benchmarking: Past, Present and Future, pp. 15-21, (2021); Cepollaro Bianca, Remedies to discriminatory contents: On and offline counterspeech, Talk at HaLO Workshop, (2021); Chung Yi-Ling, Kuzmenko Elizaveta, Tekiroglu Serra Sinem, Guerini Marco, CONAN - COunter NArratives through nichesourcing: a multilingual dataset of responses to fight online hate speech, Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 2819-2829, (2019); Chung Yi-Ling, Tekiroglu Serra Sinem, Guerini Marco, Italian counter narrative generation to fight online hate speech, Proceedings of the Seventh Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics, CLiC-it 2020, 2769, (2020); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, (2016); Gagliardone Iginio, Countering Online Hate Speech - UNESCO, (2015); Jurgens David, Hemphill Libby, Chandrasekharan Eshwar, A just and comprehensive strategy for using NLP to address online abuse, Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 3658-3666, (2019); Langton R., Blocking as counter-speech, pp. 144-164, (2018); Lepoutre Maxime, Hate speech in public discourse: A pessimistic defense of counterspeech, Social Theory and Practice, 43, 4, pp. 851-883, (2017); Mathew Binny, Kumar Navish, Ravina Pawan Goyal, Mukherjee Animesh, Analyzing the hate and counter speech accounts on twitter, CoRR, (2018); Mathew Binny, Saha Punyajoy, Tharad Hardik, Rajgaria Subham, Singhania Prajwal, Maity Suman Kalyan, Goyal Pawan, Mukherjee Animesh, Thou shalt not hate: Countering online hate speech, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 13, pp. 369-380, (2019); Menini Stefano, Aprosio Alessio Palmero, Tonelli Sara, Abuse is contextual, what about nlp? the role of context in abusive language annotation and detection, CoRR, (2021); Orbach Matan, Bilu Yonatan, Toledo Assaf, Lahav Dan, Jacovi Michal, Aharonov Ranit, Slonim Noam, Out of the echo chamber: Detecting countering debate speeches, Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 7073-7086, (2020); Poletto Fabio, Basile Valerio, Sanguinetti Manuela, Bosco Cristina, Patti Viviana, Resources and benchmark corpora for hate speech detection: a systematic review, Language Resources and Evaluation, 55, 2, pp. 477-523, (2021); Polignano Marco, Basile Pierpaolo, de Gemmis Marco, Semeraro Giovanni, Basile Valerio, AlBERTo: Italian BERT Language Understanding Model for NLP Challenging Tasks Based on Tweets, Proceedings of the Sixth Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-it 2019), 2481, (2019); Sbisa Marina, Ideology and the persuasive use of presupposition.

Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography of seven hackathons, I provide insight into how references to memes and informal technology culture shape interaction in local manifestations of this culture. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, I show how vocabularies and artifacts of technology culture move between on and offline spaces. These findings have implications for HCI research that investigates questions of materiality in computer-mediated communication. Second, I show how even the mundane memes of technology culture can reveal the toxic masculinity and ideology of Incels. By tying these internet memes to a physical context, I unpack how humor can reveal and perpetuate the enduring masculine dominance of technology. I end with recommendations for increasing inclusivity at hackathons, based on how HCI is uniquely positioned to understand how Internet symbols and interactions manifest offline. © 2022 ACM.","Culture; Ethnography; Gender; Hackathons; Memes; Programming; Sexism","Computer programming; Computer-mediated communication; Culture; Ethnography; Hackathons; Meme; Offline; Programming; Sexism; Human engineering","","","","","","","Bechky B.A., Sharing meaning across occupational communities: The transformation of understanding on a production floor, Organization Science, 14, pp. 312-330, (2003); Bechky B.A., Gaffers, gofers, and grips: Role-based coordination in temporary organizations, Organization Science, 17, pp. 3-21, (2006); Bechky B.A., Object lessons: Workplace artifacts as representations of occupational jurisdiction, The Knowledge Economy and Lifelong Learning: A Critical Reader., 109, 3, pp. 229-256, (2012); Blomberg J., Suchman L., Trigg R., Reflections on Work-Oriented Design Project, Social Science, Technical Systems, and CooperativeWork: Beyond the Great Divide., 495, (2014); Brooke S., Breaking Gender Code: Visibility, Power, and Gender in Creative Coding Cultures, (2020); Brooke S., There are no girls on the Internet: Gender performances in Advice Animal memes, First Monday, 24, 10, (2019); Bucholtz M., Why be normal?: Language and identity practices in a community of nerd girls, Language in Society, 28, 2, pp. 203-223, (1999); Coleman G., The Hacker Conference: A ritual condensation and celebration of a lifeworld, Anthropological Quarterly, 83, 1, pp. 47-72, (2010); Colston H.L., Lee S.Y., Metaphor and symbol gender differences in verbal irony use, Metaphor and Symbol, 19, 4, pp. 289-306, (2004); Davis C.B., Glantz M., Novak D.R., You can't run your SUV on cute.

While students should not be considered responsible for fixing issues around discrimination in their institutions, they do have a role to play. In this paper, we present the results of a study in which 318 undergraduate computer science majors were presented with scenarios of discrimination and asked to identify the issues, rate the severity of the issues, and ideate 3-5 responses to address the described situations. They were also asked to identify which of their responses would likely be most effective in addressing discrimination and which of their responses they would be most likely to use if they were in the situation described in real life. Our results show that while students generally are able to identify various forms of discrimination (sexism, racism, religious discrimination, ethnic discrimination, etc.), any ambiguity in a scenario led to students describing the scenario as less severe and/or as an example of oversensitivity. We also show that students come up with many passive responses to scenarios of discrimination (such as ignoring the situation or wishing it had not happened in the first place). Students in our study were more likely to say they would deploy passive responses in real life, shying away from responses that involve direct confrontation. We observed some differences between student demographic subgroups. Women and BIPOC students in CS tend to think these issues are more severe than men and White and Asian students in CS. Women are more likely to ideate direct confrontation responses and report willingness to use direct confrontation responses in real situations. Our work contributes a methodology for examining student awareness and understanding of diversity issues as well as a demonstration that undergraduate computer science students need help in learning how to address common situations that involve either intentional or unintentional discrimination in an academic environment.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","Computing education; diversity; education climate; inclusion; microaggression; scenarios; vignettes","Education computing; Engineering education; Computing education; Diversity; Education climate; In-field; Learn+; Microaggression; Scenario; Student attitudes; Underrepresented students; Vignette; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1519160)","This research study was supported by the National Science Foundation Award #1519160, IUSE/PFE: Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED): The Connected Learner: Design Patterns for Transforming Computing and Informatics Education.

In two correlational studies, we examined possible antecedents of people’s willingness to participate in the #MeToo campaign by focusing on the role of ambivalent beliefs toward women and men and the perceived effects of the movement. Men (Study 1) and women (Study 2) were asked to answer questions concerning hostile and benevolent beliefs about women and men, respectively, their perception of the beneficial and detrimental effects of #MeToo, and their intentions to participate in the campaign. Study 1 showed that men’s hostile sexism toward women was associated with fewer intentions to actively support the #MeToo campaign and that the reduced beliefs that the movement had beneficial effects mediated this relation. Study 2 revealed that women’s stronger benevolent beliefs about men were associated with decreased perception that the #MeToo campaign had a beneficial impact. In turn, such a perception was related to lower intentions to participate in supporting the campaign. Moreover, women’s hostility toward men explained the intention to join the #MeToo movement through the mediation of the perception that the campaign was beneficial. The findings suggest that to foster participation in a feminist movement that promotes women’s rights, it is necessary to eradicate traditional gender roles and the related ideologies that legitimate men’s dominant position in society. © 2022 by the authors.","ambivalent sexism; collective action; feminism; gender equality; sexual harassment; sustainable development goals","exploration; movement","","","","","","","Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018: Global, Regional and National Prevalence Estimates for Intimate Partner Violence against Women and Global and Regional Prevalence Estimates for Non-Partner Sexual Violence against Women: Executive Summary, (2021); Fernando D., Prasad A., Sex-Based Harassment and Organizational Silencing: How Women Are Led to Reluctant Acquiescence in Academia, Hum.

In this paper, we empirically measure the prevalence of anti-social behavior in one of the world's most popular online community platforms. We operationalize this goal as measuring the proportion of unmoderated comments in the 97 most popular communities on Reddit that violate eight widely accepted platform norms. To achieve this goal, we contribute a human-AI pipeline for identifying these violations and a bootstrap sampling method to quantify measurement uncertainty. We find that 6.25% (95% Confidence Interval [5.36%, 7.13%]) of all comments in 2016, and 4.28% (95% CI [2.50%, 6.26%]) in 2020, are violations of these norms. Most anti-social behaviors remain unmoderated: moderators only removed one in twenty violating comments in 2016, and one in ten violating comments in 2020. Personal attacks were the most prevalent category of norm violation; pornography and bigotry were the most likely to be moderated, while politically inflammatory comments and misogyny/vulgarity were the least likely to be moderated. This paper offers a method and set of empirical results for tracking these phenomena as both the social practices (e.g., moderation) and technical practices (e.g., design) evolve.  © 2022 ACM.","Anti-social behavior; Moderation; Online communities","Online systems; Social behavior; Uncertainty analysis; Anti-social behavior; Bootstrap samplings; Confidence interval; Measurement uncertainty; Moderation; Most likely; Norm violation; On-line communities; Sampling method; Social behaviour; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Alkhatib A., Bernstein M., Street-level algorithms: A theory at the gaps between policy and decisions, Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-13, (2019); Anderson C.J., Poisson Regression for Regression of Counts and Rates, (2019); Angeli G., Tibshirani J., Wu J., Manning C.D., Combining Distant and Partial Supervision for Relation Extraction, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1556-1567, (2014); Barocas S., Crawford K., Shapiro A., Wallach H., The Problem With Bias: Allocative Versus Representational Harms in Machine Learning, SIGCIS Conference, (2017); Barrett P.M., Who Moderates the Social Media Giants?

What actions can they consider? In light of this debate, platforms have begun experimenting with softer alternatives to outright bans. We examine one such intervention called quarantining, that impedes direct access to and promotion of controversial communities. Specifically, we present two case studies of what happened when Reddit quarantined the influential communities r/TheRedPill (TRP) and r/The-Donald (TD). Using over 85M Reddit posts, we apply causal inference methods to examine the quarantine's effects on TRP and TD. We find that the quarantine made it more difficult to recruit new members: new user influx to TRP and TD decreased by 79.5% and 58%, respectively. Despite quarantining, existing users' misogyny and racism levels remained unaffected. We conclude by reflecting on the effectiveness of this design friction in limiting the influence of toxic communities and discuss broader implications for content moderation.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Prior studies link sexism, racism, Islamophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and intolerant forms of Christianity to supporting or voting for President Trump. We extend this literature by examining whether individuals who approve of President Trump’s job performance are more accepting of the hateful rhetoric and imagery they encounter online. We do so using online survey data (N = 465) of youth and young adults collected in December 2017. Building on previous theoretical explanations of participating in online hate that utilize routine activity theory and social learning–social structure theory, we argue that support for President Trump is a result of the “politics of status,” and support for the President thus represents an enthymeme. Our key finding is that agreement with online hate material is indeed positively associated with support for the President. Additionally, we find that one’s differential location in the social structure, online and off-line social bonds, and attitudes toward norm violations are associated with agreement with online extremist content. © The Author(s) 2020.","enthymemes; online extremism; President Trump","","","","","","U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ; National Institute of Justice, NIJ; Office of Justice Programs, OJP","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was supported by Award No. 2014-ZA-BX-0014, awarded by the National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.

According to a multitude of sources such as the European Council, hate speech can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a broader scale. That has led to increased awareness by governments, companies, and the scientific community, and although the field is relatively new, there have been considerable advancements in the field as a result of the collective effort. Despite the increasingly better results, most of the research focuses on the more popular languages (i.e., English, German, or Arabic), whereas less popular languages such as Bulgarian and other Balkan languages have been neglected. We have aggregated a real-world dataset from Bulgarian online forums and manually annotated 108,142 sentences. About 1.74% of which can be described with the categories racism, sexism, rudeness, and profanity. We then developed and evaluated various classifiers on the dataset and found that a support vector machine with a linear kernel trained on character-level TF-IDF features is the best model. Our work can be seen as another piece in the puzzle to building a strong foundation for future work on hate speech classification in Bulgarian. © 2022, Institute for Bulgarian Language.

Some characteristics such as sarcasm and multiple forms of sexism increase the difficulty of detecting and identifying this type of content. Nevertheless, it is essential to improve prediction quality to improve decision-making such as post removal, and user ban, among others. The main objective of this work is to propose a methodology and explore the use of different transformers architectures for two tasks in English and Spanish: sexism detection and sexism classification. Single-language and multilingual versions of the BERT, RoBERTa, and single-language versions of the Electra, and GPT2 architectures were evaluated on the EXIST 2022 shared task challenge at IberLEF 2022 dataset. It was observed that: (i) the use of the translation of the posts to English and then using single-language English and multilingual models present the best results; (ii) the best architectures were BERT and RoBERTa; (iii) using single-language Spanish models provided the worst results; (iv) sexism classification was more difficult than sexism detection; and (v) the use of ensembles were better than the GPT2 and Electra models, but worse than English single-language generally and multilingual models.

Most of these studies take intersectional fairness to be a matter of statistical parity among intersectional subgroups: an AI algorithm is ""intersectionally fair""if the probability of the outcome is roughly the same across all subgroups defined by different combinations of the protected attributes. This paper identifies and examines three fundamental problems with this dominant interpretation of intersectional fairness in AI. First, the dominant approach is so preoccupied with the intersection of attributes/categories (e.g., race, gender) that it fails to address the intersection of oppression (e.g., racism, sexism), which is more central to intersectionality as a critical framework. Second, the dominant approach faces a dilemma between infinite regress and fairness gerrymandering: it either keeps splitting groups into smaller subgroups or arbitrarily selects protected groups. Lastly, the dominant view fails to capture what it really means for AI algorithms to be fair, in terms of both distributive and non-distributive fairness. I distinguish a strong sense of AI fairness from a weak sense that is prevalent in the literature, and conclude by envisioning paths towards strong intersectional fairness in AI. © 2022 ACM.","Fairness and Bias in AI; Feminist and Critical Race Social Philosophy; Intersectionality; Philosophical Analysis of Fairness","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Fairness and bias in artificial intelligence; Feminist and critical race social philosophy; Intersectionality; Philosophical analyse of fairness; Splittings; Ethical technology","","","","","","","Angwin J., Larson J., Mattu S., Kirchner L., Machine Bias, ProPublica, (2016); Anthony Appiah K., The Case for Capitalizing the B in Black, The Atlantic, (2020); Bauder D., AP says it will capitalize Black but not white, (2020); Benjamin R., Race after technology: abolitionist tools for the New Jim Code, (2019); Binns R., On the apparent conflict between individual and group fairness, Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pp. 514-524, (2020); Buolamwini J., Gebru T., Gender shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency.

The goal is to detect the existence of misogynous memes in sub-task A. At the same time, the advanced multi-label sub-task B categorizes the misogyny of misogynous memes into one of four types: stereotype, shaming, objectification, and violence. The Ensemble technique has been used for three multi-modal deep learning models: two MMBT models and VisualBERT. Our proposed system ranked 17th place out of 83 participant teams with an F1-score of 0.722 in sub-task A, which shows a significant performance improvement over the baseline model's F1-score of 0.65. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Deep learning; Semantics; Baseline models; Ensemble techniques; F1 scores; Learning models; Multi-labels; Multi-modal; Performance; Subtask; Learning systems","","","","","","","Abdullah Malak, Shaikh Samira, Teamuncc at semeval-2018 task 1: Emotion detection in english and arabic tweets using deep learning, Proceedings of the 12th international workshop on semantic evaluation, pp. 350-357, (2018); Abedalla Ayat, Abdullah Malak, Al-Ayyoub Mahmoud, Benkhelifa Elhadj, 2st-unet: 2-stage training model using u-net for pneumothorax segmentation in chest x-rays, 2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 1-6, (2020); Abedalla Ayat, Abdullah Malak, Al-Ayyoub Mahmoud, Benkhelifa Elhadj, Chest x-ray pneumothorax segmentation using u-net with efficientnet and resnet architectures, PeerJ Computer Science, 7, (2021); Abedalla Ayat, Al-Sadi Aisha, Abdullah Malak, A closer look at fake news detection: A deep learning perspective, Proceedings of the 2019 3rd International Conference on Advances in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 24-28, (2019); Franí§ois Chollet, (2015); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Gasparini Francesca, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Faraj Dalya, Abdullah Malak, Sarcasmdet at semeval-2021 task 7: Detect humor and offensive based on demographic factors using roberta pre-trained model, Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021), pp. 527-533, (2021); He Kaiming, Zhang Xiangyu, Ren Shaoqing, Sun Jian, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); rn Isaksen Vebji, Gambi¤ck Bjorn, Using transfer-based language models to detect hateful and offensive language online, Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms, pp. 16-27, (2020); Kiela Douwe, Bhooshan Suvrat, Firooz Hamed, Perez Ethan, Testuggine Davide, Supervised multimodal bitransformers for classifying images and text, (2019); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Fitzpatrick Casey A, Bull Peter, Lipstein Greg, Nelli Tony, Zhu Ron, Et al., The hateful memes challenge: competition report, NeurIPS 2020 Competition and Demonstration Track, pp. 344-360, (2021); Levy Leonard Williams, Levy Leonard W, Karst Kenneth L, Winkler Adam, Encyclopedia of the american constitution, (2000); Li Liunian Harold, Yatskar Mark, Yin Da, Hsieh Cho-Jui, Chang Kai-Wei, Visualbert: A simple and performant baseline for vision and language, (2019); Liu Yinhan, Ott Myle, Goyal Naman, Du Jingfei, Joshi Mandar, Chen Danqi, Levy Omer, Lewis Mike, Zettlemoyer Luke, Stoyanov Veselin, Roberta: A robustly optimized bert pretraining approach, (2019); Paszke Adam, Gross Sam, Massa Francisco, Lerer Adam, Bradbury James, Chanan Gregory, Killeen Trevor, Lin Zeming, Gimelshein Natalia, Antiga Luca, Et al., Pytorch: An imperative style, high-performance deep learning library, Advances in neural information processing systems, 32, (2019); Sandulescu Vlad, Detecting hateful memes using a multimodal deep ensemble, (2020); Shang Lanyu, Zhang Yang, Zha Yuheng, Chen Yingxi, Youn Christina, Wang Dong, Aomd: An analogy-aware approach to offensive meme detection on social media, Information Processing & Management, 58, 5, (2021); Simonyan Karen, Zisserman Andrew, Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, (2014); Watanabe Hajime, Bouazizi Mondher, Ohtsuki Tomoaki, Hate speech on twitter: A pragmatic approach to collect hateful and offensive expressions and perform hate speech detection, IEEE access, 6, pp. 13825-13835, (2018); Wolf Thomas, Debut Lysandre, Sanh Victor, Chaumond Julien, Delangue Clement, Moi Anthony, Cistac Pierric, Rault Tim, Louf Remi, Funtowicz Morgan, Et al., Huggingface's transformers: State-of-the-art natural language processing, (2019); Wu Yuxin, Kirillov Alexander, Massa Francisco, Lo Wan-Yen, Girshick Ross, Detectron2, (2019)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

Despite that, less than five percent of the online communities have 'safe spaces' focused on supporting women. In this article, we present the results of our in-depth study of these women-focused spaces. These spaces exist to provide a common forum for discussion, support, empowerment, and engagement of minorities in OSS. Our analysis focuses on the messages related to sexism and discrimination experiences as posted on these discussion forums by women of OSS. The results demonstrate examples of harassment, the support that these spaces provide, and the impact of the discrimination on the presence of women in OSS in general. We conclude with recommendations for OSS community organizers for creating a friendly, equitable environment for women in OSS. ACM Reference format: Vandana Singh and William Brandon. 2022.

However, content moderators witness the worst of humanity on a daily basis in place of the average netizen. This takes its toll on moderators, causing stress, fatigue, and emotional distress akin to the symptomology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of the present study was to explore whether adding positive stimuli to breaktimes-images of baby animals or beautiful, aweinspiring landscapes-could help reduce the negative side-effects of being a content moderator. To test this, we had over 300 experienced content moderators read and decide whether 200 fake text-based social media posts were acceptable or not for public consumption. Although we set out to test positive emotional stimulation, however, we actually found that it is the cumulative nature of the negative emotions that likely negates most of the effects of the intervention: the longer the person had practiced content moderation, the stronger their negative experience. Connections to compassion fatigue and how best to spend work breaks as a content moderator are discussed.  © 2022 ACM.","compassion fatigue; content moderation; emotional distress; social networking sites; stress","Fake detection; Moderators; Compassion fatigue; Content moderation; Cyberspaces; Emotional distress; Emotional stimulations; Online content; Rules and regulations; Social networking site; Social-networking; Stress reduction; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","MINDFULNESS 10 Minutes Breath Meditation-YouTube, (2015); Almanza-Sepulveda M.L., Dudin A., Wonch K.E., Steiner M., Feinberg D.R., Fleming A.S., Hall G.B, 2018 Exploring the morphological and emotional correlates of infant cuteness, Infant Behavior and Development, 53, (2018); Anderson C.L., Monroy M., Keltner D., 2018 Awe in nature heals: Evidence from military veterans, at-risk youth, and college students, Emotion, 18, (2018); Bacon M.M., Rood E.A., Washburn M.F., 1914.

The ArMI task combines two related classification subtasks: a main binary classification subtask for detecting the presence of misogynistic language, and a fine-grained multi-class classification subtask for identifying seven misogynistic behaviors found in misogynistic contents of 9,833 Arabic/dialectal tweets1. The systems introduced by the participants employed various methods including feature-based, neural networks using either classical machine learning techniques, ensemble methods or transformers. The best performing system achieved an F-measure of 91.4% and 66.5% for subtask A and subtask B, respectively.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","Arabic language; Misogyny identification; Social media","Classification (of information); Fires; Social networking (online); Arabic languages; Binary classification; Content detection; Feature-based; Fine grained; Machine learning techniques; Misogyny identification; Neural-networks; Social media; Subtask; Learning systems","","","","","","","Antoun W., Baly F., Hajj H., Arabert: Transformer-based model for Arabic language understanding, LREC 2020 Workshop Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 9-15, (2020); Fersini E., Nozza D., Rosso P., Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (ami), EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 12, (2018); Fersini E., Rosso P., Anzovino M., Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018, Third Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages (IberEval 2018), 2150, pp. 214-228, (2018); Frenda S., Ghanem B., Montes-Y Gomez M., Exploration of misogyny in Spanish and english tweets, 3rd Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages (IberEval 2018), 2150, pp. 260-267, (2018); Eastin Moloney M., Love T.P., Assessing online misogyny: Perspectives from sociology and feminist media studies, Sociology Compass, 12, 5, (2018); Mulki H., Ghanem B., Let-mi: An Arabic levantine twitter dataset for misogynistic language, Proceedings of the Sixth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop, pp. 154-163, (2021); John T.N., Hate speech, Encyclopedia of the American Constitution, 1, (2000); Poland B., Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online, (2016)","","Ganguly D.; Gangopadhyay S.; Mitra M.; Majumder P.; Majumder P.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGIR","13th Annual Meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, FIRE 2021","13 December 2021 through 17 December 2021","Virtual, Online","176677","","978-145039596-0","","","English","ACM Int.

Misogyny automatic detection systems can assist in the prohibition of anti-women Arabic toxic content. Developing such systems is hindered by the lack of the Arabic misogyny benchmark datasets. In this paper, we introduce an Arabic Levantine Twitter dataset for Misogynistic language (LeT-Mi) to be the first benchmark dataset for Arabic misogyny. We further provide a detailed review of the dataset creation and annotation phases. The consistency of the annotations for the proposed dataset was emphasized through inter-rater agreement evaluation measures. Moreover, Let-Mi was used as an evaluation dataset through binary/multi-/target classification tasks conducted by several state-of-the-art machine learning systems along with Multi-Task Learning (MTL) configuration. The obtained results indicated that the performances achieved by the used systems are consistent with state-of-the-art results for languages other than Arabic, while employing MTL improved the performance of the misogyny/target classification tasks. © WANLP 2021 - 6th Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop","","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Linearization; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Automatic detection systems; Benchmark datasets; Classification tasks; Evaluation measures; Inter-rater agreements; Multi-targets; Multitask learning; Performance; State of the art; Target Classification; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Al-Ajlan Monirah A., Ykhlef Mourad, Op_timized twitter cyberbullying detection based on deep learning, Proceedings of the 21st Saudi Computer Society National Computer Conference (NCC), pp. 52-56, (2018); Al-Hassan Areej, Al-Dossari Hmood, Detection of hate speech in social networks: A survey on multilingual corpus, Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT), 9, 2, pp. 83-100, (2019); Alakrota Azalden, Murray Liam, Nikolov Nikola S., Dataset construction for the detection of anti_social behaviour in online communication in arabic, (2018); Procedia Computer Science, 142, pp. 174-181; Albadi Nuha, Kurdi Maram, Mishra Shivakant, Are they our brothers? analysis and detection of religious hate speech in the arabic twittersphere, (2018); Proceedings of IEEE/ACM International Confer_ence on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), pp. 69-76; Antoun Wissam, Baly Fady, Hajj Hazem, (2020); AraBERT: Transformer-based Model for Arabic Language Understanding, Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Open-Source Arabic Corpora and Pro_cessing Tools, with a Shared Task on Offensive Lan_guage Detection, pp. 9-15; Anzovino Maria, Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64, (2018); Aurora Data, Lebanon protest statistics, (2019); Caruana Rich, Multitask learning, Machine learning, 28, 1, pp. 41-75, (1997); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Un_derstanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Edwards Aleksandra, Camacho-Collados Jose, el`ene De Ribaupierre H, Preece Alun, Go Sim_ple and Pre-Train on Domain-Specific Corpora: On the Role of Training Data for Text Classification, Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pp. 5522-5529, (2020); Ferrier Michelle, Garud-Patkar Nisha, Troll_busters: Fighting online harassment of women jour_nalists, Mediating Misogyny, pp. 311-332, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Rosso Paolo, Overview of the EVALITA 2018 Task on Automatic Misogyny Identification (AMI), EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 12, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Anzovino Maria, Overview of the Task on Automatic Misog_yny Identification at IberEval 2018, Third Work_shop on Evaluation of Human Language Technolo_gies for Iberian Languages (IberEval 2018), 2150, pp. 214-228, (2018); Frenda Simona, Ghanem Bilal, Montes-y Gomez Manuel, Exploration of Misogyny in Spanish and English Tweets, 3rd Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Lan_guages (IberEval 2018), 2150, pp. 260-267, (2018); Kochkina Elena, Liakata Maria, Zubi_aga Arkaitz, All-in-one: Multi-task learning for ru_mour verification, Proceedings of the 27th Inter_national Conference on Computational Linguistics, pp. 3402-3413, (2018); Krippendorff Klaus, Computing krippendorff(tm)s alpha-reliability.

However, effective ways still have to be found to stimulate an intense reflexion and raise empathy, especially among aggressors and bystanders. Using a virtual reality gallery, including diverse multimedia material and feedback options to stimulate a discussion among visitors, we create an immersive, educating and interactive experience. Rather than moralizing, the gallery promotes a self-paced exploration of the material, combines personal stories with instructive facts to sensitize to street harassment.  © 2021 IEEE.","Awareness; Catcalling; Gender equality; Sensitization; Sexism; Street harassment; Virtual reality","Feedback options; Immersive; Multimedia materials; Social media; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Fairchild K., Rudman L.A., Everyday stranger harassment and women's objectification, Social Justice Research, 21, 3, pp. 338-357, (2008); Fileborn B., Vera-Gray F., I want to be able to walk the street without fear: Transforming justice for street harassment, Feminist Legal Studies, 25, 2, pp. 203-227, (2017); Stop Street Harassment, (2008); Devine P.G., Stereotypes and prejudice: Their automatic and controlled components, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, 1, pp. 5-18, (1989); Crandall C.S., Eshleman A., A justification-suppression model of the expression and experience of prejudice, Psychological Bulletin, 129, 3, pp. 414-446, (2003); Ainsworth S., Deft: A conceptual framework for considering learning with multiple representations, Learning and Instruction, 16, 3, pp. 183-198, (2006); Ahn S.J., Bailenson J.N., Park D., Short-and long-term effects of embodied experiences in immersive virtual environments on environmental locus of control and behavior, Computers in Human Behavior, 39, pp. 235-245, (2014); Ingram K.M., Espelage D.L., Merrin G.J., Valido A., Heinhorst J., Joyce M., Evaluation of a virtual reality enhanced bullying prevention curriculum pilot trial, Journal of Adolescence, 71, pp. 72-83, (2019); Muller D.A., Van Kessel C.R., Janssen S., Through pink and blue glasses, Extended Abstracts Publication of the Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play, pp. 599-605, (2017); Dumpel V., Eimler S., Brandenberg G., Strassmann C., Arntz A., Kessler D., Zielinski S., Comparing the effects of virtual reality vs. Tablet-based diversity interventions, 11th Conference of the Media Psychlogy Division, (2019); Cat Calls of Mainz-sexuelle Belästigung Ankreiden, (2020); Catcalling: Rollentausch, (2020); Stop Street Harassment-statistics, (2008)","","Chang M.; Chen N.-S.; Sampson D.G.; Tlili A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","21st IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2021","12 July 2021 through 15 July 2021","Virtual, Online","171220","","978-166544106-3","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

According to information collected by the Ministry of the Interior of Spain, the category of sexual orientation and gender identity is subject to the third-highest number of registered hate crimes, ranking behind racism/xenophobia and ideology. However, most of the existing computational approaches to online hate detection simultaneously attempt to address all types of discrimination, leading to weaker prototype performances. These approaches focus on other reasons for hate—primarily racism and xenophobia—and usually focus on English messages. Furthermore, few detection models have used manually generated databases as a training corpus. Using supervised machine learning techniques, the present research sought to overcome these limitations by developing and evaluating an automatic detector of hate speech motivated by gender and sexual orientation. The focus was Spanish-language posts on Twitter. For this purpose, eight predictive models were developed from an ad hoc generated training corpus, using shallow modeling and deep learning. The evaluation metrics showed that the deep learning algorithm performed significantly better than the shallow modeling algorithms, and logistic regression yielded the best performance of the shallow algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

To carry out this study, we develop classifiers for offensive and aggressive language identification in Hindi, Bangla, and English using the datasets released for the languages as part of the two shared tasks: hate speech and offensive content identification in Indo-European languages (HASOC) and aggression and misogyny identification task at TRAC-2. The HASOC dataset is annotated with the information about offensive language and TRAC-2 dataset is annotated with the information about aggressive language. We experiment with SVM as well as BERT and its different derivatives such as ALBERT and DistilBERT for developing the classifiers. The best classifiers achieve an impressive F-score in between 0.70 and 0.80 for different tasks. We use these classifiers to cross-annotate the two datasets, and look at the co-occurrence of different sub-categories of aggression and offense. The study shows that even though aggression and offense significantly overlaps, but still one does not entail the other. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Aggression; Bangla; BERT; Comparison; English; HASOC; Hindi; Offensive language; TRAC","","","","","","","","Agarwal S., Sureka A., Using knn and svm based one-class classifier for detecting online radicalization on twitter, International Conference on Distributed Computing and Internet Technology, pp. 431-442, (2015); Sureka A.

Arabic Misogyny Identification task (ArMI) is introduced within the Hate Speech and Offensive Content detection (HASOC) track at FIRE-2021. The ArMI task combines two related classification subtasks: a main binary classification subtask for detecting the presence of misogynistic language, and a fine-grained multi-class classification subtask for identifying seven misogynistic behaviors found in misogynistic contents. The data provided for this task is a Twitter dataset composed of 9,833 tweets written in modern standard Arabic (MSA) and several Arabic dialects including Levantine, Egyptian and Gulf1. ArMI at FIRE-2021 has got a total of 15 submitted runs for Sub-task A and 13 runs for Sub-task B provided by six different teams. The systems introduced by the participants employed various methods including feature-based, neural networks using either classical machine learning techniques, ensemble methods or transformers. The best performing system achieved an F-measure of 91.4% and 66.5% for subtask A and subtask B, respectively. This indicates that misogynistic language detection and misogynistic behaviors identification in Arabic textual contents can be, effectively, addressed using transformer-based approaches. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Arabic language; Misogyny identification; Social media","Fires; Social networking (online); Arabic languages; Binary classification; Content detection; Fine grained; Misogyny identification; Modern standards; Multi-class classification; Social media; Standard arabics; Subtask; Learning systems","","","","","","","Nockleby J.

It proposes a theoretical model, of a bottom-up nature, to achieve gender equality in the school environment, giving special importance to teacher training. This study evaluates the training in gender equality and coeducation that students with degrees related to teaching are receiving. An analysis is conducted of the presence of attitudes that support the gender/sex system and the identification of relevant female references in a sample of 452 students in the Degree in Primary Education or the University Master’s Degree in Teacher Training for Compulsory Secondary Education, Upper Secondary Education, Vocational Training, and Language Teaching (MUPES). For the collection of information, an ad hoc questionnaire was used that contemplates formative and cultural aspects, together with the Inventory of Ambivalent Sexism (ASI), the Attitudes of Heterosexuals toward Homosexuals (HATH), and the Women in History (WH) scales. Among the main results, the important lack of training in aspects related to gender equality and coeducation, as well as a general lack of knowledge of historical female references, stands out. It can be concluded that, at present, teacher training is still in the early stages of the proposed model. © 2021 by the authors.

Hateful contents may be expressed through popular communication tools, like memes. A meme is an image characterised by a pictorial content with an overlaying text introduced a posteriori, and its main aim is originally to be funny and/or ironic. However, the use of memes to convey misogynous messages has increased and thus an automatic detection of these contents seems to be necessary to counteract this phenomenon. This task is particularly challenging, having that (1) different memes can present the same image, but different texts and vice versa, (2) two memes with the same image but different texts can convey a misogynous and not misogynous message, respectively, (3) misogyny can be expressed by image alone, text alone or their combination. In this paper both unimodal and multimodal approaches are investigated whose classifiers are trained and tested on a dataset of in the wild memes, which present both experts and perceived labels. The proposed multimodal approach provides better results compared to the unimodal ones and the VisualBERT state-of-the-art benchmark. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Image processing; Memes; Misogyny detection; Multimodal classifier; Natural language processing","Classification (of information); Natural language processing systems; Images processing; Language processing; Meme; Misogyny detection; Multi-modal approach; Multimodal classifiers; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Social media platforms; Unimodal; Image classification","","","","","","","Afridi T.H., Alam A., Khan M.N., Khan J., Lee Y.K., A multimodal memes classification: A survey and open research issues, The Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Smart City Applications, pp. 1451-1466, (2020); Bianco S., Gasparini F., Schettini R., Adaptive skin classification using face and body detection, IEEE Trans.

The first shared task on sEXism Identifi- cation in Social neTworks (EXIST) at IberLEF 2021 is an international competition in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the aim to automatically identify sexism in social media content by applying machine learning methods. Thereby sexism detection is formulated as a coarse (binary) classification problem and a fine-grained classification task that distinguishes multiple types of sexist content (e.g., dominance, stereotyping, and objectification). This paper presents the contribution of the AIT FHSTP team at the EXIST2021 benchmark for both tasks. To solve the task,s we applied two multilingual transformer models, one based on multilingual BERT and one based on XLM-R. Our approach uses two different strategies to adapt the transformers to the detection of sexist content: First, unsupervised pre-training with additional data and second, supervised fine-tuning with additional and augmented data. For both tasks our best model is XLM-R with unsupervised pre-training on the EXIST data and additional datasets and fine-tuning on the provided dataset. The best run for the binary classification (task 1) achieves a macro F1-score of 0.7752 and scores 5th rank in the benchmark; for the multiclass classification (task 2) our best submission scores 6th rank with a macro F1-score of 0.5589. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

It seeks to provide useful information on the existence of sexist and discriminatory roles in films that are commonly used as pedagogical materials and to discover if this material rather than helping professionals in educating children for gender equality, becomes a means by which children may learn counter values. The study has been carried out using a qualitative approach and content analysis has been followed in order to access the percentage of female characters in the films, its relationship with other characters and the plot patterns that are given to each main character depending on their gender. Results reveal that there is an unequal representation of female and male characters, and gender stereotypes and sexist behaviors that perpetuate the roles and traditional social image endorsed to women and men are identified. As conclusion, it can be argued that these films cannot be considered as educational resources that promote that gender equality values that characterize any coeducational experience at the school unless both teachers and children undertake a critical analysis with a gender perspective during the film screening in the classroom. © 2021 Universidad de Sevilla.

In the wake of growing documentation of experiences of sexism on the web, the automatic categorization of accounts of sexism has the potential to assist social scientists and policymakers in studying and thereby countering sexism. The existing work on sexism classification has certain limitations in terms of the categories of sexism used and/or whether they can co-occur. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the multi-label classification of sexism of any kind(s).1 We also consider the related task of misogyny classification. While sexism classification is performed on textual accounts describing sexism suffered or observed, misogyny classification is carried out on tweets perpetrating misogyny. We devise a novel neural framework for classifying sexism and misogyny that can combine text representations obtained using models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with distributional and linguistic word embeddings using a flexible architecture involving recurrent components and optional convolutional ones. Further, we leverage unlabeled accounts of sexism to infuse domain-specific elements into our framework. To evaluate the versatility of our neural approach for tasks pertaining to sexism and misogyny, we experiment with adapting it for misogyny identification. For categorizing sexism, we investigate multiple loss functions and problem transformation techniques to address the multi-label problem formulation. We develop an ensemble approach using a proposed multi-label classification model with potentially overlapping subsets of the category set. Proposed methods outperform several deep-learning as well as traditional machine learning baselines for all three tasks.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","machine learning; misogyny classification; misogyny detection; multi-label classification; neural networks; Sexism classification; text classification","Recurrent neural networks; Automatic categorization; Ensemble approaches; Flexible architectures; Multi label classification; Multi-label problems; Problem transformations; Recurrent components; Text representation; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Agrawal S., Awekar A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms, Proceedings of the European Conference on Information Retrieval.

In the case of sarcasm, a more aggressive type of irony, the intent is to mock or scorn a victim without excluding the possibility to hurt. Stereotypes are often used, especially in discussions about controversial issues such as immigration, sexism, and misogyny. Regarding PAN’s open submission toward tackling this issue, we use BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) as a way to identify ironic and sarcastic phrases from genuine ones in Twitter posts. Since the goal is to detect irony in texts published on social media, and usually social media users have a different writing style and their texts contain a variety of nonstandard language expressions, the input texts are deep cleaned before feeding into the BERT network. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the accuracy and training loss ratio of the BERT network by applying deep cleaning to input texts. Thus, we achieved up to 98.5 percent accuracy with the proposed method. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Author Profiling; BERT; Irony Detection; Stereotypes; Text Cleaning","Social networking (online); Author profiling; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Irony detection; Loss ratio; Social media; Stereotype; Text cleaning; Twitter posts; Writing style; Cleaning","","","","","","","Curco Carmen, Irony: Negation, Echo, and Metarepresentation, Irony in Language and Thought, pp. 269-296, (2007); Grice H.

Tecnológica Federal Do Paraná, Brazil","Context: Addressing women's under-representation in the soft-ware industry, a widely recognized concern, requires attracting as well as retaining more women. Hearing from women practitioners, particularly those positioned in multi-cultural settings, about their challenges and and adopting their lived experienced solutions can support the design of programs to resolve the under-representation issue. Goal: We investigated the challenges women face in global software development teams, particularly what motivates women to leave their company; how those challenges might break down according to demographics; and strategies to mitigate the identified challenges. Method: To achieve this goal, we conducted an ex-ploratory case study in Ericsson, a global technology company. We surveyed 94 women and employed mixed-methods to analyze the data. Results: Our findings reveal that women face socio-cultural challenges, including work-life balance issues, benevolent and hos-tile sexism, lack of recognition and peer parity, impostor syndrome, glass ceiling bias effects, the prove-it-again phenomenon, and the maternal wall. The participants of our research provided different suggestions to address/mitigate the reported challenges, including sabbatical policies, flexibility of location and time, parenthood support, soft skills training for managers, equality of payment and opportunities between genders, mentoring and role models to sup-port career growth, directives to hire more women, inclusive groups and events, women's empowerment, and recognition for women's success. The framework of challenges and suggestions can inspire further initiatives both in academia and industry to onboard and retain women. Women represent less than 24% of employees in software development industry and experience various types of prejudice and bias. Even in companies that care about Diversity & Inclusion, 'untying the mooring ropes' of socio-cultural problems is hard. Hearing from women, especially those working in a multi-cultural organization, about their challenges and adopting their suggestions can be vital to design programs and resolve the under-representation issue. In this work we work closely with a large software development or-ganization which invests and believes in diversity and inclusion. We listened to women and the challenges they face in global soft-ware development teams of this company and what these women suggest reduce the problems and increase retention. Our research showed that women face work-life balance issues and encounter invisible barriers that prevent them from rising to top positions. They also suffer micro-aggression and sexism, need to show com-petence constantly, be supervised in essential tasks, and receive less work after becoming mothers. Moreover, women miss having more female colleagues, lack self-confidence and recognition. The women from the company suggested sabbatical policies, the flexibil-ity of location and time, parenthood support, soft skills training for managers, equality of opportunities, role models to support career growth, directives to hire more women, support groups, and more interaction between women, inclusive groups and events, women's empowerment by publishing their success stories in media and recognizing their achievements. Our results had been shared with the company Human Resources department and management and they considered the diagnosis helpful and will work on actions to mitigate the challenges that women still perceive. © 2022 IEEE.","diversity; gender; inclusion; software engineering; women","Employment; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Software design; Case-studies; Diversity; Gender; Role model; Skill training; Socio-cultural; Soft skills; Woman; Women empowerment; Work-life balance; Audition","","","","","","","World Economic Forum, (2021); Albusays K., Bjorn P., Dabbish L., Ford D., Murphy-Hill E., Serebrenik A., Storey M., The diversity crisis in software development, IEEE Software, 38, 2, pp. 19-25, (2021); Willard Allport G., Clark K., Pettigrew T., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Jacob A.A., Motivation and Personality: By AH Maslow, (1955); Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 24, pp. 447-448, (1955); Balali S., Steinmacher I., Annamalai U., Sarma A., Aurelio Gerosa M., Newcomers' barriers. is that all? an analysis of mentors' and newcomers' barriers in OSS projects, Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), 27, 3-6, pp. 679-714, (2018); Barker L.J., McDowell C., Kalahar K., Exploring factors that influence computer science introductory course students to persist in the major, ACM Sigcse Bulletin, 41, 1, pp. 153-157, (2009); Biernat M., Kobrynowicz D., Gender-and race-based standards of competence: lower minimum standards but higher ability standards for devalued groups, Journal of personality and social psychology, 72, 3, (1997); Bjorn P., Menendez-Blanco M., FemTech: Broadening participation to digital technology development, Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 510-511, (2019); Bjorn P., Rosner D.K., Intertextual design: The hidden stories of Atari women, Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 1-26, (2021); Branden M., Gender, gender ideology, and couples' migration decisions, Journal of Family Issues, 35, 7, pp. 950-971, (2014); Butler J., Gender is burning: Questions of, Feminist film theory: A reader, (1999); Calvo D., The (in) visible barriers to free software: Inequalities in online communities in Spain, Studies in Communication Sciences, 21, 1, pp. 163-178, (2021); Dias Canedo E., Bonifacio R., Vinicius Okimoto M., Serebrenik A., Pinto G., Monteiro E., Work Practices and Perceptions from Women Core Developers in OSS Communities, Proceedings of the 14th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM), pp. 1-11, (2020); Dias Canedo E., Freitas Mendes F., Jefferson Cerqueira A., Bonifacio R., Vinicius Okimoto M., Pinto G., Breaking one barrier at a time: how women developers cope in a men-dominated industry, Software Engineering (SBES), 2021 Brazilian Symposium on.

The phenomenon, also known as Catcalling, recently gained renewed attention in public discussions initiated by social media activists. Combining VR with interactive instruction settings known from museums might be a promising way to effectively reach victims, bystanders, and aggressors alike and obtain a lasting attitude and behavior change. We present a virtual gallery where visitors can explore a variety of curated interactive multimedia material intended to inform, raise awareness, inspire empathy, perspective-taking, and behavioral change. With interactions such as a self-assessment test, as well as opportunities for visitors to leave feedback and thoughts in the gallery, this virtual world can be used as a sensitization tool. Based on a first evaluation with experts (N = 16), the original proof-of-concept prototype was extended and evaluated by a larger group including students (N = 50). © 2021 IEEE","Awareness; Self-assessment; Sensitization; Sexism; Street harassment; Virtual reality","E-learning; Interactive computer systems; Multimedia systems; Attitude change; Awareness; Behaviour changes; Interactive instructions; Interactive multimedia; Self-assessment; Sensitisation; Sexism; Social media; Street harassment; Virtual reality","","","","","Institute of Positive Computing; Marie Fuchs; Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","The authors would like to thank Marie Fuchs, Paula Gerlitz and Mirian Thelen for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript, as well all participants and colleagues providing feedback about the application and contributing to its evaluation.

Experimental results show that our final model with the voting function has achieved the best results among our four models, which means that this voting mechanism brings an extra benefit to our system.

However, it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.  © 2021 ACM.","antisemitism; deep learning; hate speech; multimodal classification","E-learning; Learning systems; Signal processing; Social networking (online);

While research in the sexism detection domain is growing, most of this research focuses on English as the language and on Twitter as the platform. Our objective here is to broaden the scope of this research by considering the Chinese language on Sina Weibo. We propose the first Chinese sexism dataset – Sina Weibo Sexism Review (SWSR) dataset –, as well as a large Chinese lexicon SexHateLex made of abusive and gender-related terms. We introduce our data collection and annotation process, and provide an exploratory analysis of the dataset characteristics to validate its quality and to show how sexism is manifested in Chinese. The SWSR dataset provides labels at different levels of granularity including (i) sexism or non-sexism, (ii) sexism category and (iii) target type, which can be exploited, among others, for building computational methods to identify and investigate finer-grained gender-related abusive language. We conduct experiments for the three sexism classification tasks making use of state-of-the-art machine learning models. Our results show competitive performance, providing a benchmark for sexism detection in the Chinese language, as well as an error analysis highlighting open challenges needing more research in Chinese NLP. The SWSR dataset and SexHateLex lexicon are publicly available.1 © 2021","Abusive language detection; Chinese sexism dataset; Chinese sexist lexicon; Hate speech detection; Natural language processing; Sexism detection","Benchmarking; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Quality control; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Abusive language detection; Chinese language; Chinese sexism dataset; Chinese sexist lexicon; Hate speech detection; Language detection; Sexism detection; Sina-weibo; Social media platforms; Speech detection; Natural language processing systems","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201908510140)","Aiqi Jiang is funded by China Scholarship Council (CSC Funding, No. 201908510140).

A portion of these online communities facilitate radicalist viewpoints, including toward marginalized populations, contributing to misbehavior and exacerbating social inequalities. Although a variety of theories propose to explain the processes of online radicalization, less work has empirically examined how users' communication patterns change over time, especially in terms of novelty versus regularity of user comment features. The present research demonstrates a new modeling approach for examining the extent to which low-level, multimodal comment patterns evolve as users communicate within a Reddit forum well-known for its extreme misogynism. Our results confirm that low-level comment patterns predict high-level features of radicalization, aligning with theory on attitude polarization and contributing to literature on detection and interventions to mitigate extremism.  © 2021 ACM.","emergent patterns; multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis; multimodal; nonlinear dynamical systems theory; radicalization; sexism; social media","Hypertext systems; Information dissemination; Communication pattern; High-level features; Model approach; Multi-modal; On-line communities; Social inequalities; Social interactions; Social media; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Agarwal S., Sureka A., A focused crawler for mining hate and extremism promoting videos on YouTube, Proceedings of the 25th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media (HT ?14), Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, pp. 294-296, (2014); Agarwal S., Sureka A., Using knn and svm based one-class classifier for detecting online radicalization on twitter, Distributed Computing and Internet Technology (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 431-442, (2015); Agarwal S., Sureka A., Applying Social Media Intelligence for Predicting and Identifying On-line Radicalization and Civil Unrest Oriented Threats.

In this article, we seek to systematically explore the experiences from politically engaged women Twitter users in New Zealand in order to draw some lessons, through a thematic and interpretative analytical approach, at four different strategic levels on how to deflect intimidating and aggressive behaviour. We conclude that understanding strategically how structural social locations like gender effect the ability to contribute to political participation and engagement, if addressed, can produce more inclusive and productive online political and policy spaces. Further, this strategic approach involves connecting together different levels of response to online negativity such as platform tools, space-curation, and monitoring, having these made coherent with each other, as well as with this strategic understanding of how structural social location plays into access and use of online political and policy spaces.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

Applications powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly being used in the real world to provide critical decisions about who is going to be hired, granted a loan, admitted to college, etc. However, the main pillars of AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) have been shown to reflect and even amplify gender biases and stereotypes, which are mainly inherited from historical training data. In an effort to facilitate the identification and mitigation of gender bias in English text, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that relies on the following gender bias types: Generic Pronouns, Sexism, Occupational Bias, Exclusionary Bias, and Semantics. We also provide a bottom-up overview of gender bias, from its societal origin to its spillover onto language. Finally, we link the societal implications of gender bias to their corresponding type(s) in the proposed taxonomy. The underlying motivation of our work is to help enable the technical community to identify and mitigate relevant biases from training corpora for improved fairness in NLP systems.  ©2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Bottom up; Gender bias; Gender stereotypes; Human potential; Machine-learning; Real-world; Societal implications; Technical community; Training corpus; Training data; Taxonomies","","","","","","","Arthur Andrea E, Bigler Rebecca S, Liben Lynn S, Gelman Susan A, Ruble Diane N, Gender stereotyping and prejudice in young children: A developmental intergroup perspective, (2008); Barreto Manuela, Ellemers Naomi, The burden of benevolent sexism: How it contributes to the maintenance of gender inequalities, European journal of social psychology, 35, 5, pp. 633-642, (2005); Becker Julia C, Wright Stephen C, Yet another dark side of chivalry: Benevolent sexism undermines and hostile sexism motivates collective action for social change, Journal of personality and social psychology, 101, 1, (2011); Bigler Rebecca S, Leaper Campbell, Gendered language: Psychological principles, evolving practices, and inclusive policies, Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 2, 1, pp. 187-194, (2015); Bigler Rebecca S, Liben Lynn S, A developmental intergroup theory of social stereotypes and prejudice, Advances in child development and behavior, 34, pp. 39-89, (2006); Blaubergs Maija S, An analysis of classic arguments against changing sexist language, Women's studies international quarterly, 3, 2-3, pp. 135-147, (1980); Blodgett Su Lin, Barocas Solon, Daume Hal, Wallach Hanna, Language (Technology) is Power: A Critical Survey of ""Bias"" in NLP, (2020); Blodgett Su Lin, Barocas Solon, Daume Hal, Wallach Hanna, Language (technology) is power: A critical survey of ""bias"" in NLP, Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 5454-5476, (2020); Bodine Ann, Androcentrism in prescriptive grammar: singular 'they', sex-indefinite 'he', and 'he or she, Language in Society, 4, pp. 129-146, (1975); Bojanowski Piotr, Grave Edouard, Joulin Armand, Mikolov Tomas, EnrichingWord Vectors with Subword Information, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Boroditsky Lera, How language shapes thought, Scientific American, 304, 2, pp. 62-65, (2011); Bosson Jennifer K, Pinel Elizabeth C, Vandello Joseph A, The emotional impact of ambivalent sexism: Forecasts versus real experiences, Sex Roles, 62, 7, pp. 520-531, (2010); Briere John, Lanktree Cheryl, Sex-role related effects of sex bias in language, Sex roles, 9, 5, pp. 625-632, (1983); Bussey Kay, Bandura Albert, Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation, Psychological review, 106, 4, (1999); Cimpian Andrei, Mu Yan, Erickson Lucy C, Who is good at this game? linking an activity to a social category undermines children's achievement, Psychological science, 23, 5, pp. 533-541, (2012); Connor Rachel A, Glick Peter, Fiske Susan T, Ambivalent sexism in the twenty-first century, (2017); Cross Emily J, Overall Nickola C, Women's attraction to benevolent sexism: Needing relationship security predicts greater attraction to men who endorse benevolent sexism, European Journal of Social Psychology, 48, 3, pp. 336-347, (2018); Danks David, London Alex John, Algorithmic Bias in Autonomous Systems A Taxonomy of Algorithmic Bias, 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI- 17), (Ijcai), pp. 4691-4697, (2017); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, CoRR, pp. 4171-4186, (2018); Dressel Julia, Farid Hany, The accuracy, fairness, and limits of predicting recidivism, Science advances, 4, 1, (2018); Eagly H, WendyWood, Diekman Amanda B, Social role theory of sex differences and similarities: A current appraisal, pp. 123-174, (2000); Fagot Beverly I, Leinbach Mary D, Hagan Richard, Gender labeling and the adoption of sex-typed behaviors, Developmental Psychology, 22, 4, (1986); Foubert Oceane, Lemmens Maarten, Genderbiased neologisms: the case of man-x, Lexis.

These platforms provide opportunities to share opinions and suggestions about any socio-political events. Apart from seeking advantage, a person or community often misuses these platforms to post hate speech content. Content targeted towards casteism, racism, sexism, and insulting is called hate speech. The majority of the user are multilingual speakers knowing two or more languages. Out of them, English is the most known language. Knowing native language like Hindi and well-known languages like English, most social media users switch between Hindi and English while writing content on the social media platform. The phenomenon of mixing two languages like Hindi and English is called as Hindi English Code-mixed language. We have participated in HASOC subtask2 to classify Hi-En code mixed conversation in two classes as Hate Offensive (HOF) and Non-hate (NONE). We have experimented with various methods as Multilingual Bert (MBert), finetuned Pretrained Bert-base-uncased, an ensemble of Bert-base-uncased, XLNet and transfer learning-based approaches. We have analyzed that finetuned Bert-base-uncased has outperformed all other models.

This can lead to severe physical and psychological stress in young children and adolescents, leading to even suicides and negatively affecting social policies. Therefore, there is a significant need to identify and regulate harassing content posted on the Internet in a smart, automated, and accurate manner. With this aim, in this paper, we design and develop a hierarchical framework comprising machine learning algorithms in order of higher computational complexity to adaptatively switch among them for efficiently detecting hateful and abusive content. We combine simple machine learning models such as Naive Bayes/Logistic Regression classifiers with customized calibration and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, and compare them with the much stronger deep learning techniques. Our proposed hierarchical framework demonstrates a significant improvement of the automated detection of abusive contents in social networks with a relatively small twitter dataset in contrast with the deep learning-based counterpart, namely the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, training of which typically requires a much higher volume of labeled documents to detect abusive comments. © 2022 IEEE.","Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT); calibration; Cyberbully; Expectation-Maximization (EM); Naive Bayes; racism","Automation; Classifiers; Computational efficiency; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machinery; Maximum principle; Signal encoding; Social networking (online); Automated detection; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Cyberbully; Expectation Maximization; Expectation-maximization; Learning approach; Naive bayes; Online users; Physical stress; Racism; Calibration","","","","","Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia, (449)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this work through the project number 449.","Hamm M.P., Et al., Prevalence and effect of cyberbullying on children and young people: A scoping review of social media studies, JAMA pediatrics, 169, 8, pp. 770-777, (2015); Geiger A., How and why we studied teens and cyberbullying, Pew Research Center, (2018); Niu G., Et al., Cyberbullying victimization and adolescent depression: The mediating role of psychological security and the moderating role of growth mindset, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 12, (2020); Alam K.S., Bhowmik S., Prosun P.R.K., Cyberbullying detection: An ensemble based machine learning approach, 2021 Third International Conference on Intelligent Communication Technologies and Virtual Mobile Networks (ICICV), (2021); Behzadi M., Harris I.G., Derakhshan A., Rapid cyber-bullying detection method using compact BERT models, 2021 IEEE 15th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), (2021); Gada M., Damania K., Sankhe S., Cyberbullying detection using LSTM-CNN architecture and its applications, 2021 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), (2021); Tang D., Et al., Learning sentiment-specific word embedding for Twitter sentiment classification, ACL, pp. 1555-1565, (2014); Nguyen K., O'Connor B., Posterior calibration and exploratory analysis for natural language processing models, (2015); McCallum A.K., Multi-label text classification with a mixture model trained by EM, AAAI 99 Workshop on Text Learning, (1999); Founta A.-M., Et al., Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of Twitter abusive behavior, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; Huawei; LG; Qualcomm; Samsung; Technology Innovation Institute (TII)","2022 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2022","16 May 2022 through 20 May 2022","Seoul","182043","15503607","978-153868347-7","","","English","IEEE Int Conf Commun","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137271143"

The complexity of recognizing misogyny through computer models lies in the fact that it is a subtle type of violence, it is not always explicitly aggressive, and it can even hide behind seemingly flattering words, jokes, parodies, and other expressions. Cur-rently, it is even difficult to have an exact figure for the rate of misogynistic comments online because, unlike other types of violence, such as physical violence, these events are not registered by any statis-tical systems. This research contributes to the development of models for the automatic detection of misogynistic texts in Latin American Spanish and contributes to the design of data augmentation methodologies since the amount of data required for deep learning models is considerable. © 2021 by the authors.

The impact of comments has been investigated in several studies. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are just a few of the social media networks that are used to broadcast different news worldwide. In this paper, a comprehensive AI-based study is presented to automatically detect the Arabic text misogyny and sarcasm in binary and multiclass scenarios. The key of the proposed AI approach is to distinguish various topics of misogyny and sarcasm from Arabic tweets in social media networks. A comprehensive study is achieved for detecting both misogyny and sarcasm via adopting seven state-of-the-art NLP classifiers: ARABERT, PAC, LRC, RFC, LSVC, DTC, and KNNC. To fine tune, validate, and evaluate all of these techniques, two Arabic tweets datasets (i.e., misogyny and Abu Farah datasets) are used. For the experimental study, two scenarios are proposed for each case study (misogyny or sarcasm): binary and multiclass problems. For misogyny detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT classifier with 91.0% for binary classification scenario and 89.0% for the multiclass scenario. For sarcasm detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT as well with 88% for binary classification scenario and 77.0% for the multiclass scenario. The proposed method appears to be effective in detecting misogyny and sarcasm in social media platforms with suggesting AraBERT as a superior state-of-the-art deep learning classifier.  © 2022 Abdullah Y.

The main aim was to investigate whether the young people, as current and future designers and developers of technologies for older people, have ageist and sexist attitudes about older people as users of technology. A second aim was to investigate whether their attitudes differ from those of older people. Participants were shown a picture of either a young or old Chinese woman or man and asked to assess the likelihood that this person would use a desktop computer, laptop computer and a smartphone, and their level of expertise in each of these technologies. Both young and older Chinese people showed negative attitudes towards older adults compared to young ones as both users of and experts in technology, and negative attitudes towards women compared to men. However, there was only slight evidence of “double discrimination” towards older women, this was on use of the technologies rather than expertise with the technologies. These results show that young Chinese workers in technology need education in the characteristics and needs of their older potential audiences. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ageism; Perceptions of older Chinese people; Perceptions of older Chinese women; Perceptions of technology expertise; Perceptions of technology use; Sexism","Behavioral research; Engineering education; Ageism; Chinese people; Older People; Perception of old chinese people; Perception of old chinese woman; Perception of technology expertise; Perception of technology use; Sexism; Technology use; Workers'; Laptop computers","","","","","","","Ayalon L., Perceived age, gender, and racial/ethnic discrimination in Europe: Results from the European social survey, Educ.

With the advent of activism-related scholarship in HCI and CSCW, the current challenge involves thinking about what activism is, who an activist is, and the opportunities and limitations of activism. Recently, researchers in academia and industry, such as Timnit Gebru, demonstrate a commitment to stay activated for the structural changes we need, for example, diverse and inclusive scholarship, to address overlapping problems, e.g., sexism, racism, and tokenism. Additionally, there is a continuing dominance of Western, formally educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) perspectives. Countering this requires collective efforts in citational justice and decolonial computing, among others. But such complex issues do not yet cover the inner conflicts that we face, such as mental health struggles while dismantling the prejudices stemming from the ivory tower, locating our privileges as academics while traversing less privileged locales of research sites, or the dilemmas on whether we are doing enough to fulfill our responsibilities to the people who have trusted us enough to work with us in the face of ""publish or perish""culture. This workshop explores what activism means within the CSCW community and how we can remain activated while harboring doubts and hopes in calling ourselves ""activists"". © 2021 ACM.","Academia; Activism; Collective action; Social justice","'current; Academia; Activism; Collective action; Mental health; Publish or perish; Social justice; Groupware","","","","","","","Alabdulqader E., Abokhodair N., Lazem S., Humancomputer interaction across the arab world, Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1356-1359, (2017); Ali S.M., A brief introduction to decolonial computing, XRDS: Crossroads, the ACM Magazine for Students, 22, 4, pp. 16-21, (2016); Garcia A.A., Badillo-Urquiola K., Barrera MacHuca M.D., Cibrian F.L., Felice M.C., Gaytan-Lugo L.S., Gomez-Zara D., Griggio C.F., Perusquia-Hernandez M., Silva-Prietch S., Et al., Fostering HCI research in, by, and for Latin america, Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-4, (2020); Garcia A.A., Young A.L., Dombrowski L., On making data actionable: How activists use imperfect data to foster social change for human rights violations in Mexico, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 1, pp. 1-19, (2017); Asad M., Prefigurative design as a method for research justice, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 3, pp. 1-18, (2019); Bardzell S., Bardzell J., Towards a feminist HCI methodology: Social science, feminism, and HCI, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 675-684, (2011); Davies C.B., Left of Karl Marx, (2008); Erete S., Rankin Y.A., Thomas J.O., I can't breathe: Reflections from black women in CSCW and HCI, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 4, pp. 1-23, (2021); Esteva G., The Very Notion of Militancy Changed in Me, (2018); Irani L., Vertesi J., Dourish P., Philip K., Grinter R.E., Postcolonial computing: A lens on design and development, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1311-1320, (2010); Kumar N., Karusala N., Braving citational justice in human-computer interaction, Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-9, (2021); De Castro-Leal D., Strohmayer A., Kruger M., On activism and academia: Reflecting together and sharing experiences among critical friends, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2021); Lee M., Noortman R., Zaga C., Starke A., Huisman G., Andersen K., Conversational futures: Emancipating conversational interactions for futures worth wanting, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-13, (2021); Menendez-Blanco M., Bjorn P., De Angeli A., Fostering cooperative activism through critical design, Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, pp. 618-629, (2017); Saxena D., Graeff E., Guha S., Cheon E.J., Reynolds-Cuellar P., Walker D., Becker C., Fleischmann K.R., Collective organizing and social responsibility at CSCW, Conference Companion Publication of the 2020 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, pp. 503-509, (2020); Spiel K., Gerling K., Bennett C.L., Brule E., Williams R.M., Rode J., Mankoff J., Nothing about us without us: Investigating the role of critical disability studies in hci, Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-8, (2020); Strohmayer A., Bellini R., Meissner J., Finnigan S.M., Alabdulqader E., Toombs A., Balaam M., CHI versity: Implications for equality, diversity, and inclusion campaigns, Extended Abstracts of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-10, (2018)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGCHI","24th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, CSCW 2021","23 October 2021 through 27 October 2021","Virtual, Online","172900","","978-145038479-7","","","English","Proc.

Every big news before telecasting on television comes to these forums, therefore raises many dilemmas due to misinterpretation regarding the freedom of speaking. One of this trouble is social intimidation that is very disturbing misbehavior that can cause troubling consequences for the victim. Existing works of social intimidation focuses on only one or two topics of harassment. The main aim of this study is to analyze the hub of social intimidation i.e. twitter, consisting of 25,000 tweets covering five topics of harassment i.e. sexism, racism, appearance related, political and intellectual. Moreover, five machine learning and four deep learning techniques were used namely sequential minimal optimization (SMO), random forest, multinomial naïve bayes, logistic regression (LR), decision tree J48, CNN-CB, CNN-GRU, CNN-LRCN and CNN-Bi-LSTM. Each of the classifiers are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure as a performance metric on the dataset. Results indicate the dominance of CNN-Bi-LSTM and logistic regression among all classifiers used. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CNN-Bi-LSTM; CNN-CB; CNN-GRU; CNN-LRCN; J48; Logistic regression; Multinomial NB; SMO; Social intimidation","Classification (of information); Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Optimization; Random forests; CNN-bi-LSTM; CNN-CB; CNN-GRU; CNN-LRCN; J48; Logistics regressions; Multinomial NB; Multinomials; Sequential minimal optimization; Social intimidation; Decision trees","","","","","","","Patchin J.W., Hinduja S., It is time to teach safe sexting, J.

Most automatic hate speech detection approaches cast the problem into a binary classification task without addressing either the topical focus or the target-oriented nature of hate speech. In this paper, we propose to tackle, for the first time, hate speech detection from a multi-target perspective. We leverage manually annotated datasets, to investigate the problem of transferring knowledge from different datasets with different topical focuses and targets. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we explore the ability of hate speech detection models to capture common properties from topic-generic datasets and transfer this knowledge to recognize specific manifestations of hate speech; (2) we experiment with the development of models to detect both topics (racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny) and hate speech targets, going beyond standard binary classification, to investigate how to detect hate speech at a finer level of granularity and how to transfer knowledge across different topics and targets; and (3) we study the impact of affective knowledge encoded in sentic computing resources (SenticNet, EmoSenticNet) and in semantically structured hate lexicons (HurtLex) in determining specific manifestations of hate speech. We experimented with different neural models including multitask approaches. Our study shows that: (1) training a model on a combination of several (training sets from several) topic-specific datasets is more effective than training a model on a topic-generic dataset; (2) the multi-task approach outperforms a single-task model when detecting both the hatefulness of a tweet and its topical focus in the context of a multi-label classification approach; and (3) the models incorporating EmoSenticNet emotions, the first level emotions of SenticNet, a blend of SenticNet and EmoSenticNet emotions or affective features based on Hurtlex, obtained the best results. Our results demonstrate that multi-target hate speech detection from existing datasets is feasible, which is a first step towards hate speech detection for a specific topic/target when dedicated annotated data are missing. Moreover, we prove that domain-independent affective knowledge, injected into our models, helps finer-grained hate speech detection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Affective resources; Hate speech detection; Hate speech targets; Multi-task learning; Social media","Classification (of information); Knowledge management; Speech; Speech communication; Annotated datasets; Binary classification; Domain independents; Multi label classification; On-line communication; Sexual orientations; Social media platforms; Vulnerable groups; Speech recognition","","","","","Federal University of Toulouse Midi-Pyr?; Federal University of Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées; Università degli Studi di Torino, UNITO","Funding text 1: The work of Endang W.

Existing 'Stereotype Detection' datasets mainly adopt a diagnostic approach toward large PLMs. Blodgett et al. (2021a) show that there are significant reliability issues with the existing benchmark datasets. Annotating a reliable dataset requires a precise understanding of the subtle nuances of how stereotypes manifest in text. In this paper, we annotate a focused evaluation set for 'Stereotype Detection' that addresses those pitfalls by de-constructing various ways in which stereotypes manifest in text. Further, we present a multi-task model that leverages the abundance of data-rich neighboring tasks such as hate speech detection, offensive language detection, misogyny detection, etc., to improve the empirical performance on 'Stereotype Detection'. We then propose a reinforcement-learning agent that guides the multi-task learning model by learning to identify the training examples from the neighboring tasks that help the target task the most. We show that the proposed models achieve significant empirical gains over existing baselines on all the tasks. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Large dataset; Learning systems; Speech recognition; Benchmark datasets; Diagnostic approach; Language model; Large amounts of data; Learning frameworks; Multi-task model; Multitask learning; Offensive languages; Sharp focus; Speech detection; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Badjatiya Pinkesh, Gupta Manish, Varma Vasudeva, Stereotypical bias removal for hate speech detection task using knowledge-based generalizations, The World Wide Web Conference, pp. 49-59, (2019); Berk Richard A., An impact assessment of machine learning risk forecasts on parole board decisions and recidivism, Journal of Experimental Criminology, 13, pp. 193-216, (2017); Blodgett Su Lin, Lopez Gilsinia, Olteanu Alexandra, Sim Robert, Wallach Hanna, Stereotyping norwegian salmon: An inventory of pitfalls in fairness benchmark datasets, ACL-IJCNLP 2021, (2021); Lin Blodgett Su, Lopez Gilsinia, Olteanu Alexandra, Sim Robert, Wallach Hanna, Stereotyping Norwegian salmon: An inventory of pitfalls in fairness benchmark datasets, Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1004-1015, (2021); Brown Tom B., Mann Benjamin, Ryder Nick, Subbiah Melanie, Kaplan Jared, Dhariwal Prafulla, Neelakantan Arvind, Shyam Pranav, Sastry Girish, Askell Amanda, Agarwal Sandhini, Herbert-Voss Ariel, Krueger Gretchen, Henighan Tom, Child Rewon, Ramesh Aditya, Ziegler Daniel M., Wu Jeffrey, Winter Clemens, Hesse Christopher, Chen Mark, Sigler Eric, Litwin Mateusz, Gray Scott, Chess Benjamin, Clark Jack, Berner Christopher, McCandlish Sam, Radford Alec, Sutskever Ilya, Amodei Dario, Language models are few-shot learners, (2020); Cardwell Mike, Dictionary of psychology, (1996); Caruana Rich, Multitask learning, Machine learning, 28, 1, pp. 41-75, (1997); Czopp Alexander, When is a compliment not a compliment? evaluating expressions of positive stereotypes, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44, pp. 413-420, (2008); Davidson Thomas, Warmsley Dana, Macy Michael, Weber Ingmar, Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, Proceedings of the 11th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, ICWSM'17, pp. 512-515, (2017); de Gibert Ona, Perez Naiara, Garcia-Pablos Aitor, Cuadros Montse, Hate Speech Dataset from a White Supremacy Forum, Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Abusive Language Online (ALW2), pp. 11-20, (2018); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Duong Long, Cohn Trevor, Bird Steven, Cook Paul, Low resource dependency parsing: Cross-lingual parameter sharing in a neural network parser, Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 2: Short Papers), pp. 845-850, (2015); Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Anzovino Maria, Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018, IberEval@ SEPLN, pp. 214-228, (2018); Fortuna Paula, Nunes Sergio, A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text, ACM Comput.

Misogyny is a form of hate speech that denigrates a person or a group that identifies as feminine; it is generally described as hatred or contempt towards women. Arab women exposed to many forms of online misogyny, which sadly reinforces and justifies gender inequality, inferior social standing, sexual assault, violence, maltreatment, and underestimating. This paper proposes three methods to identify and classify misogyny behavior from Arabic tweets: (i) BERT, (ii) Ensemble-based model, and (iii) Dense Neural Network-based model. The suggested approach performs admirably on both tasks. The BERT model outperformed the other two suggested methods for misogyny identification, with an accuracy of 0.883, while the ensemble-based approach outperformed the other two suggested methods for misogyny behavior classification task, with an accuracy of 0.764. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Arabic tweets; BERT; Deep learning; Ensemble model; Misogyny","Learning systems; Arabic tweet; BERT; Deep learning; Ensemble models; Exposed to; Learning approach; Misogyny; Network-based modeling; Neural-networks; Sexual assault; Deep learning","","","","","","","Kumar A., Rathore N.

We find that current bias detection methods in NLP are insufficient to determine gender bias in our case law database and propose an alternative approach. We show that existing algorithms' inconsistent results are consequences of prior research's inconsistent definitions of biases themselves. Bias detection algorithms rely on groups of words to represent bias (e.g., 'salary,' 'job,' and 'boss' to represent employment as a potentially biased theme against women in text). However, the methods to build these groups of words have several weaknesses, primarily that the word lists are based on the researchers' own intuitions. We suggest two new methods of automating the creation of word lists to represent biases. We find that our methods outperform current NLP bias detection methods. Our research improves the capabilities of NLP technology to detect bias and highlights gender biases present in influential case law. In order to test our NLP bias detection method's performance, we regress our results of bias in case law against U.S census data of women's participation in the workforce in the last 100 years.  ©2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Compensation (personnel); Population statistics; 'current; Case law; Census data; Detection algorithm; Detection methods; Gender bias; Judicial systems; Performance; Word lists; Natural language processing systems","","","","","","","Beukeboom Camiel J., Burgers Christian, How Stereotypes Are Shared Through Language: A Review and Introduction of the Social Categories and Stereotypes Communication (SCSC) Framework, Review of Communication Research, 7, pp. 1-37, (2019); Bolukbasi Tolga, Chang Kai-Wei, Zou James Y, Saligrama Venkatesh, Kalai Adam T, Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?

However, the ‘prelife’ and ‘afterlife’ of these themes in the men’s rights movement indicates the ways in which discourses persist across time and media formats despite ‘platform death.’ This has implications for how we understand and contextualize the contemporary men’s rights movement and highlights the limitations of platform-focused responses to online misogyny and extremism. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","gender; Men’s rights movement; misogyny; platforms; rights; Usenet","","","","","","","","(1856); Options: A Publication of Free Men, Inc.

The offensive contents on social media may target a religion, community, individual or group of people, with specific thoughts and beliefs. A category of offensive content targeting women termed as Misogyny is increasing day-by-day and a person/group who shares such content is called a Misogynist. Misogyny detection can be seen as a sub-category of HS and Offensive Language Identification (OLI) tasks in which women and issues regarding them such as their rights are targeted. Despite the several works undertaken for HS and OLI tasks by several researchers, Misogyny detection has been studied rarely even for rich resource languages. To promote Misogyny detection in Arabic language, Arabic Misogyny Identification (ArMI)a shared task in Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2021 provides the dataset and invites the researches to develop models for Misogyny detection in the given text. The shared task consists of two subtasks which can be modeled as binary and multiclass Text Classification (TC) tasks. This paper describes the models submitted by our team MUCIC to the ArMI shared task. The proposed methodology uses a combination of top frequent char and word n-grams as features to train Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and obtained an accuracy of 0.873 and F1-score of 0.497 for Subtask A and B respectively. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Hate Speech; Machine Learning; Misogyny Detection; Offensive Language; Social Media","Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Social networking (online); Text processing; Arabic languages; Hate speech; Language identification; Machine-learning; Misogyny detection; Offensive languages; Retrieval evaluation; Social media; Subtask; Text classification; Machine learning","","","","","","","Balouchzahi F., Aparna B.

In this paper, we present a new multilingual hate speech analysis dataset for English, Hindi, Arabic, French, German and Spanish languages for multiple domains across hate speech - Abuse, Racism, Sexism, Religious Hate and Extremism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of identifying various types of hate speech in these five wide domains in these six languages. In this work, we describe how we created the dataset, created annotations at high level and low level for different domains and how we use it to test the current state-of-the-art multilingual and multitask learning approaches. We evaluate our dataset in various monolingual, cross-lingual and machine translation classification settings and compare it against open source English datasets that we aggregated and merged for this task. Then we discuss how this approach can be used to create large scale hate-speech datasets and how to leverage our annotations in order to improve hate speech detection and classification in general. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

So we will train 3 times the same base model, generating 3 versions of the model. A normal version, a sexist version and an anti-sexist version.

Alas, the platform has also come under fire for hosting inappropriate, toxic, and hateful content. One community that has often been linked to sharing and publishing hateful and misogynistic content are the Involuntary Celibates (Incels), a loosely defined movement ostensibly focusing on men's issues. In this paper, we set out to analyze the Incel community on YouTube by focusing on this community's evolution over the last decade and understanding whether YouTube's recommendation algorithm steers users towards Incel-related videos. We collect videos shared on Incel communities within Reddit and perform a data-driven characterization of the content posted on YouTube. Among other things, we find that the Incel community on YouTube is getting traction and that, during the last decade, the number of Incel-related videos and comments rose substantially. We also find that users have a 6.3% chance of being suggested an Incel-related video by YouTube's recommendation algorithm within five hops when starting from a non Incel-related video. Overall, our findings paint an alarming picture of online radicalization: not only Incel activity is increasing over time, but platforms may also play an active role in steering users towards such extreme content.  © 2021 ACM.","Incels; involuntary celibates; manosphere; misogyny; reddit; YouTube recommendation algorithm","Involuntary celibate; Manosphere; Misogyny; Recommendation algorithms; Reddit; User-generated video; Video contents; YouTube; Youtube recommendation algorithm; Websites","","","","","Marie Skłdowska-Curie; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1942610, 2046590, 2114407, 2114411, EP/V011189/1); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691025, 830927)","This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program under the Marie Skłdowska-Curie ENCASE project (GA No. 691025) and the CONCORDIA project (GA No. 830927), the US National Science Foundation (grants: 1942610, 2114407, 2114411, and 2046590), and the UK’s National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction, and Adversarial Influence Online (UKRI grant: EP/V011189/1).

One way of improving model robustness is to generate counterfactually augmented data (CAD) for training models that can better learn to distinguish between core features and data artifacts. While models trained on this type of data have shown promising out-of-domain generalizability, it is still unclear what the sources of such improvements are. We investigate the benefits of CAD for social NLP models by focusing on three social computing constructs - sentiment, sexism, and hate speech. Assessing the performance of models trained with and without CAD across different types of datasets, we find that while models trained on CAD show lower in-domain performance, they generalize better out-of-domain. We unpack this apparent discrepancy using machine explanations and find that CAD reduces model reliance on spurious features. Leveraging a novel typology of CAD to analyze their relationship with model performance, we find that CAD which acts on the construct directly or a diverse set of CAD leads to higher performance. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Computational linguistics; Computer aided design; Content detection; Core datum; Core features; Data artifacts; Learn+; Model robustness; Performance; Social computing; Spurious features; Training model; Natural language processing systems","","","","","Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond, DFF","We thank members of the CopeNLU group and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.

Given the increase in right-wing political ""news""sites as originators of trolling activity and their propensity to espouse anti-intellectualism, we are interested in understanding more deeply how particular instances of this targeted outrage become rhetorical. Our analysis reveals how metaknowledge circulates misinformation through commentary that carries anti-intellectual ideologies rapidly across time and space. This process of detachment reveals important implications about the (re)production of anti-intellectual ideologies, the evocation of collective outrage that manifests as sexism and transphobia, and the gatekeeping of academic knowledge production.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

A scale to measure endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women was developed to be inclusive of the many contemporary ways that women are targeted online. We examined sociopolitical ideologies (right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) and perceived threats (based on the Dual Process Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice, as well as Integrated Threat Theory) as predictors of endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women in three studies (Pilot Study, n = 46; Study 1, n = 276; Study 2, n = 6381). Study 1 and 2 participants were recruited from online video gaming communities; Study 2 comprised responses collected during or after a livestream of YouTubers doing the survey went viral. The YouTubers criticized feminism and alleged that female gamers had privilege in the gaming community. In all three studies, exploratory factor analyses suggested endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women is a unidimensional psychological construct and the scale demonstrated great internal reliability. In path analyses, social dominance orientation emerged as the most consistent predictor of endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women, mediated, in part, by perceived threats. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cyberbullying; Harassment; Intergroup attitudes; Political ideology; Sexism; Video games","Human computer interaction; Regression analysis; Cyber bullying; Dual process; Harassment; Intergroup attitude; Online video; Pilot studies; Political ideologies; Sexism; Sexual harassment; Video-games; adult; article; authority; cyberbullying; exploratory factor analysis; female; feminism; human; human experiment; ideology; major clinical study; path analysis; pilot study; prejudice; reliability; sexism; social dominance; theoretical study; video game; wing; Factor analysis","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Arvin Jagayat is supported in part by funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council .

We submitted three runs for each task, two of them based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) exploring different edge creation strategies and one combining graph embeddings from different GCN through ensemble methods. In addition, we explored different GCN models and text-to- graph strategies. We identified that in Task 2 the models take advantage of the syntactic relationship between words encoded in the graph, while it did not strongly impact Task 1. Moreover, the models generalized the task while maintaining similar (in some cases better) results in the social network that was not used in training. On average, our best models performed similarly across languages and social media, ranking 37th (out of 72 runs) for Task 1 and 40th (out of 63) for Task 2. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

The user has freedom to post whatever he/she likes in social networking and blogging sites. However, sometimes the content when directed towards certain group of individuals with an intention to incite hate or discrimination, causes a turmoil in the society. Such content is known as hate speech. Hate speech can be a serious problem to peace and harmony in the society. There are instances where hate speech have led to social unrest and extremism. Thus, hate speech in the internet needs to be monitored. In this paper, we discuss the relevant works done in the field of hate speech detection. Different types of hate speech like racism, sexism, religious hate speech, etc. and the various methods proposed to tackle them are discussed. Further, we identify the challenges and propose the solutions to challenges in hate speech detection in the public internet sphere.  © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Racism; Sexism","Natural language processing systems; Speech; Blogging; Common platform; Internet needs; NAtural language processing; Public internet; Speech detection; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Ghimire A., Thapa S., Jha A.K., Adhikari S., Kumar A., Accelerating business growth with big data and artificial intelligence, 2020 Fourth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 441-448, (2020); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Cyber hate speech on twitter: An application of machine classification and statistical modeling for policy and decision making, Policy & Internet, 7, 2, pp. 223-242, (2015); Del Vigna F., Cimino A., Dell'Orletta F., Petrocchi M., Tesconi M., Hate me, hate me not: Hate speech detection on facebook, Proceedings of the First Italian Conference on Cybersecurity (ITASEC17), pp. 86-95, (2017); Banks J., Regulating hate speech online, International Review of Law, Computers & Technology, 24, 3, pp. 233-239, (2010); The Number of Tweets per Day in, (2020); Adhikari S., Thapa S., Singh P., Huo A., Bharathy G., Prasad M., A comparative study of machine learning and nlp techniques for uses of stop words by patients in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 1-8, (2021); Thapa S., Adhikari S., Ghimire A., Aditya A., Feature selection based twin-support vector machine for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, 2020 IEEE 8th R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC), (2020); Malmasi S., Zampieri M., Detecting Hate Speech in Social Media, (2017); Cao R., Lee R.K.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 11-20, (2020); Park J.H., Fung P., One-step and Two-step Classification for Abusive Language Detection on Twitter, (2017); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 11, 1, (2017); Founta A., Et al., Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of twitter abusive behavior, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 12, 1, (2018); Gamback B., Sikdar U.K., Using convolutional neural networks to classify hate-speech, Proceedings of the First Workshop on Abusive Language Online, pp. 85-90, (2017); De Gibert O., Perez N., Garcia-Pablos A., Cuadros M., Hate Speech Dataset from A White Supremacy Forum, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people. predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter, Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pp. 88-93, (2016); Pitsilis G.K., Ramampiaro H., Langseth H., Effective hate-speech detection in twitter data using recurrent neural networks, Applied Intelligence, 48, 12, pp. 4730-4742, (2018); Bartlett J., Reffin J., Rumball N., Williamson S., Anti-social media, Demos, 2014, pp. 1-51, (2014); Calderon C.A., De La Vega G., Herrero D.B., Topic modeling and characterization of hate speech against immigrants on twitter around the emergence of a far-right party in Spain, Social Sciences, 9, 11, (2020); Warner W., Hirschberg J., Detecting hate speech on the world wide web, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Language in Social Media, pp. 19-26, (2012); Basile V., Et al., Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter, 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63, (2019); Albadi N., Kurdi M., Mishra S., Are they our brothers.

Social networks offer a unique opportunity to increase channels for communication and socialization. The aim of this study is to analyze the adolescents’ attitudes in sports practice in their extracurricular environment, and it highlights the importance of didactic communication as a tool for social cohesion to guarantee the interaction between adolescents. This objective has been evaluated through the “Sport and Social Integration. Survey on Secondary Schools in Italy” questionnaire. In this paper, we focus our attention on Section II to go deeper into the participants’ opinion on previously mentioned social problems. The methods of research for this study were conducted through a descriptive, inferential, quantitative, and ex post facto design. The sample consisted of 286 Italian adolescents aged between 12 and 15 years old. Results show that there are positive correlations in the following variables: Gender and verbal, psychological, or physical violence (Bullying) (r = 0.260) (Sig. = 0.000); gender and threats, crimes, and persecutions through the Internet (Cyberbullying) (r = 0.226) (Sig. = 0.000); gender and discrimination against women (Sexism) (r = 0.133) (Sig. = 0.025). In conclusion, this article underlines the importance of investing more systematically in the effort to prevent bullying and digital inclusion from an early age for the critical use of mobile devices and social networks. © 2021 by the authors.

To better understand the online manifestations of this type of hate, and to propose methods that can automatically identify it, in this paper, we conduct a study on 4 cases of Black women in Tech reporting experiences of misogynoir on the Twitter platform. We follow the reactions to these cases (both supportive and non-supportive responses), and categorise them within a model of misogynoir that highlights experiences of Tone Policing, White Centring, Racial Gaslighting and Defensiveness. As an intersectional form of abusive or hateful speech, we investigate the possibilities and challenges to detect online instances of misogynoir in an automated way. We then conduct a closer qualitative analysis on messages of support and non-support to look at some of these categories in more detail. The purpose of this investigation is to understand responses to misogynoir online, including doubling down on misogynoir, engaging in performative allyship, and showing solidarity with Black women in tech. © 2021 ACM.","misogynoir; public response; social media","Doublings; Misogynoir; Public response; Qualitative analysis; Social media; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Bailey M., Trudy, On misogynoir: Citation, erasure, and plagiarism, Feminist Media Studies, 18, 4, pp. 762-768, (2018); Trudy, Explanation of misogynoir, Gradient Lair, (2014); Epstein R., Blake J., Gonzalez T., Girlhood Interrupted: The Erasure of Black Girls' Childhood, (2017); Tan Y.C., Celis L.E., Assessing social and intersectional biases in contextualized word representations, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 13230-13241, (2019); Madden S., Janoske M., Winkler R.B., Edgar A.N., Mediated misogynoir: Intersecting race and gender in online harassment, Mediating Misogyny.

Owing to the popularity of the situational comedy (sitcom) genre, it contributes significantly to the overall development of society. In an effort to analyze the content of television shows belonging to this genre, we present a dataset of dialogue turns from popular sitcoms annotated for the presence of sexist remarks. We train a text classification model to detect sexism using domain adaptive learning. We apply the model to our dataset to analyze the evolution of sexist content over the years. We propose a domain-specific semi-supervised architecture for the aforementioned detection of sexism. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model often yields better classification performance over generic deep learning based sentence classification that does not employ domain-specific training. We find that while sexism decreases over time on average, the proportion of sexist dialogue for the most sexist sitcom actually increases.. A quantitative analysis along with a detailed error analysis presents the case for our proposed methodology. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Text processing; Adaptive learning; Classification performance; Domain specific; Semi-supervised; Sentence classifications; Television shows; Text classification models; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Brewington Morgan, Is sexism taking on new forms in movies? an ambivalent sexism perspective, (2019); Chen Jiaao, Yang Zichao, Yang Diyi, Mix-text: Linguistically-informed interpolation of hidden space for semi-supervised text classification, (2020); Chiril Patricia, Moriceau Veronique, Benamara Farah, Mari Alda, Origgi Gloria, Coulomb-Gully Marlene, An annotated corpus for sexism detection in French tweets, Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 1397-1403, (2020); Chowdhury Arijit Ghosh, Sawhney Ramit, Shah Rajiv, Mahata Debanjan, # youtoo? detection of personal recollections of sexual harassment on social media, Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 2527-2537, (2019); Cohen Jacob, A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Gala Dhruvil, Khursheed Mohammad Omar, Lerner Hannah, O'Connor Brendan, Iyyer Mohit, Analyzing gender bias within narrative tropes, (2020); Glascock Jack, Viewer perception of gender roles on network prime-time television, Communication Research Reports, 20, 2, pp. 173-181, (2003); Glick Peter, Fiske Susan T, The ambivalent sexism inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism, Journal of personality and social psychology, 70, 3, (1996); James Deborah, Gender-linked derogatory terms and their use by women and men, American Speech, 73, 4, pp. 399-420, (1998); Jha Akshita, Mamidi Radhika, When does a compliment become sexist? analysis and classification of ambivalent sexism using twitter data, (2017); Lauzen Martha M, Dozier David M, Horan Nora, Constructing gender stereotypes through social roles in prime-time television, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 52, 2, pp. 200-214, (2008); Lee Nayeon, Bang Yejin, Shin Jamin, Fung Pascale, Understanding the shades of sexism in popular TV series, Proceedings of the 2019 Workshop on Widening NLP, pp. 122-125, (2019); Lee Nayeon, Bang Yejin, Shin Jamin, Fung Pascale, Understanding the shades of sexism in popular TV series, Proceedings of the 2019 Workshop on Widening NLP, pp. 122-125, (2019); Mishra Pushkar, Tredici Marco Del, Yannakoudakis Helen, Shutova Ekaterina, Author profiling for abuse detection, (2018); Mouka Effie, Saridakis Ioannis, Racism goes to the movies: A corpus-driven study of cross-linguistic racist discourse annotation and translation analysis, pp. 35-69, (2015); Nayef Heba, Linguistic sexism in tv drama: A linguistic analysis of verbal violence against women in the egyptian sitcom al-kabeer awi, International Journal of Linguistics, 4, 1, pp. 84-103, (2016); O'Kelly Charlotte G., Sexism in children's television, Journalism Quarterly, 51, 4, pp. 722-724, (1974); Sharifirad Sima, Jafarpour Borna, Matwin Stan, How is your mood when writing sexist tweets? detecting the emotion type and intensity of emotion using natural language processing techniques, (2019); Sink Alexander, Mastro Dana, Depictions of gender on primetime television: A quantitative content analysis, Mass Communication and Society, 20, 1, pp. 3-22, (2017); Villani Susan, Impact of media on children and adolescents: a 10-year review of the research, Journal of the American Academy of child & adolescent psychiatry, 40, 4, pp. 392-401, (2001); Waseem Zeerak, Hovy Dirk, Hateful symbols or hateful people? predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter, Proceedings of the NAACL student research workshop, pp. 88-93, (2016); Xie Qizhe, Dai Zihang, Hovy Eduard, Luong Minh-Thang, Le Quoc V, Unsupervised data augmentation for consistency training, (2019); Xu Huimin, Zhang Zhang, Wu Lingfei, Wang Cheng-Jun, The cinderella complex: Word embeddings reveal gender stereotypes in movies and books, PloS one, 14, 11, (2019); Zhai Xiaohua, Oliver Avital, Kolesnikov Alexander, Beyer Lucas, S4l: Self-supervised semisupervised learning, Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pp. 1476-1485, (2019)","S.

However, social media platforms have been used maliciously and subsequently lead to cyberbullying. Detecting cyberbullying manually is almost impossible due to massive data generated by social media users daily. Several strategies including opinion mining methods, machine learning techniques and deleting fake profiles have been utilized to deal with cyberbullying on social media platforms. However, due to the nature and structure of datasets as well as the language used, it is tremendously becoming difficult to detect cyberbullying. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive review of deep learning models applied to detect cyberbullying on various social media platforms. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, recurrent neural networks and bidirectional gated recurrent unit are predominantly used to detect different forms of cyberbullying such as hate speech, harassment, sexism, bullying among others. The study also revealed that cyberbullying causes psychological effects such as stress, anxiety, worthlessness, depression, reduced self-esteem, suicidal ideation and psychological distress, frustration, sleep-related issues and psychosis. This study also revealed that the majority of deep learning-based cyberbullying detection models utilized Twitter textual dataset. In the future, there is a need to utilize multimedia data such as images, audio and videos from various social media platforms to effectively develop cyberbullying detection models that can automatically detect all forms of bullying. This can tremendously assist law enforcement agencies to curb the menace of cyberbullying on various social media platforms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cyberbullying; Deep learning; Detection; Social media networks","","","","","","","","Beale A.V., Hall K.R., Cyberbullying: What School Administrators (and Parents) Can Do, Clear.

Moreover, ease of access to social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. has led to an exponential increase in the mistreatment of people in the form of hateful messages, bullying, sexism, racism, aggressive content, harassment, toxic comment etc. Thus there is an extensive need to identify, control and reduce the bullying contents spread over social media sites, which has motivated us to conduct this research to automate the detection process of offensive language or cyberbullying. Our main aim is to build single and double ensemble-based voting model to classify the contents into two groups: 'offensive' or 'non-offensive'. For this purpose, we have chosen four machine learning classifiers and three ensemble models with two different feature extraction techniques combined with various n-gram analysis on a dataset extracted from Twitter. In our work, Logistic Regression and Bagging ensemble model classifier have performed individually best in detecting cyberbullying which has been outperformed by our proposed SLE and DLE voting classifiers. Our proposed SLE and DLE models yield the best performance of 96% when TF-IDF (Unigram) feature extraction is applied with K-Fold cross-validation. © 2021 IEEE.","Cyberbullying; Machine Learning Classifiers; Offensive Language; Text Classification; Twitter","Cellular radio systems; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Extraction; Feature extraction; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Detection process; Exponential increase; Feature extraction techniques; K fold cross validations; Machine learning approaches; Offensive languages; Social media platforms; Voting classifiers; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Schmidt A., Wiegand M., A Survey on Hate Speech Detection Using Natural Language Processing, pp. 1-10, (2017); Niu G., He J., Lin S., Sun X., Longobardi C., Cyberbullying victimization and adolescent depression: The mediating role of psychological security and the moderating role of growth mindset, Int.

From questioning the victims' credibility to taking a neutral position while waiting for further development, gamers and fans made use of digital platforms to express either concern, astonishment, or doubt; these reactions point to the significant symbolic capital that Soule possesses in the context of video game music. The Elder Scrolls franchise, and in particular Skyrim, is highly recognized for its soundtracks, and this franchise has given rise to the largest mods community to date. In previous research, I examined this mods community in order to consider music and sound in relation to immersion and modification in Elder Scrolls games. Since the data collected in that earlier research was limited to a time span until 2017, the recent developments concerning composer Jeremy Soule weren't addressed in that earlier setting. However, these allegations were part of a larger phenomenon of awareness and public exposure of negative and abusive practices in several labor contexts in the video game industry, shedding some light on a much-needed discussion about sexism and mistreatment toward women and nonbinary professionals in these fields and raising some pertinent questions concerning users' feedback and engagement. This article aims to discuss the possible impacts these accusations had on the relationship between Soule's music and users in the mods community, including users' overviews of their own personal affective engagement with the games, thus verifying the deep connection between music, interactivity, authorship and gamer identity. © 2022 by the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games.

Ideally, a chatbot is void of racism, sexism, or any other offensive speech, however several well-known public instances indicate otherwise (e.g., Microsoft Taybot). In this paper, we explore the mechanisms of how open source conversational chatbots can learn bias, and we investigate potential solutions to mitigate this learned bias. To this end, we developed the Chatbot Bias Assessment Framework to measure bias in conversational chatbots, and then we devised an approach based on counter-stereotypic imagining to reduce this bias. This approach is non-intrusive to the chatbot, since it does not require altering any AI code or deleting any data from the original training dataset.  © 2022 IEEE.","AI; chatbot; ethics; NLP","Chatbots; Humaninteraction; Learn+; MicroSoft; Non-intrusive; Open-source; Training dataset","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (281301)","","Vincent J., Twitter taught Microsoft's AI Chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day, (2016); Han X., Et al., Designing Efective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging, ACM CHI Virtual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2021); Srivastava B., Et al., Personalized Chatbot Trustworthiness Ratings, IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society, 4, (2020); Zhong S., Et al., How To Evaluate Single-Round Dialogues Like Humans: An Information-Oriented Metric, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 28, (2020); Srivastava B., Et al., Rating AI systems for bias to promote trustable applications, IBM Journal of Research and Development, 63, 4-5, (2019); Hanu L., Et al., How AI is Learning to Identify Toxic Online Content, Scientific American Online, (2021); Chatterbot, Github; Shekhar A., Chatbot Using Deep Learning in Python, CodeSpeedy; Chai Y., Et al., How to Keep an Online Learning Chatbot from Being Corrupted, IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, (2020); Treml F., How to Test a Chatbot - Part 1: Why is it so Hard?, Chatbot Magazine, (2018); Fauzia M., Fact Check"" Facebook didn't pull the plug on two chatbots because they created a language, USA Today, (2021); McKay T., No, Facebook Did Not Panic and Shut Down an AI Program That Was Getting Dangerously Smart; Kempf A., If We Are Going to Talk About Implicit Race Bias, We Need to Talk About Structural Racism: Moving Beyond Ubiquity and Inevitability in Teaching and Learning About Race, Taboo: The Journal of Culture and Education, 19, 2, (2020); Khan A., Why is Education Industry opting for AI Chatbots?

In this paper, we describe the participation of the QMUL-SDS team in EXIST. We propose an architecture made of the last 4 hidden states of XLM-RoBERTa and a TextCNN with 3 kernels. Our model also exploits lexical features relying on the use of new and existing lexicons of abusive words, with a special focus on sexist slurs and abusive words targeting women. Our team ranked 11th in Subtask 1 and 4th in Sub- task 2 among all the teams on the leaderboard, clearly outperforming the baselines offered by EXIST. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

This article delves into the collective story that memes offer of this context and aims to establish a categorization that can be used for comparison with other countries. We carried out a content analysis of 636 Spanish political memes published on Twitter throughout 2020. Current affairs were taken into account, as well as the frame, and rhetorical elements, references to popular culture, and symbols. We also took into consideration the objectives of the message and the presence of offensive content. We demonstrate that these memes do not play a subversive role, but rather contribute to the polarization and fragmentation of the digital public, echoing the existing ideological confrontation. They do not deliver new ideas, but only reproduce expressions and disqualifications already existing in the society, although the disinhibition of anonymity magnifies the intensity. Current affairs are an excuse to convey ideological position, and political communication becomes more emotional. There are no significant differences in terms of political polarization between left and right, and criticism toward politicians is mainly of personal and moral nature. Hate speech on other social media appears in these cultural creations, highlighting the misogyny toward women politicians regardless of their political party. The rhetorical and expressive resources are adapted to this confrontation, and there is little innovation because it is subject to the understanding of the message. © The Author(s) 2021.","frames; hate speech; memes; politics; Spain","","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was made within the framework of the research project PID2019-105613GB-C31 “Mapping of Hate Speech in Spain”, funded by The Ministry of Science and Innovation (Spain).

In India, men and women are witnessing gender discrimination for generations, affecting the lives of both genders. This review paper focuses on past studies of gender role portrayal in Indian advertisement to comprehend the contemporary situation of gender representation. Around thirty articles have been analyzed between the years 2000 and 2020. The article and conference papers that are published in the English language have been considered for the undertaken study. Based upon the study, the magazine print advertisement shows that gender stereotype still exists in Indian advertisements. The findings of the study reveal that stereotype portrayal of gender is used in different product categories. Moreover, sexism and degrading portrayal of women are used to sell product in Indian advertisement. Some researchers also observed a slight improvement in women representation in Indian advertisements.

In this environment, it is critical that VoIP represent everybody’s voices with equal fidelity. This will allow all demographics to have the opportunity for equal participation. This research investigated whether there was evidence of sexism in the way VoIP compresses vocal data. This was accomplished by measuring the similarity of a large database of vocal samples between their original and compressed forms and statistically comparing their differences between females and males. Multiple measure showed significant evidence of reduced audio quality for female voices compared to male voices.

In one such contradiction, popular feminism has led women to expect the successful negotiation of sexual consent, while popular misogyny permits the circulation of traditional sexual scripts that disregard the necessity of consent. In this study, we analyze messages conveyed through digitized narratives of sexual consent posted on Tumblr, a social media site that is popular among feminist activists, to identify the ways that users construct meaning around the dissonance between expectations for consent and the inequalities that inhibit its negotiation. We specifically explore whether hashtag feminism navigates postfeminist contradictions in a way that simultaneously calls out misogyny and calls on feminism. We find that the Tumblr posts in our sample did both, albeit in a manner that failed to offer tangible solutions to the problem at hand. Calls on feminism were largely limited to tagging feminist allies and recirculating existing feminist campaigns. Thus, we argue that the hashtag ultimately became a handoff to a larger feminist abstraction. Future research should explore conditions under which activists link tangible issues, actors, and agendas to an otherwise abstract popular feminism. © The Author(s) 2021.","hashtag feminism; misogyny;

Without honest conversations about power relations within the field of Computing, one cannot expect to engender social change that equates to equity for all CS students. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework, we interview 18 Black women about their experiences navigating the computing education ecosystem. Intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three saturated sites of violence within CS education: 1. traditional K-12 classrooms; 2. predominantly White institutions; and 3. internships as supplementary learning experiences. © 2021 Owner/Author.","black women; epistemic violence; intersectional computing","Computer science; Computers; Computing education; CS education; Learning experiences; Power relations; Social changes; Structural issues; Women in computing; Education computing","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1937759)","This research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation Grant #1937759.","Aretakis R., Hauck G., Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia: What We Know about the Video, Grand Jury and Arrests, (2020); Beck J., Forming a women's computer science support group, Proceedings of the 38th Sigcse Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (Covington, Kentucky, USA) (SIGCSE '07), pp. 400-404, (2007); Brown Q., On Being Black in Computing during These Days, (2020); Camp T., The incredible shrinking pipeline, Commun.

This analysis illuminates Morris-Cafiero's work of transgressive feminist art, using the body as a means for subverting the gaze of online misogyny and fat-shaming and presenting it anew. Morris-Cafiero uses self-portraiture to remark on the subject of online harassment as both the recipient and the sender. Bringing gendered histories of monstrosity into conversation with contemporary gendered online harassment, this article argues that the work of The Bully Pulpit exemplifies a new conception of polysemous monstrosity through which to understand the presentation of self, both for the artist and her trolls.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This is a crucial issue, which may harm minorities and underrepresented groups if such systems were integrated in real-world applications. In this paper, we create ad hoc tests through the CheckList tool (Ribeiro et al., 2020) to detect biases within abusive language classifiers for English. We compare the behaviour of two BERT-based models, one trained on a generic abusive language dataset and the other on a dataset for misogyny detection. Our evaluation shows that, although BERT-based classifiers achieve high accuracy levels on a variety of natural language processing tasks, they perform very poorly as regards fairness and bias, in particular on samples involving implicit stereotypes, expressions of hate towards minorities and protected attributes such as race or sexual orientation. We release both the notebooks implemented to extend the Fairness tests and the synthetic datasets usable to evaluate systems bias independently of CheckList.  © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; 'current; Accuracy level; Detection system; Fine grained; High-accuracy; Language detection; Minority groups; Real-world; Sensitive features; Under-represented groups; Natural language processing systems","","","","","","","Baccianella Stefano, Esuli Andrea, Sebastiani Fabrizio, SentiWordNet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'10), (2010); Basile Valerio, Bosco Cristina, Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Patti Viviana, Manuel Rangel Pardo Francisco, Rosso Paolo, Sanguinetti Manuela, SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63, (2019); Belinkov Yonatan, Bisk Yonatan, Synthetic and natural noise both break neural machine translation, (2018); Bender Emily M, Friedman Batya, Data statements for natural language processing: Toward mitigating system bias and enabling better science, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6, pp. 587-604, (2018); Bender Emily M., Gebru Timnit, McMillan- Major Angelina, Shmitchell Shmargaret, On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?, Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, FAccT '21, pp. 610-623, (2021); Blodgett Su Lin, Barocas Solon, Daume Hal, Wallach Hanna, Language (technology) is power: A critical survey of bias in nlp, (2020); Caselli Tommaso, Basile Valerio, Mitrovic Jelena, Kartoziya Inga, Granitzer Michael, I feel offended, don't be abusive! implicit/explicit messages in offensive and abusive language, Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 6193-6202, (2020); Corazza Michele, Menini Stefano, Cabrio Elena, Tonelli Sara, Villata Serena, A multilingual evaluation for online hate speech detection, ACM Trans.

The rise of the hip-hop culture over the last 50 years has turned into a powerful movement, empowering people from various communities and making their voices heard. However, certain parts of hip-hop and rap music have started being associated with misogyny, substance abuse and violent behavior. This study aims to find a correlation between lyrics of hip-hop and rap songs that glorify such illicit behavior through their lyrics and the actual rate of criminal activity of individuals that are directly or indirectly influenced by hip-hop culture. This research employs NLP concepts to build a model that detects song lyrics that falls into any of the 3 categories—“Misogyny,” “Substance Abuse” and “Violence.” A comparative study is conducted by training multiple models including multinomial naïve Bayes, random forest and LSTM on a manually collected and labeled dataset consisting of rap song lyrics released between 1970 and 2020. The highest performing model (LSTM—87% accuracy) was subsequently used to detect objectionable lyrics in popular rap songs of the decade of 2010–2019. To obtain a correlation of these with the criminal activity of the target population, official data of criminal activity (2010–2019) of citizens aged 0–29 from the largest hip-hop influenced areas in the world are compiled. This dataset is analyzed and to obtain strong evidence of a correlation between objectionable rap song lyrics being promoted through song lyrics and the criminal tendencies of the youth that is primarily affected by it. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Criminal; Hip-Hop; Juvenile crime; LSTM; Misogyny; NLP; Rap; Substance abuse; Violence","","","","","","","","Alridge J Stewart D.P., Introduction: Hip Hop in history: Past, present, and future, J.

Our focus of understanding is Indigenous studies and gender studies. Our aim is to show how modern education undermines these fields of studies. We use an autoethnographic method, reflecting more than 75 years as pupils/students and more than 90 years as educators. We have carefully chosen narratives of exposure to knowledge outside the educational system, as well as narratives of limitations posed upon us by the educational system. This narrative approach makes it possible for us to investigate and discuss our grief about areas of knowledge that society cries for, but the educational system continuously finds ways to resist. Our conclusion is that crucial knowledge is located outside the educational system, where individuals, groups, and communities cherish, protect, and guard knowledge that the educational system marginalises or excludes. As this knowledge is fundamental for life, our message is that the educational system needs to re-evaluate its strategies to stay relevant. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental shortcuts). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user's interaction history (i.e., which data points and attributes a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one's analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowd-sourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where things like gender bias or political party bias may drive one's analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Bias mitigation; Decision making; Human bias; Visual data analysis","Bias; Computer Graphics; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Male; Sexism; Behavioral research; Data visualization; Digital storage; Job analysis; Visualization; Analysis process; Bias mitigation; Decisions makings; Human bias; Interaction history; Scatter plots; Task analysis; User interaction; Visual data analysis; computer graphics; decision making; female; human; male; sexism; statistical bias; Decision making","","","","","Siemens FutureMaker; National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS-1813281); Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (1813281)","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation grant IIS-1813281 and the Siemens FutureMaker Fellowship","(2014); (2018); Aldrich J.H., Et al., Why parties?: The origin and transformation of political parties in America, University of Chicago Press, (1995); Bertrand M., Mullainathan S., Are emily and greg more employable than lakisha and jamal? a field experiment on labor market discrimination, American Economic Review, 94, 4, pp. 991-1013, (2004); Brown E.T., Ottley A., Zhao H., Lin Q., Souvenir R., Endert A., Chang R., Finding waldo: Learning about users from their interactions, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 20, 12, pp. 1663-1672, (2014); Ceneda D., Gschwandtner T., May T., Miksch S., Schulz H.-J., Streit M., Tominski C., Characterizing guidance in visual analytics, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23, 1, pp. 111-120, (2017); Cho I., Wesslen R., Karduni A., Santhanam S., Shaikh S., Dou W., The anchoring effect in decision-making with visual analytics, IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), (2017); Dimara E., Bailly G., Bezerianos A., Franconeri S., Mitigating the attraction effect with visualizations, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 25, 1, pp. 850-860, (2019); Dimara E., Bezerianos A., Dragicevic P., The attraction effect in information visualization, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23, 1, pp. 471-480, (2017); Dimara E., Franconeri S., Plaisant C., Bezerianos A., Dragicevic P., A task-based taxonomy of cognitive biases for information visualization, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, (2018); Dou W., Jeong D.H., Stukes F., Ribarsky W., Lipford H.R., Chang R., Recovering Reasoning Process from User Interactions, IEEE Computer Graphics & Applications, pp. 52-61, (2009); Dragicevic P., Fair Statistical Communication in Hci.

To help solve these problems, the study identified various predictors of online game sexism, which is hypothesised to predict actual in-game harassment. Different from previous studies, the study approaches the problems from the perspective of perpetrators rather than victims. We proposed a theoretical model that include three groups of predictors: offline sexist beliefs (masculine norms and hostile sexism), game-related factors (perceived territoriality, advancement, and competition), and environmental factors (peer harassment and play time). The model was tested against online survey data collected from a sample of 528 male gamers in South Korea with age range of 14–64 years (M = 34.70, SD = 12.81). The results showed that all the predictors, except competition and play time, were significantly associated with online game sexism, which mediated the relationships between the predictors and online sexual harassment. Perceived territoriality and peer harassment were found to have direct and positive effects on harassment. The findings are expected to contribute to developing more effective measures for preventing the hostility and aggression against female gamers by providing a new and more thorough diagnosis of the underlying causes of the problems. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Female gamers; in-game harassment; online game sexism; peer harassment; perceived territoriality","Information technology; Social sciences; Effective measures; Environmental factors; On-line games; Online surveys; Related factors; Sexual harassment; Theoretical modeling; Underlying cause; adolescent; article; competition; environmental factor; female; hostility; human; male; nonhuman; sexism; sexual harassment; South Korea; territoriality; wolf; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Adachi P.J., Willoughby T., The Effect of Video Game Competition and Violence on Aggressive Behavior: Which Characteristic has the Greatest Influence?, Psychology of Violence, 1, 4, pp. 259-274, (2011); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Ashcroft H., (2019); Ashley C., Noble S.M., It’s Closing Time: Territorial Behaviors from Customers in Response to Front Line Employees, Journal of Retailing, 90, 1, pp. 74-92, (2014); Bandura A., Psychological Modelling: Conflicting Theories, (1971); Bandura A., Social Learning Theory, (1977); Begany J.J., Milburn M.A., Psychological Predictors of Sexual Harassment: Authoritarianism, Hostile Sexism, and Rape Myths, Psychology of Men & Masculinity, 3, 2, pp. 119-126, (2002); Behm-Morawitz E., Schipper S., Sexing the Avatar: Gender, Sexualization, and Cyber-Harassment in a Virtual World, Journal of Media Psychology, 28, pp. 161-174, (2015); Bossler A.M., Holt T.J., May D.C., Predicting Online Harassment Victimization among a Juvenile Population, Youth & Society, 44, 4, pp. 500-523, (2012); Brehm A.L., Navigating the Feminine in Massively Multiplayer Online Games: Gender in World of Warcraft, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, pp. 1-12, (2013); Brown G., Lawrence T.B., Robinson S.L., Territoriality in Organizations, Academy of Management Review, 30, 3, pp. 577-594, (2005); Brown G., Zhu H., ‘My Workspace, not Yours’: The Impact of Psychological Ownership and Territoriality in Organizations, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 48, pp. 54-64, (2016); Butler J., Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, (1999); Byrne B.M., Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS: Basic Concepts, Applications, and Programming, (2010); Campbell C., (2018); Chen V.H.H., Duh H.B.K., Ng C.W., (2009); Chess S., Shaw A., A Conspiracy of Fishes, or, how we Learned to Stop Worrying About# GamerGate and Embrace Hegemonic Masculinity, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 59, 1, pp. 208-220, (2015); Choi J., Kim S., Is the Smartwatch an IT Product or a Fashion Product?

Today, machine learning techniques play an important role in detecting inappropriate content and help moderate online interaction. Text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods has been extensively studied using deep learning models and transformers which have shown impressive results. Despite this, specific classification tasks on limited datasets still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose an approach based on an Attention-Based Bidirectional LSTM model and a combination of custom features to enhance automatic misogyny identification (AMI) on social media. We present a multi-lingual study of the phenomena by carrying out different classification experiments. Our study focuses on selecting most important features to improve the model for misogyny detection. The proposed model outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Classification tasks; Learning models; Machine learning techniques; Online gaming site; Online interaction; Online moderation; Processing method; Social media; Social media platforms; Text classification; Long short-term memory","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-06233); Mitacs","*This work was enabled in part by support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2018-06233, and the Mitacs Accelerate program.

As sexist content towards women is increasingly spread on social networks, the automatic detection and categorization of these tweets/posts can help social scientists and policymakers in research, thereby combating sexism. In this paper, we explore the problem of detecting whether a Twitter/Gab post is sexist or not.We further discriminate the detected sexist post into one of the fine-grained sexism categories. We propose a neural model for this sexism detection and classification that can combine representations obtained using RoBERTa model and linguistic features such as Empath, Hurtlex, and Perspective API by involving recurrent components.We also leverage the unlabeled sexism data to infuse the domain-specific transformer model into our framework. Our proposed framework also features a knowledge module comprised of emoticon and hashtag representations to infuse the external knowledge-specific features into the learning process. Several proposed methods outperform various baselines across several standard metrics. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Keeping in mind research that has indicated that adolescents imbibe social behavior from movies, we propose a hybrid deep learning model to detect the degree of prejudice (sexism, racism, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia etc) in movies. Using a stacked bi-LSTM and XGBoost model to make predictions, we compared the percentage of prejudice in movies from two time periods (1975-2000 and 2001-2020). Further, we compared animated movies from production houses like Disney, Pixar with movies often rated R or PG-18 by Motion Picture Content Rating Boards. The results showed that the percentage of prejudice has been significantly reduced in the newer decades, and that, surprisingly, movies intended for a younger target audience, on average, perpetuate more prejudice than those meant for late teenagers and adults.  © 2022 IEEE.","Gradient Boosting; Long Short Term Memory; Sentiment Analysis; Text Analysis","Motion pictures; Sentiment analysis; Content ratings; Gradient boosting; Learning models; Production house; Sentiment analysis; Social behaviour; Target audience; Text analysis; Time-periods; Long short-term memory","","","","","","","Ciranka S., Van Den Bos W., Social influence in adolescent decision-making: A formal framework, Frontiers in Psychology, 10, (2019); Valkenburg P., Piotrowski J., Pluggedin: How media attract and affect youth, (2017); Kubrak T., Impact of films: Changes in young people's attitudes after watching a movie, Behav Sci (Basel), 10, 5, (2020); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-term memory, Neural computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); American Psychological Association Dictionary of Psychology; Singh S., Anand T., Ghosh Chowdhury A., Waseem Z., hold on honey, men at work: A semi-supervised approach to detecting sex-ism in sitcoms, Proceedings of the 59th AnnualMeeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: Student Research Workshop, pp. 180-185, (2021); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people?

In the digital era, misogynists have found in social networks a place in which they can spread their oppressive discourse towards women. Although this particular form of oppressive speech is banned and punished on most social networks, its identification is quite challenging due to the large number of messages posted everyday. Moreover, sexist comments can be unnoticed as condescends or friendly statements which hinders its identification even for humans. With the aim of improving automatic sexist identifi- cation on social networks, we participate in EXIST-2021. This shared task involves the identification and categorisation of sexism language on Spanish and English documents compiled from micro-blogging platforms. Specifically, two tasks were proposed, one concerning a binary classification of sexism utterances and another regarding multi-class identification of sexist traits. Our proposal for solving both tasks is grounded on the combination of linguistic features and state-of-the-art transformers by means of ensembles and multi-input neural networks. To address the multi-language problem, we tackle the problem independently by language to put the results together at the end. Our best result was achieved in task 1 with an accuracy of 75.14% and 61.70% for task 2. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Prior works have shown the role of homophily in information diffusion, sustenance of online guilds and contagion in product adoption. We observe that familiarity computation techniques used in the literature such as the presence of an edge, and the number of mutual friends between a pair of users, have ample scope of improvement. We address the limitations of existing familiarity computation methods by employing a variational-graph-auto-encoder to capture a user’s position in the network and utilizing this representation to compute familiarity. We empirically demonstrate the presence of homophily on a dataset from Twitter. Further, we investigate how homophily varies with different hateful forms, such as hate manifesting in topics of gender, race, colour etc. Our results indicate higher homophily in users associating with topics of racism, sexism and nationalism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hate speech; Homophily; Social networks","","","","","","","","Afrasiabi Rad A., Benyoucef M., Similarity and ties in social networks a study of the YouTube social network, J.

Centre-ville, Montréal, H3C3P8, QC, Canada","Work activity ergonomics (sometimes called francophone ergonomics) draws heavily on observation in order to support transformation of work to arrive at better health without interfering with productivity. Recently, ergonomists have attempted to integrate gender into their interventions. At the same time, ergonomists have been observing and documenting the importance of considering collective dimensions of work, thus including the construction of social relations among workers. Gender as well as biological sex can affect work activity through (1) Gendered job and task assignments; (2) Biological differences between women and men influencing the interface between work activity and the physical environment; (3) Gendered human relations at work, including sexual stereotyping, sexism, sexual harrassment, and sexual relations among workers and between workers and management or clients; (4) Manifestations of work-family articulation. But actually observing these phenomena poses various difficulties for the ergonomist. How can/should gender be observed by ergonomists? We describe a set of twenty studies, undertaken by ergonomists in collaboration with trade union women’s committees and health and safety committees, where observations were central. We describe in particular detail a study of work-family articulation. Participant and ergonomic observations of workers with highly invasive schedules assigned to cleaning transportation equipment, and relational analysis tools were mobilized to reveal determinants of work activity and some sources of social inequalities. Integrating observations of gender and other dimensions of social relations into ergonomic analysis and intervention is revealed as necessary, but not simple, and fraught with obstacles. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Ergonomic analysis; Gender; Sex differences; Unions; Work-family articulation","Human resource management; Industrial relations; Ergonomic analysis; Gender; Health and safety committees; Physical environments; Sex difference; Social inequalities; Transportation equipments; Unions; Ergonomics","","","","","Université du Québec à Montréal Service aux collectivités; Fonds de Recherche du Québec-Société et Culture, FRQSC; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, IRSC; Institute of Gender and Health, IGH; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The authors are grateful for valuable input from Quebec workers and their organizations.

Drawing on feminist approaches and technological affordances, we examine how heterosexual cisgender women and men experience this “empowerment” and contrast it to other mobile dating app use. We used a multimethod approach to conducting app walkthroughs, focus groups, and interviews to contrast the mobile dating apps, Tinder and Bumble. The findings reveal that perceptions of free choice and action determine empowerment experiences. Our study reveals that the “forced empowerment” on Bumble was still strongly shaped by heterosexual gender norms that encouraged “good” girls and guys to use the app to look for long-term relationships but continue to use Tinder to hook up, despite the popular misogyny on Tinder identified by both men and women in our study. We conclude by discussing the empowerment paradox of dating apps through popular feminism and misogyny. © The Author(s) 2021.","female empowerment; heterosexual gender norms; mobile dating apps; paradox of mobile dating; technological affordances","","","","","","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partly supported by a postdoc fellowship of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

They are usually involved in misogyny and hateful conversations on social networks, leading to several terrorist attacks in recent years, also known as incel rebellion. In order to stop terrorist acts like this, the first step is to detect incels members in social networks. To this end, user-generated data can give us insights. In previous attempts to identifying incels in social media, users' likes and fuzzy likes data were considered. However, another piece of information that can be helpful to identify such social network members is users' comments. In this study, for the first time, we have considered users' comments to identify incels in the social networks. Accordingly, an algorithm using sentiment analysis was proposed. Study results show that by implementing the proposed method on social media users' comments, incel members can be identified in social networks with an accuracy of 78.8%, which outperforms the previous work in this field by 10.05%. © 2021 IEEE.","Detection Method; Incels; Sentiment Analysis; Social Media Comments; Social Networks","Sentiment analysis; Terrorism; On-line communities; Social media; Terrorist acts; Terrorist attacks; User-generated; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Frenda S., Bilal G., Exploration of misogyny in Spanish and english tweets, Third Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages (IberEval 2018) (Vol, 2150, pp. 260-267, (2018); Al-Hassan A., Al-Dossari H., Detection of hate speech in social networks: Asurvey on multilingual corpus, Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT), 9, 2, (2019); Hajarian M., Bastanfard A., Mohammadzadeh J., Khalilian M., SNEFL: Social network explicit fuzzy like dataset and its application for Incel detection, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 78, 23, pp. 33457-33486, (2019); Onorati T., Diaz P., Carrion B., From social networks to emergency operation centers: A semantic visualization approach, Future Generation Computer Systems, 95, pp. 829-840, (2019); Diaz P., Aedo I., Herranz S., Citizen participation and social technologies: Exploring the perspective of emergency organizations, International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management in Mediterranean Countries, pp. 85-97, (2014); Herranz S., Diaz P., Diez D., Aedo I., Studying social technologies and communities of volunteers in emergency management, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Communities and Technologies, pp. 140-148, (2013); Romano M., Diaz P., Aedo I., Emergency management and smart cities: Civic engagement through gamification, International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management in Mediterranean Countries, pp. 3-14, (2016); Onorati T., Diaz P., Recio B.C., Tweet me and I'll help you: Mapping tweets for emergency operation centers: The case of Paris attacks, 2016 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS), pp. 31-34, (2016); Pittman M., Reich B., Social media and loneliness: Why an Instagram picture may be worth more than a thousand Twitter words, Computers in Human Behavior, 62, pp. 155-167, (2016); Lin S., Liu D., Niu G., Longobardi C., Active social network sites use and loneliness: The mediating role of social support and self-esteem, Current Psychology, pp. 1-8, (2020); Jaspal R., Breakwell G.M., Socio-economic inequalities in social network, loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 0020764020976694, (2020); Hajek A., Konig H.H., Social isolation and loneliness of older adults in times of the CoViD-19 pandemic: Can use of online social media sites and video chats assist in mitigating social isolation and loneliness, Gerontology, 67, 1, pp. 121-124, (2021); Kittirojrattana C., Shibamoto E., Koopipat C., Hansuebsai A., Prediction of user's special feelings, Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases XXXI, 321, (2020); Sailunaz K., Alhajj R., Emotion and sentiment analysis from Twitter text, Journal of Computational Science, 36, (2019); Sailunaz K., Dhaliwal M., Rokne J., Alhajj R., Emotion detection from text and speech: A survey, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 8, 1, pp. 1-26, (2018); Guo C., Cao J., Zhang X., Shu K., Liu H., Dean: Learning Dual Emotion for Fake News Detection on Social Media, (2019); Chathumali E.J.A.P.C., Thelijjagoda S., Detecting human emotions on Facebook comments, 2020 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE), pp. 124-128, (2020); Hajarian M., Camilleri M.A., Diaz P., Aedo I., A taxonomy of online marketing methods, Strategic Corporate Communication in the Digital Age.

By going back to pre-2000 online anime histories, this paper proposes to understand how women-exclusionary discursive practices on rec.arts.anime have contributed to shaping contemporary toxic technocultures’ discursive identities, as it is admitted that forum 4chan originated from online anime fandom. By using a data set of 252 messages related to gender issues posted from 1992 to 1996, I identify 7 discursive practices that I am theorizing here under the name of negative networking: 1. Blaming female anime fans for their lack of visibility; 2. Doubting the authentic interest of women in anime; 3. Mystifying the female anime fan; 4. Harassing female anime fans; 5. Criticizing the association of feminism with anime, both as interpretive practices and as scholarship; 6. Belittling female anime fans’ concerns; and 7. Denying or ignoring the challenges faced by female anime fans. I argue that the impact of these discourses must be understood as determinant in the establishment of the online anime hegemonic fan identity and its prediscourses, especially as they relate to the long-lasting marginalization of women and gender diverse anime fans. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anime; fandom; forum; memes; misogyny; Usenet","","","","","","","","Amin S., (2020); Baym N.K., Tune in, log on: Soaps, fandom, and online community, (2000); Beran D., It came from something awful: How a toxic troll army accidentally memed Donald Trump into office, (2019); Beschizza R., (2015); Broderick R., (2017); Charity J., (2016); Crossen-White H.L., Using digital archives in historical research: What are the ethical concerns for a ‘forgotten’ individual?, Research Ethics, 11, 2, pp. 108-119, (2015); Daliot-Bul M., Otmazgin N., The anime boom in the United States: Lessons for global creative industries, (2020); D'Anastasio C., Girls fight with their butts and boobs in this wretched new anime, (2016); Eng L., Strategies of engagement: Discovering, defining, and describing Otaku culture in the United States, Fandom unbound: Otaku culture in a connected world, (2012); Ernest Dit Alban E., Imagining diversity: Mapping the potential and limits of a “Queer” Otaku theory, Mechademia Second Arc, 14, 2, pp. 116-133, (2022); Fan R., February 10), The Politics behind ‘attack on titan.’ Medium, (2021); Fujioka B.J., DeCook J.R., Digital cynical romanticism: Japan’s 2channel and the precursors to online extremist cultures, Internet Histories, 5, 3-4, pp. 287-303, (2021); Hargittai E., Handbook of digital inequality, (2021); Hauben M., Hauben R., Netizens: On the history and impact of usenet and the internet, (1997); Hauben R., Commodifying usenet and the usenet archive or continuing the online cooperative usenet culture?, Science & Technology Studies, 15, 1, pp. 61-68, (2002); Hemmann K., Manga cultures and the female gaze, (2020); Jenkins H., Ford S., Green J., Spreadable media: Creating value and meaning in a networked culture, (2013); Kendall L., Hanging out in the virtual pub: Masculinities and relationships online, (2002); Keidl P., Waysdorf A., Fandom histories, Transformative Works and Cultures, 37, (2022); Ledoux T., Ranney D., (1997); Lees M., (2016); Light J.S., When computers were women, Technology and Culture, 40, 3, pp. 455-483, (1999); Mackey J., (2021); Maiberg E., (2017); Massanari A.L., Participatory culture, community, and play: Learning from Reddit, (2014); McKevitt A.C., Consuming Japan: Popular culture and the globalizing of 1980s America, (2017); Nakamura L., Digitizing race: Visual cultures of the internet, (2008); Neiwert D., Alt-America: The rise of the radical right in the age of trump, (2017); Newitz A., Anime Otaku: Japanese animation fans outside Japan, Bad Subjects, 1, 13, pp. 13-20, (1994); Noble S.U., Algorithms of oppression: How search engines reinforce racism, (2018); Patten F., Watching anime, reading manga: 25 years of essays and reviews, (2004); Paveau M.-A., Les prédiscours: Sens, mémoire, cognition, (2006); Phillips W., This is why we can’t have nice things: Mapping the relationship between online trolling and mainstream culture, (2015); Phillips W., Milner R.M., The ambivalent internet: Mischief, oddity, and antagonism online, (2018); Poulsen K., (2009); Rankin J.L., A people’s history of computing in the United States, (2018); Read M., (2015); Schodt F.L., Dreamland Japan: Writings on modern manga, (2014); Scott S., Fake geek girls: Fandom, gender, and the convergence culture industry, (2019); Shifman L., Memes in digital culture, (2013); Stanfill M., The unbearable whiteness of fandom and fan studies, A companion to media fandom and fan studies, pp. 305-317, (2018); Steinberg M., Converging contents and platforms: Niconico video and Japan’s media mix ecology, Asian video cultures: In the penumbra of the global, pp. 91-113, (2017); Steinberg M., The platform economy: How Japan transformed the consumer internet, (2019); (2020); Suomela T., Chee F., Berendt B., Rockwell G., Applying an ethics of care to internet research: Gamergate and digital humanities, Digital Studies/Le Champ Numérique, 9, 1, pp. 1-28, (2019); van Dijk J., The digital divide, (2020); Wagener A., Creating identity and building bridges between cultures: The case of 9gag, International Journal of Communication, 8, 8, pp. 2488-2502, (2014); Wakeford N., Networking women and Grrrls with information/communication technology: Surfing tales of the world wide web, Processed lives: Gender and technology in everyday life, pp. 51-66, (1997); Wescott A., (2020)","A.

Given the increasing number of experiences of sexism shared online, categorizing these recollections automatically can support the battle against sexism, since it can promote successful evaluations by gender studies researchers and government representatives engaged in policy making. In this paper, we examine the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism. We devise self-training-based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. In addition to data augmentation methods, we develop a neural model which combines biLSTM and attention with a domain-adapted BERT model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Further, we formulate a multi-level training approach in which models are sequentially trained using categories of sexism of different levels of granularity. Moreover, we devise a loss function that exploits any label confidence scores associated with the data. Several proposed methods outperform various baselines on a recently released dataset for multi-label sexism categorization across several standard metrics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Fine-grained categorization; Multi-label classification; Multi-level; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification","Supervised learning; Fine grained; Fine-grained categorization; Gender studies; Multi-label classifications; Multi-labels; Multilevels; Policy making; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Abburi H., Parikh P., Chhaya N., Varma V., Semi-supervised multi-task learning for multi-label fine-grained sexism classification, Proceedings of the 28Th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, International Committee on Computational Linguistics, pp. 5810-5820, (2020); Abney S., Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics, (2007); Agrawal S., Awekar A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms, European Conference on Information Retrieval, pp. 141-153, (2018); Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Us and them: identifying cyber hate on twitter across multiple protected characteristics, EPJ Data Sci, 5, 1, (2016); Cer D., Yang Y., Syhua N., Limtiaco N., John R.S., Constant N., Guajardo-Cespedes M., Yuan S., Tar C., Et al., Universal sentence encoder, (2018); Chiril P., Moriceau V., Benamara F., Mari A., Origgi G., Coulomb-Gully M., An annotated corpus for sexism detection in french tweets, Proceedings of the 12Th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 1397-1403, (2020); Chiril P., Moriceau V., Benamara F., Mari A., Origgi G., Coulomb-Gully M., He said “who’s gonna take care of your children when you are at acl?’: Reported sexist acts are not sexist, Proceedings of the 58Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 4055-4066, (2020); Chowdhury A.G., Sawhney R., Shah R., Mahata D., # youtoo?

From large corporations to small universities, leaders recognize the importance of those with more experience guiding junior employees and students. Colleges and universities have taken the lead nationwide in mentoring efforts, with many having exemplary peer mentoring programs for undergraduates, and some institutions deploying mentoring to support faculty and students. The discipline of Communication has also begun to place more emphasis on mentoring. Yet, some populations, specifically women of color and other minoritized people, do not always have access to networks or programs and are left on their own to navigate institutions and processes. That few women of color faculty inhabit academic spaces in Communication departments, as in other departments across campuses, creates additional challenges for students and faculty, who often lack mentors and yet carry the additional burden of mentoring. This introduction to the special forum in CCC brings sets up the critical insights on mentoring our senior and emerging contributors offer.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Benevolent sexism was positively correlated with these gender stereotypes. The analyses of variance indicated that benevolent sexism influenced the stereotypical statements about boys' and girls' abilities in the different subject areas, when gender and the specialty was chosen (STEM or non-STEM). The higher the level of benevolent sexism among pre-service teachers, the higher their endorsement of gender stereotypes about students' abilities. The present research contributes to the study of the relationship between gender stereotypes about girls' and boys' abilities and ambivalent sexist attitudes among a group of pre-service primary and secondary teachers.  © 2021 IEEE.","academic sexism; ambivalent sexism; gender stereotypes; pre-service teachers","Academic ability; Academic sexism; Ambivalent sexism; Analyse of variances; Gender stereotypes; Preservice teachers; Teachers'; Students","","","","","","","Almutawa F.A., Beliefs of Pre-service Teachers at the University of Pittsburgh about Gender Roles and the Role of Teachers in Relation to Gender Differences, (2005); Cubillas Rodriguez M., Abril Valdez E., Dominguez Ibanez S., Roman Perez R., Hernandez Montano A., Zapata Salazar J., Creencias sobre estereotipos de género de jóvenes universitarios del norte de México, Revista Perspectivas Psicológicas, 12, 2, pp. 217-230, (2016); Eagly A.H., Steffen V.J., Gender stereotypes stem from the distribution of women and men into social roles, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46, pp. 735-754, (1984); Eccles J.S., Bringing young women to math and science, Gender and Thought, pp. 36-58, (1989); Eccles J.S., Adler T.F., Futterman R., Goff S.B., Kaczala C.M., Meece J.L., Et al., Expectancies, values and academic behaviours, Achievement and Achievement Motives.

Recent studies involving gonadectomy and sex hormone replacement experiments in mice have shed some light onto the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism in the adrenal cortex. Indeed, it has been shown that gonadal hormones influence many aspects of adrenal physiology, ranging from stem cell-dependent tissue turnover to steroidogenesis and X-zone dynamics. This article reviews current knowledge on adrenal cortex sexual dimorphism and the potential mechanisms underlying sex hormone influence of adrenal homeostasis. Both topics are expected to contribute to personalized and novel therapeutic approaches in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Without honest conversations about power relations within the field of Computing, one cannot expect to engender social change that equates to equity for all CS students. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework, we interview 18 Black women about their experiences navigating the computing education ecosystem. Intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three saturated sites of violence within CS education: 1. traditional K-12 classrooms; 2. predominantly White institutions; and 3. internships as supplementary learning experiences. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo. Specifically, we collect the tweets mentioned above and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral. In this context, we address the problem as a multiclass classification problem by using the pre-trained language models ULMFiT and AWD-LSTM, which achieved a Fmicro of 0.85. Finally, we use the classified dataset to conduct a case study in which we capture the sentiment orientation during the network evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; NLP; Online Social Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; ULMFiT","E-learning; Long short-term memory; Polarization; Sentiment analysis; Case-studies; Classifieds; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Hashtags; Hate speech; Language model; Multiclass classification problems; Sentiment analysis; ULMFiT; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Bollen J., Pepe A., Mao H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena, CORR, (2009); Belkin L., Kurtzberg T., Naquin C., Emotional contagion in the online environment: Investigating the dynamics and implications of emotional encounters in mixed-motive situations in the electronic context, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2006); Hillmann R., Trier M., Sentiment polarization and balance among users in online social networks, AMCIS, 24, (2012); Seo K., Pan R., Panasyuk A., Detecting communities by sentiment analysis of controversial topics, SBP-BRiMS, 9708, pp. 206-215, (2016); Collobert R., Weston J., Bottou L., Karlen M., Kavukcuoglu K., Kuksa P., Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch, (2011); Frenda S., Ghanem B., Montes M., Rosso P., Online hate speech against women: Automatic identification of misogyny and sexism on twitter, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 36, pp. 4743-4752, (2019); Sharma S., Agrawal S., Shrivastava M., Degree based classification of harmful speech using twitter data, TRAC, pp. 106-112, (2018); Mathew B., Dutt R., Goyal P., Mukherjee A., Spread of Hate Speech in Online Social Media, (2018); Wulczyn E., Thain N., Dixon L., Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale, (2016); Tsantarliotis P., Pitoura E., Tsaparas P., Troll vulnerability in online social networks, ASONAM, pp. 1394-1396, (2016); Fornacciari P., Mordonini M., Tomaiuolo M., Social Network and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: Towards A Combined Approach, pp. 53-64, (2015); Xu Z., Yang Q., Analyzing user retweet behavior on twitter, ASONAM, pp. 46-50, (2012); Jiang L., Yu M., Zhou M., Liu X., Zhao T., Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification, pp. 151-160, (2011); Speriosu M., Sudan N., Upadhyay S., Baldridge J., Twitter Polarity Classification with Label Propagation over Lexical Links and the Follower Graph, pp. 53-63, (2011); Founta A.M., Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Vakali A., Leontiadis I., A unified deep learning architecture for abuse detection, WebSci, pp. 105-114, (2019); Cao R., Lee R.K.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, Ser.

Transformer-based Natural Language Processing models have become the standard for hate speech detection. However, the unconscious use of these techniques for such a critical task comes with negative consequences. Various works have demonstrated that hate speech classifiers are biased. These findings have prompted efforts to explain classifiers, mainly using attribution methods. In this paper, we provide the first benchmark study of interpretability approaches for hate speech detection. We cover four post-hoc token attribution approaches to explain the predictions of Transformer-based misogyny classifiers in English and Italian. Further, we compare generated attributions to attention analysis. We find that only two algorithms provide faithful explanations aligned with human expectations. Gradient-based methods and attention, however, show inconsistent outputs, making their value for explanations questionable for hate speech detection tasks. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Benchmark study; Critical tasks; Detection tasks; Gradient-based method; Interpretability; Language processing; Natural languages; Processing model; Speech detection; Speech recognition","","","","","MONICA; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Politecnico di Torino, POLITO; European Research Council, ERC; Fondazione Cariplo, (2020-4288); Horizon 2020, (949944)","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and area chairs for their suggestion to strengthen the paper.

Applications regarding a state-of-the-art workplace sexism detection model include aids for Human Resources departments, AI chatbots and sentiment analysis. Most existing hate speech detection methods, although robust and accurate, focus on hate speech found on social media, specifically Twitter. The context of social media is much more anonymous than the workplace, therefore it tends to lend itself to more aggressive and “hostile” versions of sexism. Therefore, datasets with large amounts of “hostile” sexism have a slightly easier detection task since “hostile” sexist statements can hinge on a couple words that, regardless of context, tip the model off that a statement is sexist. In this paper we present a dataset of sexist statements that are more likely to be said in the workplace as well as a deep learning model that can achieve state-of-the art results. Previous research has created state-of-the-art models to distinguish “hostile” and “benevolent” sexism based simply on aggregated Twitter data. Our deep learning methods, initialized with GloVe or random word embeddings, use LSTMs with attention mechanisms to outperform those models on a more diverse, filtered dataset that is more targeted towards workplace sexism, leading to an F1 score of 0.88. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Attention mechanism; Hate speech; LSTM; Natural Language Processing; Sexism; Workplace","Biomimetics; Deep learning; Large dataset; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Attention mechanisms; Automatic Detection; Classification tasks; Detection models; Detection tasks; Learning methods; Speech detection; State of the art; Data mining","","","","","ISEP; Stanford University, SU","Supported by Stanford University and ISEP.","Aarons E., Ada Hegerberg: First Women’s Ballon d’Or Marred as Winner is Asked to Twerk. the Guardian, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, International Conference on Learning Representations, (2015); Bolukbasi T., Et al., Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?

The “Ni putes ni soumises” movement, born from the publication of a manifesto in March 2003, is described by Guénif-Souilamas as “consensual, antifeminist, heterocentric, and reactionary” and will draw different central figures - that of the “beurette” victim and the Arab boy executioner.

We design an experiment, set the gender and productivity of an actor or actress in a certain period as the independent variables, and introduce deep learning techniques to do the prediction of success, extract the latent features, and understand the data we use. Three models have been trained: the first one is trained by the data of an actor, the second one is trained by the data of an actress, and the third one is trained by the mixed data. Three benchmark models are constructed with the same conditions. The experiment results show that our models are more general and accurate than benchmarks. An interesting finding is that the models trained by the data of an actor/actress only achieve similar performance on the data of another gender without performance loss. It shows that the gender bias is weakly related to success. Through the visualization of the feature maps in the embedding space, we see that prediction models have learned some common laws although they are trained by different data. Using the above findings, a more general and accurate model to predict the success in show business can be built. © 2020 Chong Wu et al.","","Female; Humans; Male; Sexism; Data visualization; Deep learning; Forecasting; Accurate modeling; Benchmark models; Feature map; Independent variables; Learning techniques; Performance loss; Prediction model; Three models; female; human; male; sexism; Predictive analytics","","","","","","","Williams O.E., Lacasa L., Latora V., Quantifying and predicting success in show business, Nature Communications, 10, 1, pp. 1-8, (2019); Petersen A.M., Jung W.-S., Yang J.-S., Stanley H.E., Quantitative and empirical demonstration of the matthew effect in a study of career longevity, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108, 1, pp. 18-23, (2011); Janosov M., Battiston F., Sinatra R., Success and luck in creative careers, EPJ Data Science, 9, 1, (2020); Easley D., Kleinberg J., Networks, crowds, and markets: reasoning about a highly connected world, Significance, 9, pp. 43-44, (2012); Barabasi A.-L., The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success, (2018); Fraiberger S.P., Sinatra R., Resch M., Riedl C., Barabasi A.-L., Quantifying reputation and success in art, Science, 362, 6416, pp. 825-829, (2018); Juhasz S., Toth G.O., Lengyel B., Brokering the core and the periphery: creative success and collaboration networks in the film industry, PLoS One, 15, 2, (2020); Wu L., Wang D., Evans J.A., Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology, Nature, 566, 7744, pp. 378-382, (2019); Moreno B., Ciotti V., Panzarasa P., Liverani S., Lacasa L., Latora V., Predicting success in the worldwide start-up network, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, pp. 1-6, (2020); Sinatra R., Wang D., Deville P., Song C., Barabasi A.-L., Quantifying the evolution of individual scientific impactfic impact, Science, 354, 6312, (2016); Hirsch J.E., An index to quantify an individual's scientific research output, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 102, 46, pp. 16569-16572, (2005); Kozbelt A., One-hit wonders in classical music: evidence and (partial) explanations for an early career peak, Creativity Research Journal, 20, 2, pp. 179-195, (2008); Simonton D.K., Creative productivity: a predictive and explanatory model of career trajectories and landmarks, Psychological Review, 104, 1, pp. 66-89, (1997); Lehman H.C., Age and Achievement, (2017); Simonton D.K., Age and outstanding achievement: what do we know after a century of research?, Psychological Bulletin, 104, 2, pp. 251-267, (1988); Spitz A., Horvat E.-A., Measuring long-term impact based on network centrality: unraveling cinematic citations, PLoS One, 9, 10, (2014); Acuna D.E., Allesina S., Kording K.P., Predicting scientific success, Nature, 489, 7415, pp. 201-202, (2012); Penner O., Pan R.K., Petersen A.M., Kaski K., Fortunato S., On the predictability of future impact in science, Scientific Reports, 3, 1, pp. 1-8, (2013); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-term memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Voelker A., Kajic I., Eliasmith C., Legendre memory units: continuous-time representation in recurrent neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 15544-15553, (2019); Graves A., Mohamed A.-R., Hinton G., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks, pp. 6645-6649; Huang J., Zhou W., Zhang Q., Li H., Li W., Video-based sign language recognition without temporal segmentation; Wang L., Duan X., Zhang Q., Niu Z., Hua G., Zheng N., Segment-tube: spatio-temporal action localization in untrimmed videos with per-frame segmentation, Sensors, 18, 5, (2018); Duan X., Wang L., Zhai C., Joint spatiotemporal action localization in untrimmed videos with per-frame segmentation, pp. 918-922; Orsini F., Gastaldi M., Mantecchini L., Rossi R., Neural networks trained with WiFi traces to predict airport passenger behavior, pp. 1-7","","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","16875265","","","32695154","English","Comput.

This study shows how knowledge acquisition under artificial intelligence can be used to detect stereotypes and objectification of women in video games. Until now, there is no intelligent system that acquires knowledge and gives feedback to users and video game designers. This is a research based on secondary data. The existing literature review covers the effects of video games on aggression, hostility and obesity. It also shows how video games disrupts the self-concept of young girls and adult women, stereotypes between men and women, that is sexism, how perceptions of people are affectedand the social issues that come with. A conceptual framework on the same is proposed based on 3 main stereotypical concepts that were derived from the existing literature: sexism, scantily-clad women and vision of beauty. The conceptual framework shows how AI can help control the situation, warn parents and help video game designers to make clean and better games. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Intelligent system; Knowledge acquisition; Objectification of women and video games","Artificial intelligence; Intelligent systems; Interactive computer graphics; Knowledge acquisition; Software design; Conceptual frameworks; Literature reviews; Secondary datum; Social issues; Video game; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","English Oxford Living Dictionaries, Definition of Objectification in English; Good Therapy, Objectification, (2015); PBS News Hour, Study Tracks 31-year History of Female Sexualization in Video Games, (2016); The Statistics Portal, Age Breakdown of Video Game Players in the United States in 2018; Triberti S., Milani L., Villani D., Grumi S., Peracchia S., Cursio G., Riva G., What matters is when you play: Investigating the relationship between online video games addiction and time spent playing over specific day phases, Addictive Behaviors Report, 8, pp. 185-188, (2018); Scharrer E., Kamau G., Warren S., Zhang C., Violent video games do contribute to aggression, Video Game Influences on Aggression, Cognition and Attention, pp. 5-29, (2018); TopSCHOLAR, the Effects of Violence in Video Games on Individual Levels of Hostility in Young Adults, (2018); Bushman B., Guns automatically prime aggressive thoughts, regardless of whether a ""good guy"" or"" bad guy, Holds the Gun, Social Psychological and Personality Science, 9, 6, (2017); Messias E., Castro J., Saini A., Usman M., Peeples D., Sadness, Suicide, and Their Association with Video Game and Internet Overuse among Teens: Results from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2007 and 2009, Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 41, 3, pp. 307-315, (2011); Vandewater E., Shim M., Caplovitz A., Linking obesity and activity level with children's television and video game use, Journal of Adolescence, 27, 1, pp. 71-85, (2004); Anderson C., Bushman B., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature, Psychological Science, 12, 5, (2001); Gestos M., Smith-Merry J., Campbell A., Representation of women in video games, a systematic review of literature in consideration of adult female wellbeing, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 21, 9, (2018); Lim; Gender Roles in Video Games: The Importance of Characterization and Its Impact on Society, (2014); Fox J., Ralston R., Cooper C., Jones K., Sexualized avatars lead to women's self-objectification and acceptance of rape myths, Psychology of Women Quarterly, 39, 3, (2014); Behm-Morawitz E., Mastro D., The effects of the sexualization of female video game characters on gender stereotyping and female self-concept, Sex Roles, 61, 11-12, pp. 808-823, (2009); Ogletree S., Drake R., College students' video game participation and perceptions: Gender differences and implications, Sex Roles, 56, 7-8, pp. 537-542, (2007); Cox A., Women by women: A gender analysis of sierra titles by women designers, Feminism in Play, pp. 21-35, (2018); Mikkola M., Pornographic Videogames, the Aesthetic of Videogames, (2018); Fox J., Bailenson J., Tricase L., The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experiences of self-objectification via avatars, Computers in Human Behaviour, 29, 3, pp. 930-938, (2013); Beck V., Boys S., Rose C., Beck E., Violence against women in video games, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 27, 15, (2012); Jansz J., Martis R., The lara phenomenon: Powerful female characters in video games, Sex Roles, 57, 3-4, pp. 141-148, (2007); GN, Are Porn and Games Basically the Same Thing, (2012); DZone, What AI Can Teach Us about Stereotypes, (2018); Medium, Do Algorithms Reveal Sexual Orientation or Just Expose Our Stereotypes; The Sun, CHILLING CHALLENGE What Is the Blue Whale Suicide Game, How Many Deaths Are Linked to the Challenge and Is It in the UK, (2018); Advantages and Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Lu H., Li Y., Chen M., Kim H., Serikawa S., Brain intelligence: Go beyond artificial intelligence, Mobile Networks and Applications, 23, 2, pp. 368-375, (2017); Artificial Intelligence for Economic Development, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 Amity International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AICAI 2019","4 February 2019 through 6 February 2019","Dubai","147667","","978-153869346-9","","","English","Proc. - Amity Int.

According to the research, the objective was to analyze the predictive relationship of the Disney Princess films in the way of thinking regarding the ideal female and male prototype, male chauvinist, sexism, and ideas of happiness. The participants were 131 people from Lima-Perú, of them 49 men (37.4%) and 82 women (62.6%) between 16 and 59 years old (Mage = 22,85, SD = 9.05). Through exploratory and predictive correlational analyzes, it was possible to identify that stereotypes of princesses have a greater influence on people with a lower educational level. In addition, it was possible to identify that stereotypes of princesses significantly influence women and men. Finally, the princesses’ influence on women predicts the idea of an ideal male and female, macho and sexist practice, and the ideal of happiness. On the other hand, the princesses influence on males predicts only the idea of an ideal male and female; thus, demonstrating that Disney princess movies predict more ways of thinking about women. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Film media; Gender stereotypes; Male chauvinist; Sexism","Software engineering; Educational levels; Gender stereotypes; Predictive relationships; Ways of thinking; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Ellemers N., Gender stereotypes, Ann.

Socio-cultural linguistics, in particular, examines the use of language and, in particular, the existence and use of neologisms, slang and jargon. These terms capture concepts and expressions that are not in common use and represent the new realities, norms and values of subcommunities. Identifying and understanding such terms, however, is a very complex task, particularly considering the vast amount of content that is currently available online for many such groups. In this paper, we propose a combination of computational and socio-linguistic methods to automatically extract new terminology from large amounts of data, using word-embeddings to semantically contextualise their meaning. As a use case, we explore subculture on the platform Reddit. More specifically, we investigate groups considered part of the manosphere, a loose online community where men's perspectives, gripes, frustrations and desires are explicitly expressed and where women are typically targets of hostility. Characterisations of this group as a subculture are then provided, based on an in-depth analysis of the identified jargon. © 2020 ACM.","jargon; manosphere; misogyny; Reddit; semantics; word embedding","Embeddings; Sociology; Complex task; Cultural studies; In-depth analysis; Large amounts of data; Linguistic methods; On-line communities; Socio-cultural; Linguistics","","","","","","","Minassian A.; Ibrahim Alhojailan M., Thematic analysis: A critical review of its process and evaluation, West East Journal of Social Sciences, 1, 1, pp. 39-47, (2012); Baele S.J., Brace L., Coan T.G., From ""incel"" to ""saint"": Analyzing the violent worldview behind the 2018 toronto attack, Terrorism and Political Violence, pp. 1-25, (2019); Bojanowski P., Grave E., Joulin A., Mikolov T., Enriching word vectors with subword information, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Cartier E., Neoveille, a web platform for neologism tracking, Proceedings of the Software Demonstrations of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics., pp. 95-98, (2017); Chaika E., Jargons and language change, Anthropological Linguistics, 22, 2, pp. 77-96, (1980); Claerbaut D., Black Jargon in White America, (1972); Hill Collins P., Bilge S., Intersectionality, (2016); Paul Cook C., Exploiting Linguistic Knowledge to Infer Properties of Neologisms, (2010); Farrell T., Fernandez M., Novotny J., Alani H., Exploring misogyny across the manosphere in reddit, Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Web Science., pp. 87-96, (2019); Farrell W., The Myth of Male Power, (1996); Alan Fine G., Kleinman S., Rethinking subculture: An interactionist analysis, American Journal of Sociology, 85, 1, pp. 1-20, (1979); Flood M., Backlash: Angry men's movements, The Battle and Backlash Rage On: Why Feminism Cannot Be Obsolete, pp. 261-278, (2004); Ging D., Alphas, betas, and incels: Theorizing the masculinities of the manosphere, Men and Masculinities, (2017); Ging D., Siapera E., Special Issue on Online Misogyny, (2018); Gotell L., Dutton E., Sexual violence in the 'manosphere': Antifeminist men's rights discourses on rape, Int.

The freedom of speech and ease of anonymity granted by social media has also resulted in incitement to hatred. This presents the need for automatic detection of sexist posts or tweets on social media. In this paper, we present the machine learning models that can detect sexism. Specifically, we describe the model submitted for the shared task on sEXism Identification in Social network at IberLeF 2021. The problem concentrates on sexism detection in two languages: English and Spanish. The challenge is divided into two tasks of different granularity: (1) a binary classification problem to discover the instances of sexism in the post and (2) to predict one the five types of sexism present. Overall, our performance is good but it needs some improvement, our scores are encouraging enough to work for better results in future. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Housed in the genre of adventure games, The Walking Dead: Season Two and Life Is Strange appear to follow in the spirit of this emerging women’s revolution but inevitably reestablish traditional presentations of sexism in the treatment of their endings. In particular, the presentation of the infamous Trolley Problem and its inherent utilitarian framework is an incendiary moment wherein these games mark rebellious women as necessary sacrifices for the greater good and the continuation of the community. This article explores these two specific moments of sacrifice at the conclusions of Life Is Strange and The Walking Dead: Season Two and engages with tensions between the status quo and the resistances that challenges these norms. © The Author(s) 2017.","adventure games; binary choices; close reading; damsels in distress; endgames; ethical dilemmas; ethics of care; feminist ethics; gender representation; Life Is Strange; rebel girls; save and sacrifice; the Trolley Problem; The Walking Dead; utilitarianism","","","","","","","","Ahmed S., The promise of happiness, (2010); Ashford E., Utilitarianism, integrity and partiality, The Journal of Philosophy, 97, pp. 421-439, (2000); Brenkert G.G., Marx’s critique of utilitarianism, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 7, pp. 193-220, (1981); Butler J., Gender trouble, (1990); Butt M., Apperley T., Vivian James—The identity politics of #Gamergate’s Avatar, DiGRA/FDG ‘16—Abstract Proceedings of the First International Joint Conference of DiGRA and FDG, 13, (2016); Cassell J., Jenkins H., Chess for girls?

The validity of survey instruments may potentially be at risk if online users and academics, who subsequently advocate for interventions, have competing understandings of trolling. Surveying 120 US-based online users, I find that the spectrum of behaviors classified in the literature as “trolling” do not resonate with respondents. Instead, respondents report that harassment on the basis of race and gender is indicative of trolling. These results suggest a disconnect between academic definitions of trolling that focus on prosocial or humor-based forms of trolling and lay definitions which foreground identity-based harassment and harm. Current instruments that assess trolling behaviors and experiences do not attend to this definition of trolling as identity-based harassment, calling into question construct validity. Furthermore, sociologists identify identity-based harassment as a form of discrimination in other domains of social life, but present measures of discrimination do not consider the online domain. This suggests that studies of everyday discrimination and the implications of mistreatment should extend to online spaces, where racism and sexism are reproduced. © The Author(s) 2020.","everyday discrimination; racism; sexism; trolling","","","","","","","","Almeida J., Johnson R.M., Corliss H.L., Molnar B.E., Azrael D., Emotional distress among LGBT youth: The influence of perceived discrimination based on sexual orientation, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 38, 7, pp. 1001-1014, (2009); Applebaum A., President Trump is now a troll, The Washington Post, (2017); Beyer J., The emergence of a freedom of information movement: Anonymous, Wikileaks, the Pirate Party, and Iceland, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19, pp. 141-154, (2014); Bishop J., Representations of “trolls” in mass media communication: A review of media-texts and moral panics relating to “internet trolling, International Journal of Web Based Communities, 10, 1, pp. 7-24, (2014); Blight M.G., Ruppel E.K., Schoenbauer K.V., Sense of community on Twitter and Instagram: Exploring the roles of motives and parasocial relationships, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 20, 5, pp. 314-319, (2017); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Buckels E.E., Trapnell P.D., Paulhus D.L., Trolls just want to have fun, Personality and Individual Differences, 67, pp. 97-102, (2014); Casler K., Bickel L., Hackett E., Separate but equal?

However, within the past years, the sheer volume of women who have spoken up about sexual harassment has brought the issue to the forefront. This change has been largely driven, in part, by Internet and social media technologies. Given the large size of data posted on these online technologies, it is impossible to manually analyze and organize it; therefore, there is a need to utilize data and text mining methods. In order to help the fight against sexual harassment, this study proposes a predictive framework to collect more than 14,000 sexual harassment reports on the everyday sexism project (ESP) website and identify the space (location) in the reports. Our framework achieves 85.33% accuracy for seven space classes including workplace, public space, home, public transport, school, university, and media. This paper also enriches experiments by merging similar classes (e.g., school and university) and applies a feature selection method to reduce the number of features for efficiency and effectiveness purposes. This enrichment process offers promising results for different sets of classes and features, ranging from 86% – 93% accuracy. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

In view of the growing number of experiences of sexism reported online, categorizing these recollections automatically can assist the fight against sexism, as it can facilitate effective analyses by gender studies researchers and government officials involved in policy making. In this paper, we investigate the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we work with considerably more categories of sexism than any published work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we propose a multi-task approach for fine-grained multi-label sexism classification that leverages several supporting tasks without incurring any manual labeling cost. Unlabeled accounts of sexism are utilized through unsupervised learning to help construct our multi-task setup. We also devise objective functions that exploit label correlations in the training data explicitly. Multiple proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art for multi-label sexism classification on a recently released dataset across five standard metrics. © 2020 COLING 2020 - 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference.

The exposure to sexist speech has serious consequences to women's life and limits their freedom of speech. Previous studies have focused on identifying hatred or violence towards women. However, sexism is expressed in very different forms: it includes subtle stereotypes and attitudes that, although frequently unnoticed, are extremely harmful for both women and society. In this work, we propose a new task that aims to understand and analyze how sexism, from explicit hate or violence to subtle expressions, is expressed in online conversations. To this end, we have developed and released the first dataset of sexist expressions and attitudes in Twitter in Spanish (MeTwo) and investigate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques (both traditional and novel deep learning models) for automatically detecting different types of sexist behaviours. Our results show that sexism is frequently found in many forms in social networks, that it includes a wide range of behaviours, and that it is possible to detect them using deep learning approaches. We discuss the performance of automatic classification methods to deal with different types of sexism and the generalizability of our task to other subdomains, such as misogyny. © 2013 IEEE.","machine learning; natural language processing; Sexism detection; social media","","","","","","","","Wright M.F., Harper B.D., Wachs S., The associations between cyberbullying and callous-unemotional traits among adolescents: The moderating effect of online disinhibition, J.

Misogynistic speech is a kind of abusive language, which can be simplified as hate speech targeting women, and it is becoming a more and more relevant issue in recent years. AMI IberEval 2018 and AMI EVALITA 2018 were two shared tasks which mainly focused on tackling the problem of misogyny in Twitter, in three different languages, namely English, Italian, and Spanish. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on the phenomena of misogyny in those three languages, by focusing on three main objectives. Firstly, we investigate the most important features to detect misogyny and the issues which contribute to the difficulty of misogyny detection, by proposing a novel system and conducting a broad evaluation on this task. Secondly, we study the relationship between misogyny and other abusive language phenomena, by conducting a series of cross-domain classification experiments. Finally, we explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny in a multilingual environment, by carrying out cross-lingual classification experiments. Our system succeeded to outperform all state of the art systems in all benchmark AMI datasets both subtask A and subtask B. Moreover, intriguing insights emerged from error analysis, in particular about the interaction between different but related abusive phenomena. Based on our cross-domain experiment, we conclude that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while we experimentally found that it is different from sexism. Lastly, our cross-lingual experiments show promising results. Our proposed joint-learning architecture obtained a robust performance across languages, worth to be explored in further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive language online; Automatic misogyny identification; Cross-domain classification; Cross-lingual classification; Social media","Data processing; Information management; Cross-domain; Cross-lingual; Important features; In-depth study; Joint learning; Multilingual environments; Robust performance; State-of-the-art system; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Ahluwalia R., Soni H., Callow E., Nascimento A.C.A., Cock M.D., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets, Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-6, (2018); Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on Twitter, Natural language processing and information systems - 23rd international conference on applications of natural language to information systems, NLDB 2018, paris, france, june 13-15, 2018, proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10859, pp. 57-64, (2018); Artetxe M., Schwenk H., Massively multilingual sentence embeddings for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and beyond, TACL, 7, pp. 597-610, (2019); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web companion, perth, australia, april 3-7, 2017, pp. 759-760, (2017); Bakarov A., Vector space models for automatic misogyny identification (short paper), Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-3, (2018); Basile A., Rubagotti C., Crotonemilano for AMI at evalita2018.

This multiple address highlights how the lauded qualities of cult texts are standard in feminine narratives that need to appeal to a large cross section of women. Cult discourse still depends on misogyny and masculinized distinction even when the mainstream mode seems to break down gendered fandom. Contradictions emerge because cult was traditionally defined against the mindless consuming of women. However, the cultish consumption patterns for FSOG are deliberately fostered by merchandising strategies. Thus, the same element that shows cult tendencies is used to denigrate the film as the antithesis of cult: women as consumers. © 2019 The Author.","American Psycho; cult; fandom; feminine media; Fifty Shades of Grey (FSOG); The Fall; women","","","","","","","","Abad-Santos A., Why Wonder Woman's Second-weekend Sales Are so Extraordinary-and Important: Wonder Woman's Second Weekend Was Better Than Those of Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, (2017); Abrams J.J., Burk B., Kennedy K., Abrams J.J., Star Wars: Episode VII-The Force Awakens [Motion Picture], (2015); Al-Mahadin S., Is christian a sadist?, Fifty Shades of Grey in Popular Imagination.

We focus on task A -Misogyny and Aggressive Behaviour Identification- which aims at detecting whether a tweet in Italian is misogynous and, if so, whether it is aggressive. Rather than building two different models, one for misogyny and one for aggressiveness identification, we handle the problem as one single multi-label classification task, considering three classes: non-misogynous, non-aggressive misogynous, and aggressive misogynous. Our three-class supervised model, built on top of AlBERTo, obtains an overall F1 score of 0.7438 on the task test set (F1 = 0.8102 for the misogyny and F1 = 0.6774 for the aggressiveness task), which outperforms the top submitted model (F1 = 0.7406).

While critical scholars posit that online gender harassment may be linked to men's anxieties about fulfilling normative masculine gender roles, this relationship has not been examined by empirical research. We survey 264 young men between the ages of 18-24 about their masculinity anxieties and their perceptions of harassment directed at a woman on Twitter. We find that men who perceive themselves as less masculine than average men report higher endorsement of harassment. Further, we find that the relationship between masculinity anxieties and harassment endorsement is mediated by men's adherence to masculine norms and toxic disinhibition. We interpret these results through the lens of social media's specific affordances, and we discuss their implications for technology designers and other practitioners who wish to better detect, prevent, and remediate online harassment by accounting for the role of gender. © 2020 ACM.","gender; masculinity; misogyny; online harassment; social media; women","Human engineering; Affordances; Disinhibition; Empirical research; Gender roles; Online environments; Social media; Through the lens; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Toxic Twitter-Triggers of Violence and Abuse Against Women on Twitter, (2018); Jensen Arnett J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties, American Psychologist, 55, 5, pp. 469-480, (2000); Banet-Weiser S., Miltner K.M., #masculinitysofragile: Culture, structure, and networked misogyny, Feminist Media Studies, 16, 1, pp. 171-174, (2016); Barlett J., Norrie R., Patel N., Rumpel R., Wibberley, Misogyny on twitter, Demos, (2014); Berke D.S., Reidy D.E., Miller J.D., Zeichner A., Take it like a man: Gender-threatened men's experience of gender role discrepancy, emotion activation, and pain tolerance, Psychology of Men & Masculinity, 18, 1, pp. 62-69, (2017); Blackwell L., Chen T., Schoenebeck S., Lampe C., When online harassment is perceived as justified, Twelfth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, (2018); Blackwell L., Dimond J., Schoenebeck S., Lampe C., Classification and its consequences for online harassment: Design insights from heartmob, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction 1, CSCW, pp. 1-19, (2017); Braithwaite A., It's about ethics in games journalism?

Hate speech detection can be done by utilizing text mining technology. There have been many hate speech detection studies conducted. To identify and analyze research trends, data sources, methods and features used in hate speech detection, this systematic literature review was created. Until early 2020, the topics of hate speech were found, including hate speech against minorities, religion, women, the general election agenda, and politics. Sources of data that are widely used to be used as datasets come from twitter. Hate speech is not only classified into HS (hate speech) and Non-HS (non-hate speech) but can be further classified into racism, sexism, offensive, abusive, threats of violence and others. Of the 38 studies that meet inclusion and exclusion, there are 26 algorithms and 28 features that have been used to detect hate speech. However, these methods and features do not necessarily guarantee a good hate detection performance. Hate speech classification performance is also influenced by the dataset, the features chosen, the number of classes and mutually exclusive classes. © 2020 IEEE.","classification; hate speech; systematic literature review; text mining","Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Intelligent systems; Social networking (online); Speech; Text mining; Detection performance; General Elections; Inclusion and exclusions; Number of class; Research trends; Speech classification; Speech detection; Systematic literature review; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Kitchenham B., Charters S., Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Enginering, pp. 1-44, (2007); Hall T., Beecham S., Bowes D., Gray D., Counsell S., A systematic literature review on fault prediction performance in software engineering, IEEE Trans.

By outwardly foregrounding diversity through explicitly absurd presentations, our investigation uses humor and farce to draw attention to how such efforts further entrench the very forms of institutional racism, ableism, and sexism they are meant to disrupt, for example, by creating additional work for the people they are designed to include.

Sexism permeates many layers of our society such as media, education or the work environment, and involves many aspects of our society such as gender equality, social respect, gender discrimantion, human rights, etc. In order to fight against this phenomenon, the first step is detecting it properly and in all its varieties. For that purpose, we present our candidate systems for participation in the EXIST challenge (task 1) at IberLEF 2021 for sexism identification. We explore an approach based on the use of pre-trained transformers, such as BERT and roBERTa, in similar tasks and compare them to traditional Machine Learning approaches, such as SVM, Logistic Regression, SGD-based classifier and XGBoost. We achieve our best results of F1=72.4% for the multi-language binary classification task for our system combining transformer-based and traditional models with a majority vote mechanism, positioned #32 in the challenge's ranking, with a F1 difference of 6% against the best result. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Several machine and deep learning approaches have been proposed recently for detecting various types of aggressive behavior. However, social media are fast paced, generating an increasing amount of content, while aggressive behavior evolves over time. In this work, we introduce the first, practical, real-time framework for detecting aggression on Twitter via embracing the streaming machine learning paradigm. Our method adapts its ML classifiers in an incremental fashion as it receives new annotated examples and is able to achieve the same (or even higher) performance as batch-based ML models, with over 90% accuracy, precision, and recall. At the same time, our experimental analysis on real Twitter data reveals how our framework can easily scale to accommodate the entire Twitter Firehose (of 778 million tweets per day) with only 3 commodity machines. Finally, we show that our framework is general enough to detect other related behaviors such as sarcasm, racism, and sexism in real time. © 2020 IEEE.","online aggression detection; social media; streaming machine learning","Big data; Deep learning; E-learning; Social networking (online); Experimental analysis; Fire-hose; Learning approach; Online aggressions; Real time; Social media; Learning systems","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691025, 830927)","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research leading to these results has received funding from the EU’s H2020 Programme, No 691025 (MSCA-RISE project ENCASE) and No 830927 (project CONCORDIA).

Treatment as Prevention®, or TasP, has relied on HIV treatment to prevent HIV transmission, targeting people living with HIV. However, TasP is predicated on troublesome heterosexist, classist, and racist medical practices borrowed from various times and spaces that enact biopolitical and necropolitical relations. This paper discusses the debate surrounding the first clinical trial that used HIV treatment to prevent transmission from woman-to-foetus. The 1994 landmark AIDS Clinical Trials Group 076 study laid the groundwork for using HIV treatment to prevent HIV transmission, the essential precursor to TasP. By examining the concerns of HIV positive women of colour and other AIDS activists, we are able to understand the ethical dilemmas and practical consequences that still haunt today’s game-changing uses of HIV treatment for prevention and to see how biopolitics and necropolitics persist in TasP. © Edinburgh University Press.","ACTG 076; AIDS activism; Clinical trial; HIV/AIDS; Prevention; Racism; Sexism; Treatment","","","","","","New York City Municipal Archives; Women’s Studies at Simon Fraser University; Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete, Sida; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, IRSC","I would like to thank the New York City Municipal Archives and SIDA STUDI for allowing me to access their materials.

With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better. AI is an opportunity and a mirror for all disciplines to improve their impact on society and for medicine the stakes could not be higher. © 2020","Artificial intelligence; Bias; Data science; Digital health; Disparities; Health; Healthcare; Inequality; Medicine","Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Bias; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Health care; AI systems; Health disparities; Research communities; Scaled-up; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; coronavirus disease 2019; data science; differential diagnosis; health care; health care disparity; health disparity; health equity; mental health; pandemic; priority journal; racism; sex difference; sexism; sexual and gender minority; statistical bias; automation; human; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Dr Jaya Aysola","I would like to thank Professor Dominique G.

However, there is a danger that their coincidental timing implies that the latter is the solution to the former; that a voice assistant with a genderless voice cannot be sexist. This paper outlines how gender is not inherent in voice - listeners assign gender to voice. Also, this paper highlights that gender is constructed through a multitude of resources. Thus, a genderless voice is redundant if other elements of the voice assistant's design cause it to be gendered. I posit two take-homes; i) a change of terminology to gender ambiguous will help reframe how we think about gender in voice assistants, and ii) that we should critically engage with all potentially gendering elements in the design of voice assistants, not just the voice, in order to consider gender in a more sensitive manner. © 2020 ACM.","Design; Gender; Voice Assistants; Voice User Interfaces","Computer applications; Computer programming; Coincidental timings; Voice user interface; User interfaces","","","","","","","Bardzell J., Bardzell S., Humanistic HCI. 23, 2, 2016, pp. 20-29, (2016); Bussmann H., Speech?

Despite worldwide efforts to promote gender equality, typically, women account for less than 30% of the workforce in technological areas. In third world countries, the situation is much more unbalanced. Poor educational and economic conditions, allied with a chauvinism culture contaminated by sexism and stereotypes, are strong forces that repel the young girls from IT areas. As a result, the percentage of women in local Computer Science majors is lower than expected. The authors detail a program to involve girls from all school levels in computer science career, which is indeed the adaptation of a national program, combined with indigenous elements. The mentioned adaptation was a key success factor to catch the attention of students and local educators. Some activities that are included in this program are lectures at scientific, technological and gender discussion events, realization of dynamics in schools for the dissemination of computational thinking in children and young students, training students to take part in programming contests and develop knowledge into real computational applications. These actions resulted in highlights achieved in programming contests and prizes obtained through application development, and have provided a more conducive academic environment to discuss issues related to the female gender in science and technology fields. Besides the fundamentals of the program, the authors present the results of the last three initiatives, which happened in conjunction with local events, and the promising opportunities perceived in Computer Science major of a local university. © 2018 IEEE.","Diversity politics, STEM education; Gender equality; Women inclusion and leadership","Application programs; Application development; Computational applications; Computational thinkings; Gender equality; Science and Technology; STEM education; Third-world countries; Women inclusion and leadership; Students","","","","","","","IPEA.

This research investigated if sexist nonverbal behavior of a male instructor could activate stereotype threat among women in a virtual classroom. In addition, the research examined if learners' avatar representation in virtual reality altered this nonverbal process. Specifically, a 2 (avatar gender: female vs. male) × 2 (instructor behavior: dominant sexist vs. nondominant or nonsexist) between-subjects experiment was used. Data from 76 female college students demonstrated that participants learned less and performed worse when interacting with a sexist male instructor compared with a nonsexist instructor in a virtual classroom. Participants learned and performed equally well when represented by female and male avatars. Our findings extend previous research in physical learning settings, suggesting that dominant-sexist behaviors may give rise to stereotype threat and undermine women's learning outcomes in virtual classrooms. Implications for gender achievement gaps and stereotype threat are discussed. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","gender; social identity; stereotype threat; virtual learning; virtual reality","Computer Graphics; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematics; Sexism; Stereotyping; Students; Virtual Reality; Women; adult; article; college student; female; gender; human; human experiment; learning environment; major clinical study; male; nonverbal communication; social status; stereotypy; virtual reality; computer graphics; education; mathematics; psychology; sexism; stereotyping; student","","","","","","","Reardon S.F., Fahle E.M., Kalogrides D., Et al., Gender achievement gaps in U.

Monitoring the contents including sexism and sexual harassment in traditional media is easier than monitoring on the online social media platforms like Twitter, because of the large amount of user generated content in these media. So, the research about the automated detection of content containing sexual or racist harassment is an important issue and could be the basis for removing that content or flagging it for human evaluation. Previous studies have been focused on collecting data about sexism and racism in very broad terms. However, there is no much study focusing on different types of online harassment attracting natural language processing techniques. In this work, we present an multi-attention based approach for the detection of different types of harassment in tweets. Our approach is based on the Recurrent Neural Networks and particularly we are using a deep, classification specific multi-attention mechanism. Moreover, we tackle the problem of imbalanced data, using a back-translation method. Finally, we present a comparison between different approaches based on the Recurrent Neural Networks. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Hate speech; Text classification; Twitter","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Attention mechanisms; Automated detection; Back translations; Human evaluation; NAtural language processing; Online social medias; Sexual harassment; User-generated content; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","","","Jha A., Mamidi R., When does a compliment become sexist: Analysis and classification of ambivalent sexism using Twitter data, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, (2017); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people: Predictive features for hate speech detection on Twitter, Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, pp. 88-93, (2016); Sharifirad S., Matwin S., Classification of Different Types of Sexist Languages on Twitter and the Gender Footprint on Each of the Classes, (2018); Sharifirad S., Matwin S., When a tweet is actually sexist, A More Comprehensive Classification of Different Online Harassment Categories and the Challenges in NLP, (2019); Sharifirad S., Matwin S., Jafarpour B., How is Your Mood When Writing Sexist Tweets?

This paper explores three facets of technologically related gendered harm: physical, institutional, and psychological. These harms will be demonstrated by case studies. Firstly, technology can cause physical harm by denying women their bodily autonomy, demonstrated by the public availability of AI software that generates nude pictures of women, and smart home devices used in instances of domestic abuse. Secondly, technology can deny women institutional access, as increasingly widespread algorithms are shown to underperform on marginalised groups. Thirdly, anthropomorphised technology reflects and entrenches harmful stereotypes of women's submissiveness, causing psychological harm. Reducing harm must go beyond ensuring a diversity of representation in STEM fields. We conclude that effective regulation should focus on the design features in technological innovations. © 2020, Australasian Association for Information Systems.","Bias; Diversity; Gender; Machine learning: AI; Sexism; STEM; Technology; Women","","","","","","","","(2018); Family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia: Continuing the national story, (2019); Baranyai K., Bowles J., Hassan S., Prinsley R., Smith P., Walter C., Australia's STEM Workforce, (2016); Bargad A., Hyde J.S., Women's Studies: A Study of Feminist Identity Development in Women, Psychology of Women Quarterly, (2016); Barratt B., The Need For More Women In STEM Roles Goes Beyond Simple Diversity, Forbes, (2018); Bowles N., Thermostats, Locks and Lights: Digital Tools of Domestic Abuse, The New York Times, (2018); Buolamwini J., Gebru T., Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification, Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, 81, pp. 77-91, (2018); Clance P.R., Imes S.A., The imposter phenomenon in high achieving women: Dynamics and therapeutic intervention, Psychotherapy: Theory, Research & Practice, 15, 3, pp. 241-247, (1978); Cole S., Maiberg E., Koebler J., This Horrifying App Undresses a Photo of Any Woman With a Single Click, Vice, (2019); Crenshaw K., Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics, University of Chicago Legal Forum, 1989, 1, (2015); Advancing Women in STEM, (2019); Fricker M., Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing, Epistemic Injustice, (2007); Layne L., Vostral S.L., Boyer K., Feminist Technology, (2010); MacMillan D., Dwoskin E., The war inside Palantir: Data-mining firm's ties to ICE under attack by employees, Washington Post, (2019); McKinley N.M., Hyde J.S., The Objectified Body Consciousness Scale: Development and Validation, Psychology of Women Quarterly, (1996); Medina J., The Epistemology of Resistance: Gender and Racial Oppression, Epistemic Injustice, and the Social Imagination, The Epistemology of Resistance, (2013); Patterson D., Why having more women in tech management is good for business, Tech Republic, (2018); Perry R., Greber L., Women and Computers: An Introduction, Signs, 16, 1, pp. 74-101, (1990); Poulsen A., Burmeister O.K., Overcoming carer shortages with care robots: Dynamic value trade-offs in run-time, Australasian Journal of Information Systems, 23, (2019); Rakow L.F., Gendered technology, gendered practice, Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 5, 1, pp. 57-70, (1988); Richardson K., Sex Robot Matters: Slavery, the Prostituted, and the Rights of Machines, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 35, 2, pp. 46-53, (2016); Rodriguez M., Valentine J.M., Son J.B., Muhammad M., Intimate Partner Violence and Barriers To Mental Health Care for Ethnically Diverse Populations of Women, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse, (2009); Rothschild J.A., A feminist perspective on technology and the future, Women's Studies International Quarterly, 4, 1, pp. 65-74, (1981); Schwar H., Moynihan R., Companies like Amazon may give devices like Alexa female voices to make them seem ""caring. , Business Insider, (2020); Simonite T., When it comes to gorillas, Google photos remains blind, Wired Magazine, (2018); Wajcman J., From Women and Technology to Gendered Technoscience, Information, Communication & Society, 10, 3, pp. 287-298, (2007); Wang Y., Kosinski M., Deep neural networks are more accurate than humans at detecting sexual orientation from facial images, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 114, 2, pp. 246-257, (2017); West M., Kraut R., Chew H.E., I'd blush if I could: Closing gender divides in digital skills through education, (2019); West S.M., Whittaker M., Crawford K., Discriminating Systems: Gender, Race, and Power in AI, (2019); Williams S., Why We Need Women in STEM, Inc, (2014)","L.

Particularly, regarding ageing women. On digital platforms, individuals would have a greater agency to perform and shape gender norms and sexual roles. However, scholarship has been expressing scepticism with the liberatory promise of the online realm, as well as cautions with digital network harassment and the so-called nanosphere. Yet, little is known about how exactly misogynistic rhetoric operates on popular social media to discipline ageing women’s feminity. This paper extends the feminist scholarship to the field of Instagram, focusing specifically on representations of the pop star Madonna. It presents an analysis of how ageing women femininities representations are mobilised on Instagram through a case study of posts indexed with hashtags. Applying computational methods and drawing on the insights of Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis, it approaches these networked representations by exploring the interplay between sexism and ageism within the misogynistic driven forces targeting Madonna and her ageing feminity. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ageism; Online misogyny; Social media","Computer science; Computers; Ageing woman; Critical discourse analysis; Digital networks; Digital platforms; Driven force; Mainstream media; New media; Social media; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (GENDER RESEARCH 4 COVID-19–058)","Acknowledgements.

With the increase in the number of people online, individuals inclined towards racism, misogyny, etc have led to the spread of hate speech online. It's high time that proper steps must be taken to curb this issue with one major step being to identify people who are spreading hate speech on Twitter. We have tried to perform the above task using natural language processing techniques for two different languages English and Spanish on the two datasets provided by PAN @CLEF 2021. Four machine learning classifiers (i) multinomial naive Bayes, (ii) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, (iii) logistic regression and (iv) linear SVM, along with three deep learning models (i) Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short term Memory (bi-LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers (BERT) model were implemented for the identification of hate speech spreader. The experiments with all the mentioned models on the training dataset provided by PAN (by splitting it into training and testing datasets) revealed that the multinomial naive Bayes is the best model with an accuracy of 74% for the English dataset and 82% for the Spanish dataset. The multinomial naive Bayes model yielded an accuracy of 66% for the English dataset and 80% for the Spanish dataset with the unknown private dataset used by the organizers for the final evaluation of the models. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Although extant journalism and social media scholarship successfully delineate the manosphere as a significant social problem by associating it with misogynist cybercrime and cyberhate, the resulting narrative simplistically pathologizes manosphere discourse while leaving its misogyny undertheorized. In this article, I complicate this emerging narrative by demonstrating how a certain central manosphere discourse qualitatively overlaps with a broader neoliberal ideology. I do so by further developing a critical discourse analysis of quasi-representative manosphere documents drawn from “The Red Pill,” a sub-forum of Reddit.com. Although this forum is explicitly devoted to discussing heterosexual seduction strategies, I find that it also produces a discursive means for fiscally conservative men to reconcile their pro-capitalist economic beliefs with apparent evidence of capitalism’s destructive tendencies and contradictions. This forum’s anti-feminist discourse implicitly parallels Marxian theory while explicitly supporting free market capitalism and denigrating women, thereby providing men with a linguistic and conceptual framework to scapegoat women for economic problems while leaving neoliberal ideas and assumptions unchallenged. © The Author(s) 2019.","critical discourse analysis; manosphere; Marx; masculinities; neoliberalism; Reddit; seduction","","","","","","","","Au W., A Marxist education: Learning to change the world, (2018); Baker P.C., Hunting the manosphere, The New York Times, (2017); Banet-Weiser S., Miltner K.M., #MasculinitySoFragile: Culture, structure, and networked misogyny, Feminist Media Studies, 16, pp. 171-174, (2016); Blake M., Mad men: Inside the men’s rights movement—And the army of misogynists and trolls it spawned, Mother Jones, (2015); Brown W., Undoing the demos: Neoliberalism’s stealth revolution, (2015); Chess S., Shaw A., A conspiracy of fishes, or, how we learned to stop worrying about #GamerGate and embrace hegemonic masculinity, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 59, pp. 208-220, (2015); Cloud D.L., The matrix and critical theory’s desertion of the deal, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 3, pp. 329-354, (2006); Cohen R., Welcome to the manosphere: A brief guide to the controversial men’s rights movement, Mother Jones, (2015); Colleoni E., Rozza A., Arvidsson A., Echo chamber or public sphere?

Given the rising number of experiences of sexism reported online, categorizing these recollections automatically can aid the fight against sexism, as it can facilitate effective analyses by gender studies researchers and government officials involved in policy making. In this paper, we explore the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism wherein the approach goes beyond merely fine-tuning pre-trained models using unlabeled data. We devise self-training based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. Several proposed methods outperform a variety of baselines on a recently released dataset for multi-label sexism categorization across several standard metrics. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fine-grained categorization; Multi-label classification; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification","Classification (of information); Information systems; Information use; Systems engineering; Class imbalance; Effective analysis; Government officials; Multi label classification; Problem formulation; Semi-supervised; Standard metrics; Unlabeled samples; Semi-supervised learning","","","","","","","Abney S., Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics, (2007); Agrawal S., Awekar A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms, ECIR 2018.

Apart from slurs being offensive in conversations, slurs vary in usage to express contempt, difference of opinions, and in some cases humor. Abusive language can potentially be used to offend someone, to promote racism, sexism, etc. Hindi is the third most popular language in the world, based on the number of speakers globally. It is spoken by millions of Indians from different regional influences and linguistic preferences it has become very rich in it's diversity and usage. While ""Hinglish"" (Hindi written in Roman script instead of the native Devanagari) is extensively used online, native Hindi speakers who write in Devanagari are on a steady rise. Despite this, little research has been done on the use of Hindi as an online language. This paper presents a model to distinguish and then classify offensive text from non-offensive using a fast Text-based model The model was able to classify text from a Devanagari Hindi Offensive Tweets (DHOT) data corpus. A grid-search method was applied to tune hyperparameters during fast Text model runs, and provided interesting insights on the model accuracy and precision. Our fast Text model achieved 92.2% accuracy employing desktop class machine for the processing. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish a state of the art classification of offensive text in Hindi using fast Text models. © 2020 The Authors.

Text classification for online content is a bit challenging task due to the natural language complexity and hastily generated online user microblogs including a plethora of informality and mistakes. This work introduces a system to classify tweets in three categories (i.e., racism, sexism and none). In our classification strategy, we integrate deep features extracted from Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) trained on semantic word embedding with state-of-the-art syntactic and word n-gram features. We perform comprehensive experiments on a standard dataset containing 16k manually annotated tweets.

It used a 2 (Specialist AI/Generalist AI) × 2 (Sexist/nonsexist) design to test the relationship between these labels and the perception of moral violations. The theoretical framework was an integration of the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) and Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) approaches. Participants (n = 233) responded to an online questionnaire after reading one of four scenarios involving an AI recruiter’s evaluation of job candidates. Results found that the concept of “mindlessness” in CASA is situational, based on whether the issue is processed with the central route or the peripheral route. Moreover, this study shows that CASA can explain the evaluation of machines with the third-person point of view. Also, there was a distinction between the perception of the AI and its decisions. Furthermore, participants were found to be more sensitive about the AI agent’s sexism–which was more anthropomorphic and emotionally engaging–than about the AI agent’s status as a specialist. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Computers are social actors; Elaboration likelihood models; Online questionnaire; Theoretical framework; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Appelman A., Sundar S., Measuring message credibility: Construction and validation of an exclusive scale, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 93, 1, pp. 59-79, (2016); Barnes T.D., Beaulieu E., Saxton G.W., Sex and corruption: How sexism shapes voters’ responses to scandal, Politics, Groups, and Identities, 8, 1, pp. 103-121, (2020); Beran O., An attitude towards an artificial soul?

With the increase in the use of social media, this feeling of hatred toward women and immigrants can be more easily expressed, and therefore it can have harmful effects on social media users. For this reason, it is important to develop systems capable of detecting hateful comments automatically. In this article, we analyze the hate speech in Spanish tweets against women and immigrants conducting classification experiments using different approaches. Moreover, we create appropriate language resources for hate speech detection in Spanish. © 2020 ACM.","classifier ensemble; hate speech classification; lexicon; machine learning; Misogyny detection; social media; text mining; xenophobia detection","Internet; Harmful effects; Language resources; Language technology; Social media; Social problems; Speech detection; Social networking (online)","","","","","Fondo Europeo de De-sarrollo Regional, (TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R); Spanish government","This work was partially supported by the LIVING-LANG project (RTI2018-094653-B-C21) and the Fondo Europeo de De-sarrollo Regional (FEDER) and REDES project (TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R) from the Spanish government.

In the present work, we investigate a range of alternative implementations of three of these tasks - namely, hate speech, aggressive behavior and target group recognition - by presenting a number of experiments involving different learning methods, including regularized logistic regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep bidirectional transformers (BERT), and using word embeddings, word n-grams, character n-grams and psycholinguistics-motivated (LIWC) features alike. Results suggest that a purely data-driven BERT model, and to some extent also a hybrid psycholinguisticly informed CNN model, generally outperform the alternatives under consideration for all tasks in both English and Spanish languages. © 2020 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

We not only need an efficient automatic hate speech detection model based on advanced machine learning and natural language processing, but also a sufficiently large amount of annotated data to train a model. The lack of a sufficient amount of labelled hate speech data, along with the existing biases, has been the main issue in this domain of research. To address these needs, in this study we introduce a novel transfer learning approach based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). More specifically, we investigate the ability of BERT at capturing hateful context within social media content by using new fine-tuning methods based on transfer learning. To evaluate our proposed approach, we use two publicly available datasets that have been annotated for racism, sexism, hate, or offensive content on Twitter. The results show that our solution obtains considerable performance on these datasets in terms of precision and recall in comparison to existing approaches. Consequently, our model can capture some biases in data annotation and collection process and can potentially lead us to a more accurate model. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","BERT; Fine-tuning; Hate speech detection; Language modeling; NLP; Social media; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Et al., Deep Learning for Hate Speech Detection in Tweets, (2017); Davidson T., Bhattacharya D., Weber I., Racial Bias in Hate Speech and Abusive Language Detection Datasets, (2019); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M.W., Et al., Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M., Lee K., Et al., BERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Djuric N., Zhou J., Morris R., Et al., Hate speech detection with comment embeddings, Proceedings of the 24Th International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW 2015, Companion, pp. 29-30, (2015); Fortuna P., Nunes S., A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text, ACM Comput.

Most existing designs that aim to combat stigma draw on an 'information and awareness' approach that is often inadequate to address stigma's deeper roots. To address this gap, we have conducted an interview and design study in five special needs schools1 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, involving twenty-nine parents and nine teachers. Based on our study, we present how the primary caretakers of children with autism face the stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and how misogyny, economic apprehension, and misinformation generate this stigma. Drawing from a range of scholarly work in sociology and psychology, we demonstrate how those factors are rooted in the colonial history and contemporary social hierarchy of Bangladesh. Based on our participatory design sessions, we introduce and analyze potential design directions and connect our findings to the politics of inclusion and social justice in the context of the developing world. © 2020 ACM.","Autism; Bangladesh; Design; LMIC; Mental health; Social Justice; Stigma","Developing countries; Sociology; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Critical challenges; Developing world; Participatory design; Scholarly works; Social hierarchy; Social justice; Diseases","","","","","International Fulbright; National Institute of Health, (1R21MH116726-01); Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (-2018-0); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (892191082); Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI, (37608)","This research was made possible by the generous grants from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (#RGPIN-2018-0), Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (#892191082), Canada Foundation for Innovation (#37608), Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (#37608), National Institute of Health (#1R21MH116726-01), and International Fulbright Centennial Fellowship of Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed.","Ernesto Abadia-Barrero C., The cultural politics of the Brazilian AIDS social movement: A local and global revolution, Latin American Studies Association Conference, (2003); Ernesto Abadia-Barrero C., Castro A., Experiences of stigma and access to haart in children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS in Brazil, Social Science & Medicine, 62, 5, pp. 1219-1228, (2006); Afroz S., Carl Tschantz M., Sajid S., Asif Qazi S., Javed M., Paxson V., Exploring Server-side Blocking of Regions, (2018); Agadjanian V., Sen S., Promises and challenges of faith-based AIDS care and support in Mozambique, American Journal of Public Health, 97, 2, pp. 362-366, (2007); Ahmed S., Forhad Hossain M., Price K., Pranger C., Monsur Hossain M., Sharmin M., A tale of the social-side of asd, 2019 IEEE 43rd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), 1, pp. 644-652, (2019); Ishtiaque Ahmed S., Romael Haque M., Guha S., Rashidujjaman Rifat M., Dell N., Privacy, security, and surveillance in the global south: A study of biometric mobile sim registration in Bangladesh, Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.

Serious accusations have been levied against it for its role in encouraging misogyny and violent threats towards women online, as well as for potentially radicalising lonely or disenfranchised men. Feminist scholars evidence this through a shift in the language and interests of some men's rights activists on the manosphere, away from traditional subjects of family law or mental health and towards more sexually explicit, violent, racist and homophobic language. In this paper, we study this phenomenon by investigating the flow of extreme language across seven online communities on Reddit, with openly misogynistic members (e.g., Men Going Their Own Way, Involuntarily Celibates), and investigate if and how misogynistic ideas spread within and across these communities. Grounded on feminist critiques of language, we created nine lexicons capturing specific misogynistic rhetoric (Physical Violence, Sexual Violence, Hostility, Patriarchy, Stoicism, Racism, Homophobia, Belittling, and Flipped Narrative) and used these lexicons to explore how language evolves within and across misogynistic groups. This analysis was conducted on 6 million posts, from 300K conversations created between 2011 and December 2018. Our results shows increasing patterns on misogynistic content and users as well as violent attitudes, corroborating existing theories of feminist studies that the amount of misogyny, hostility and violence is steadily increasing in the manosphere. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Feminist studies; Hate; Misogyny; Reddit","Family law; Feminist studies; Hate; Mental health; Misogyny; On-line communities; Reddit; Laws and legislation","","","","","","","Minassian A.; Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, Int.

The identification and classification of sexism in social media are very relevant tasks, as they would allow building a healthier social environment. Nevertheless, these tasks are considerably challenging. This work proposes a system to use multilingual and monolingual BERT and data points translation and ensemble strategies for sexism identification and classification in English and Spanish. It was conducted in the context of the sEXism Identification in Social neTworks shared 2021 (EXIST 2021) task, proposed by the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF). The proposed system and its main components are described, and an in-depth hyperparameters analysis is conducted. The main results observed were: (i) the system obtained better results than the baseline model (multilingual BERT); (ii) ensemble models obtained better results than monolingual models; and (iii) an ensemble model considering all individual models and the best standardized values obtained the best accuracies and F1-scores for both tasks. This work obtained first place in both tasks at EXIST, with the highest accuracies (0.780 for task 1 and 0.658 for task 2) and F1-scores (F1-binary of 0.780 for task 1 and F1-macro of 0.579 for task 2). © 2021 CEUR-WS.

This is not an issue that can be addressed by individual states alone, nor can it be addressed satisfactorily through legal means. The normalization of misogyny and abuse online both reflects and reinforces systemic inequalities. Addressing gender-based violence online will require the intervention of the technology companies that govern the commercial Internet to prevent and combat abuse across networks and services. We argue that international human rights instruments provide an opportunity to identify with more precision the responsibilities of telecommunications companies and digital media platforms to mitigate harm perpetrated through their networks, and ensure that the systems they create do not reproduce gendered inequality. Finally, we present initial recommendations for platforms to promote human rights and fulfill their responsibilities under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization","gender-based violence; governance; human rights; intermediaries; platforms; social media","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (637768); Australian Research Council, (DE160101542)","Suzor is the recipient of an Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship (project number DE160101542). 1. #gamergate is a harassment campaign started by game developer Zoe Quinn’s ex-boyfriend.

In this work, we address this sentence classification task from a representation learning perspective, using both a bidirectional LSTM and BERT optimized with the following metric learning loss functions: contrastive loss, triplet loss, center loss, congenerous cosine loss and additive angular margin loss. We set new state-of-the-art for the task with our fine-tuned BERT, whose sentence embeddings can be compared with a simple cosine distance, and we release all our code as open source for easy reproducibility. Moreover, we find that almost every loss function performs equally well in this setting, matching the regular cross entropy loss. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Open systems; Classification tasks; Embeddings; Learning approach; Loss functions; Metric learning; Natural languages; Open-source; Sentence classifications; Simple++; State of the art; Long short-term memory","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","This work has been partially funded by the LIHLITH project (ANR-17-CHR2-0001-03), and supported by ERA-Net CHIST-ERA, and the “Agence Nationale pour la Recherche” (ANR, France).

The dataset used is as set of tweets and the first task was on the detection of harassment tweets. To deal with this problem, we proposed a solution based on a gradient tree-boosting algorithm. The second task was categorization harassment tweets according to the type of harassment, a multiclass classification problem. For this problem we proposed a LSTM network model. The solutions proposed for these tasks presented good predictive accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Harassment detection; Sexism analysis; Twitter mining","Machine learning; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Gradient boosting; Gradient tree boosting; Multiclass classification problems; Network modeling; Predictive accuracy; Social media; Long short-term memory","","","","","","","Chen T., Guestrin C., XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system.

In this article, we ask: how does “consent” as an analytical framework make visible the social dynamics and power relations in the capture, extraction, and labor of data science knowledge production? We hypothesize that a form of boundary violation in data science workplaces—gender harassment—may correlate with the ways humans’ lived experiences are extracted to produce Big Data. The concept of consent offers a useful way to draw comparisons between gender relations in data science and the means by which machines are trained to learn and reason. Inspired by how Big Tech leaders describe unsupervised machine learning, and the co-optation of “revolutionary” rhetoric they use to do so, we introduce a concept we call “techniques of invisibility.” Techniques of invisibility are the ways in which an extreme imbalance between exposure and opacity, demarcated along fault lines of power, are fabricated and maintained, closing down the possibility for bidirectional transparency in the production and applications of algorithms. Further, techniques of invisibility, which we group into two categories—epistemic injustice and the Brotherhood—include acts of subjection by powerful actors in data science designed to quell resistance to exploitative relations. These techniques may be useful in making further connections between epistemic violence, sexism, and surveillance, sussing out persistent boundary violations in data science to render the social in data science visible, and open to scrutiny and debate. © The Author(s) 2021.","consent; data science; Feminism; gender harassment; privacy; surveillance","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (NSF 1751314)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by an National Science Foundation Engineering Education and Centers Grant NSF 1751314.

However, little is known about how Tinder has obtained this notoriety and what Tinder is actually responsible for. This study analyzes talks about Tinder on Reddit (/r/Tinder), as part of Tinder culture where Tinder discourse and norms are established and shared in relation to broader youth pairing culture. Through a lens of feminist media scholarship, I show that an association between Tinder and hookups is couched in a gendered code of conduct, coolness. I argue that this gendered coolness in the economy of visibility of Tinder evokes and justifies misogyny online in line with the sexism inherent to hookup culture. © The Author(s) 2019.","cool; hookup;

Basing their research on an interdisciplinary approach, the authors aim at critically reviewing the construction and representation of gender identities in proverbs using Glick and Fiske's Ambivalent Sexism Theory and Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis of proverbs culled from published collections and Internet sources. The study focuses among other things on how men are represented in proverbs as opposed to women when it comes to physical, emotional, intellectual, financial, and leadership qualities. Amongst other things, this study shows how discourses of biological essentialism are used to justify what is presented as a natural gender order and the effects of these perceptions on the social order. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ambivalent sexism theory; Feminist critical discourse analysis; Gender ideologies; Linguistic sexism; Proverbs","","","","","","Carnegie Corporation of New York, CCNY; Andrew W.

A thematic qualitative text analysis based on the grounded theory approach was conducted on posts and comments that were published on the Facebook page of the Israeli grassroots movement Women Wage Peace (WWP), created by the Jewish and Arab women that participate in this movement. Our findings point to three major mechanisms through which attempts to mobilize peace were performed: building solidarity, maintaining engagement, and calling for action, thus contributing to our understanding of social media as a dialogue-provoking platform that enables users from different gender and ethnopolitical groups in divided and conflicted societies to perform peacebuilding actions. However, the findings indicate that at the same time, the page also constitutes a space for blatant expressions of hostility, hatred, and sexism that convey a backlash against the initiative and activity of WWP. © The Author(s) 2020.","asymmetric conflict; dialogue; Facebook; Israeli–Palestinian conflict; mobilization; online political participation; social media; women and peace","","","","","","Lady Davis Fellowship at the Hebrew University; Swiss Center for Conflict Research","The Authors thank the Swiss Center for Conflict Research, Management and Resolution for its support.

In recent years, such diverse abusive behaviors have been manifesting with increased frequency and levels of intensity, e.g., [9]. Despite social media's efforts to combat online abusive behaviors [23, 33] this problem is still apparent. In fact, up to now, they have entered an arms race with the perpetrators, who constantly change tactics to evade the detection algorithms deployed by these platforms. Such algorithms, not disclosed to the public for obvious reasons, are typically custom-designed and tuned to detect only one specific type of abusive behavior, but usually miss other related behaviors. In the present paper, we study this complex problem by following a more holistic approach, which considers the various aspects of abusive behavior. We focus on Twitter, due to its popularity, and analyze user and textual properties from different angles of abusive posting behavior. We propose a deep learning architecture, which utilizes a wide variety of available metadata, and combines it with automatically-extracted hidden patterns within the text of the tweets, to detect multiple abusive behavioral norms which are highly inter-related. The proposed unified architecture is applied in a seamless and transparent fashion without the need for any change of the architecture but only training a model for each task (i.e., different types of abusive behavior). We test the proposed approach with multiple datasets addressing different abusive behaviors on Twitter. Our results demonstrate high performance across all datasets, with the AUC value to range from 92% to 98%. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Abusive Behavior; Deep Learning; Hate Speech; Twitter","Social networking (online); Abusive Behavior; Detection algorithm; Learning architectures; Multiple data sets; Offensive languages; Online social medias; Twitter; Unified architecture; Deep learning","","","","","","","Taofeek Aroyehun S., Gelbukh A., Aggression detection in social media: Using deep neural networks, data augmentation, and pseudo labeling, Proceedings of TRAC-2018, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, 26th ACM WWW Companion, (2017); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, (2014); Blackburn J., Kwak H., STFU NOOB!: Predicting Crowdsourced Decisions on Toxic Behavior in Online Games, (2014); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Cyber hate speech on twitter: An application of machine classification and statistical modeling for policy and decision making, Policy & Internet, 7, 2, pp. 223-242, (2015); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., De Cristofaro E., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Mean birds: Detecting aggression and bullying on twitter, 9th ACM WebScience, (2017); Chen Y., Zhou Y., Zhu S., Xu H., Detecting offensive language in social media to protect adolescent online safety, IEEE PASSAT & SocialCom, (2012); Clarke I., Grieve J., Dimensions of abusive language on twitter, Proceedings of the First Workshop on Abusive Language Online, (2017); Cook S., Cyberbullying Facts and Statistics for 2016-2018, (2018); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, ICWSM, (2017); Dinakar K., Reichart R., Lieberman H., Modeling the detection of Textual Cyberbullying, The Social Mobile Web, 11, 2, (2011); Djuric N., Zhou J., Morris R., Grbovic M., Radosavljevic V., Bhamidipati N., Hate speech detection with comment embeddings, 24th ACM WWW, (2015); Fortuna P., Bonavita I., Nunes S., Merging Datasets for Hate Speech Classification in Italian.

Although this alarming phenomenon has triggered many studies both from computational linguistic and machine learning points of view, less effort has been spent to analyze if those misogyny detection models are affected by an unintended bias. This can lead the models to associate unreasonably high misogynous scores to a non-misogynous text only because it contains certain terms, called identity terms. This work is the first attempt to address the problem of measuring and mitigating unintended bias in machine learning models trained for the misogyny detection task. We propose a novel synthetic test set that can be used as evaluation framework for measuring the unintended bias and different mitigation strategies specific for this task. Moreover, we provide a misogyny detection model that demonstrate to obtain the best classification performance in the state-of-the-art. Experimental results on recently introduced bias metrics confirm the ability of the bias mitigation treatment to reduce the unintended bias of the proposed misogyny detection model. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Bias measuring; Bias mitigation; Deep learning; Misogyny detection","Classification (of information); Machine learning; Bias measuring; Bias mitigation; Classification performance; Detection models; Evaluation framework; Machine learning models; Mitigation strategy; Online environments; Deep learning","","","","","","","Abadi M., Agarwal A., Barham P., Brevdo E., Chen Z., Citro C., Corrado G.S., Davis A., Dean J., Devin M., Ghemawat S.-J., Goodfellow I., Harp A., Irving G., Isard M., Jia Y., Jozefowicz R., Kaiser L., Kudlur M., Levenberg J., Mane D., Monga R., Moore S., Murray D., Olah C., Schuster M., Shlens J., Steiner B., Sutskever I., Talwar K., Tucker P., Vanhoucke V., Vasudevan V., Viegas F., Vinyals O., Warden P., Wattenberg M., Wicke M., Yu Y., Zheng X., TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, (2015); Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB 2018) (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), 10859, pp. 57-64, (2018); Basile A., Rubagotti C., Crotonemilano for AMI at evalita2018.

Due to the amount of content created on these platforms, spotting hate comments individually becomes an impossible task, and automatic hate speech detectors take place on those tasks. Furthermore, identifying hate speech towards women is specially complex due to the cultural background and the subtlety that characterizes it, which makes it interesting to consider it as a phenomenon by itself, differentiating it from traditional hate speech. Our contribution to automatic misogyny identification entails the creation of a machine-learning model based on linguistic and morphological features, applied to the training set of corpus developed at the Automatic Misogyny Evaluation task which contains 3307 tweets written in Spanish.

We participate in the shared task on Automatic Misogyny Identification (AMI) and Hate Speech Detection (HaSpeeDe 2) at the 7th evaluation campaign EVALITA 2020. For HaSpeeDe 2, we participate in Task A - Hate Speech Detection and submitted two-run results for the news headline test and tweets headline test, respectively. Our submitted run is based on the pre-trained multi-language model XLM-RoBERTa, and input into Convolution Neural Network and K-max Pooling (CNN + K-max Pooling). Then, an Ordered Neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM) is added to the previous representation and submitted to a linear decision function. Regarding the AMI shared task for the automatic identification of misogynous content in the Italian language. We participate in subtask A about Misogyny & Aggressive Behaviour Identification. Our system is similar to the one defined for HaSpeeDe and is based on the pre-trained multi-language model XLM-RoBERTa, an Ordered Neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM), a Capsule Network, and a final classifier.

This paper focused on hate speech racism and sexism and built a refined classifier that detects racist and sexist comments from the tweets. Investigating accessible data from Internet-based existence may produce interesting findings and bits of information about virtually every object, organization, or individual inside the universe of general feelings. Opinion mining is the statistical action behavior of suppositions, notions, and subjectivity of content from a corpus that integrates natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to classify a range of emotions. As such, sentiment analysis remains a widely researched and ever-evolving topic in the field of NLP. XGBoost with word2vec gave us the most promising results, so we refined it further by fine-tuning. Furthermore, we observed that the F1 score was 0.690285. Thus, we were able to reach an accuracy of 69% in our classifier. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Logistic regression (LR); Machine learning (ML); Random forest (RF); Sentiment analysis; Support vector machine (SVM); Xgboost","","","","","","","","Jahanbakhsh K., Moon Y., The Predictive Power of Social Media: On the Predictability of U.S Presidential Elections Using Twitter 36, (2014); Go A., Bhayani R., Huang L., Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision, CS224N Project Report, (2009); Agarwal A., Xie B., Vovsha I., Rambow O., Passonneau R., Twitter sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques 289, Proceedings of ACL 2011 Workshop on Languages in Social Media, pp. 30-38, (2011); Liu B., Sentiment analysis and subjectivity, Handbook of Natural Language Processing, (2010); Pak A., Paroubek P., Twitter as a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

However, there still exists a notable gap in STEM education participation according to gender. This quantitative research work aims to know the attitudes towards gender equality and coeducation shown by Compulsory Secondary Education students (grades 7 to 10). The sample was composed by 335 students aged 12-16 from three different secondary education schools located in the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León. In order to gather data on student attitudes towards gender, we applied an anonymous questionnaire using a valid and reliable instrument. The descriptive and inferential analysis results show relatively low levels of sexist attitudes among the students participating in the study, although some differences can be found according to the gender of the respondent. Generally, women hold attitudes that are more positive towards gender equality than those held by men. The discussion and conclusions address the need to continue this research line on factors related to gender issues, as well as to implement interventions based on the principles of coeducation, so that our education system, and thus our society, come closer to a real gender equality, thus improving the chances of women to undertake all kinds of studies and jobs. © 2020 ACM.","attitudes; coeducation; Gender equality; gender roles; gender stereotypes; sexism; teenagers","Ecosystems; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Education systems; Gender equality; Gender issues; Gender roles; Quantitative research; STEM education; Student attitudes; Students","","","","","","","Varela N., Feminismo Para Principiantes, (2013); Cabeza Leiva A., Importancia De La coeducación en los centros educativos, Pedagogía Magna, 8, pp. 39-45, (2010); Amurrio M., Larrinaga A., Usategui E., Del Valle A.I., Los estereotipos de género en los/las jóvenes y adolescentes.

Most such studies are addressing the perception of sexist content in games and the attitude in gaming communities. This article analyses the digital game Behind Every Great One, which portraits benevolent sexism, i.e. sexism that may appear positive but that has a damaging effect. What is unique with this game is that it is played from the victim's perspective, a housewife. The article presents an inductive analysis of the game using a triangulation of three different methods: a textual analysis, a player study, and an interview with the developer. The result shows that the game manages to convey benevolent sexism to players and evoke empathy for the victim. This is achieved through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and visual and musical aesthetics. For example, the physical space available for the protagonist is constantly shrinking and crying is used as a powerful mechanics in the game. The player needs to find an empty space for the protagonist to cry and this provides insight into her emotional state. Through the game, the developer reflects upon his own behaviour towards women and the consequences it might have had for them. In particular how his, and other men's, self-absorption forces their female partners into an undesirable social role, in which their needs are constantly neglected. The combination of a meaningful gameplay and the use of game mechanics to convey a message lead us to suggest that the gameplay can be characterized as a persuasive meaningful play. The game has a potential to be used in educational environments as a starting point for discussions regarding gender roles and benevolent sexism. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

One of the most frequently targeted groups comprise women, as misogyny is, unfortunately, a reality in our society. However, although great efforts have recently been made to identify misogyny, it is still difficult to distinguish as it can sometimes be very subtle and deep, signifying that the use of statistical approaches is not sufficient. Moreover, as Spanish is spoken worldwide, context and cultural differences can complicate this identification. Our contribution to the detection of misogyny in Spanish is two-fold. On the one hand, we apply Sentiment Analysis and Social Computing technologies for detecting misogynous messages in Twitter. On the other, we have compiled the Spanish MisoCorpus-2020, a balanced corpus regarding misogyny in Spanish, and classified it into three subsets concerning (1) violence towards relevant women, (2) messages harassing women in Spanish from Spain and Spanish from Latin America, and (3) general traits related to misogyny. Our proposal combines a classification based on average word embeddings and linguistic features in order to understand which linguistic phenomena principally contribute to the identification of misogyny. We have evaluated our proposal with three machine-learning classifiers, achieving the best accuracy of 85.175%. Finally the proposed approach is also validated with existing corpora for misogyny and aggressiveness detection such as AMI and HatEval obtaining good results © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Machine-learning; Misogyny detection; Natural language processing; Text classification","Classification (of information); Embeddings; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Cultural difference; Latin America; Linguistic features; Linguistic phenomena; On-line social networks; Social computing technologies; Social distance; Statistical approach; Linguistics","","","","","Banco Santander and University of Murcia, Spain; FEDER/ERDF; Spanish National Research Agency; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER, (KBS4FIA, PID2019-107652RB-I00, TIN2016-76323-R); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","Funding text 1: This work has been supported by the Spanish National Research Agency (AEI) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER/ERDF) through projects KBS4FIA (TIN2016-76323-R) and LaTe4PSP (PID2019-107652RB-I00) .

This study delves into the unexplored area of the relationship between rap music, politics, and the Internet audience in Russia. It focuses on the analysis of the production of the most popular rap videos—their narratives, power relations, and socio-political themes, as well as the prevailing patterns in the discussion on socio-political issues by the YouTube audience. The study brings three contributions that identify the power relations in the Russian society that manifest in the field of rap music. First, the Russian-speaking users demonstrate a high level of criticality toward the pro-Kremlin rap music on YouTube and challenge the lies of propaganda rap. Second, pro-government rappers follow the Soviet authoritarian ethos and praise belonging to the collective of elites, while liberal ones adhere to the individual responsibility. Third, we demonstrate the prevalence of patriarchal gender values, including macho politics and unquestioned sexism, which are representative of gender politics in the country. This article proves the importance of socio-political commentary on YouTube and points to the rap videos as the popular hubs for the socio-political debates. Users flow to rap videos and utilize the comment section to have their say on the political context and power relations rather than the music, to engage with others, and to contribute to the emerging collective debate. The comment sections on these rap videos have a unique value for the Russian users who exploit them as the negotiation space in the void of other platforms for social dialogue in Russia. © The Author(s) 2019.","censorship; gender; media; Pussy Riot; racism; rap music; Russia; Russian politics; YouTube","","","","","","Quint Hogg Trust","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author(s) received financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article from Quint Hogg Trust.","Why Pussy Riot is big in America, but not Russia, Vulture., (2012); Adams T.M., Fuller D.B., The words have changed but the ideology remains the same: Misogynistic lyrics in rap music, Journal of Black Studies, 36, pp. 938-957, (2006); U Timati Poyavitsya Svoj Sobstvennyj Futbolnyj Klub, (2017); Amos H., The Bell: Meet the Russian media start-up fighting for the precarious future of independent media, The Calvert Journal., (2018); Aro J., The cyberspace war: Propaganda and trolling as warfare tools, European View, 15, pp. 121-132, (2016); Balandina A., Rap music as a cultural mediator in postconflict Yugoslavia, Hip Hop at Europe’s Edge: Music, Agency, and Social Change, pp. 63-82, (2017); Russian protesters mobilize via social networks, as key opposition leaders jailed, Radiofreeeurope/Radioliberty., (2011); Bodrunova S., Litvinenko A., Fragmentation of society and media hybridisation in today’s Russia: How Facebook voices collective demands, Zhurnal Issledovanii Sotsialnoi Politiki/The Journal of Social Policy Studies, 14, pp. 113-124, (2016); Woman Suffrage; Chang J., Can’t Stop, won’t Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation, (2007); Clark K., Petersburg: Crucible of Cultural Revolution, (1996); Cushman T., SUNY Series in the Sociology of Culture: Notes from Underground: Rock Music Counterculture in Russia, (1995); Davydova Y., The Russian Rapper from the UK Suburbs Who Studied at Oxford, (2016); Denisova A., Democracy, protest and public sphere in Russia after the 2011-2012 anti-government protests: Digital media at stake, Media, Culture & Society, 39, pp. 976-994, (2017); Denisova A., The first rule of fight club: Or 3 reasons why rap battles are a (political) viral hit in Russia, <ref-sourcetitle></ref-sourcetitle>, (2017); Dyer O., Vaccine safety: Russian bots and trolls stoked online debate, research finds, BMJ, 362, (2018); Edgar A., Commenting straight from the underground: N.W.A., police brutality, and YouTube as a space for neoliberal resistance, Southern Communication Journal, 81, pp. 223-236, (2016); Ewell P., Russian rap in the era of Vladimir Putin, Hip Hop at Europe’s Edge: Music, Agency, and Social Change, pp. 45-63, (2017); Fairclough N., Critical Discourse Analysis: The Critical Study of Language, (1997); Fairclough N., Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research, (2003); Filer T., Fredheim R., Sparking debate?

The process and resources that compose the framework are discussed based on a case study exploring everyday sexism. The framework design has been supported by participatory activities and a trial, suggesting the adequacy of the methods and resources in engaging diverse participants with both the educational game design and the social issue. It is expected that the design process introduced here will boost the potential of game jams as a space for learning, collaboration and critical thinking. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, sexism as a form of discrimination towards women spread exponentially through the web and at a very high frequency, especially in the form of memes. Memes, which are typically composed of pictorial and textual components, can convey messages ranging from women stereotype, shaming, objectification to violence. In order to counterattack this phenomenon, in this paper we give a first insight in the field of automatic detection of sexist memes, by investigating both unimodal and multimodal approaches to understand the contribution of textual and visual cues. © 2019 IEEE.","Cybersexism; Early Fusion vs Late Fusion; Meme; Unimodal vs Multimodal","Computer programming; Computer science; Automatic Detection; Cybersexism; Late fusion; Meme; Multi-modal; Multi-modal approach; Very high frequency; Women stereotypes; Intelligent computing","","","","","Nvidia","We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Tesla K40 GPU used for this research.

It would be useful to discover the hidden relationships between gender harassment and certain beliefs about women as travellers, tourism professionals and sex objects in the field of hospitality. Methodologically, a survey was carried out reaching a sample of ±684 units by means of a convenience sampling procedure. The measuring instruments consisted of a structured questionnaire divided into two kinds of Likert beliefs scales comprising general statements and statements related to tourism. The survey respondent data were also gathered as regards sociodemographic characteristics. This paper presents empirical evidence to identify the causal factors of gender violence by considering general and particular stereotyping in tourism. Firstly, by performing three exploratory factor analyses, three female stereotyping dimensions were labelled in the field of tourism (occupational sexism, ambivalent sexist discrimination, and sex as a commodity), as well as three general prejudices about women (dysfunctional romantic relationships, ethically challenged presumptions, and aesthetical manners conventions) and the gender harassment factor. Secondly, a linear regression analysis was carried out to demonstrate that both general stereotyping related to a broader “life” framework and sectorial prejudices in tourism cause gender harassment. Finally, this research proves that general stereotyping determines sectorial prejudices in the field of tourism. The practical implications could be to enhance gender equality and combat gender harassment by revealing unintentional and unobserved prejudices that occur in a general life setting and in the tourism sphere against women as neglected professionals, under the subtle and ambivalent condition of travellers, and even as objects of consumption. © 2020 by the authors.

There are numerous studies regarding curriculum integration. However, there is insufficient research that offers insight into how different forms of disciplinary thought may come together in the design and development in practice for an educational purpose. The research professors carried out a qualitative investigation, working with two pre-service teacher groups from the fields of mathematics and social sciences. We used a validated research instrument to analyze how interdisciplinary educational proposals are developed, and how said proposals can be used to understand our social reality. Through an integrated project, pre-service teachers addressed sexist hate speech taken from different contexts. They designed didactic proposals, with mathematical contents, which allow high school students to argue with data and create counter-narratives, which softened or eliminated the sexist hate speech Among the conclusions, we may emphasize the value of pre-service teachers identifying their strengths in order to use the mathematical and social thought processes in an autonomous and creative way, thereby developing the instrumental, functional, and formative character in mathematics education. © 2020 by the authors.

How is the hegemony of North America, Eurocentrism, anti-Blackness and sexism implicated in this? We consider such questions in relation to Black women's media and aesthetic practices, and their related scholarship, by examining the Ghana-based web series An African City. Our work echoes calls for the decentering of media and communication studies rooted in white and Western perspectives but positioned as “universal.” We explore Black women's experiences (in Britain, the United States, Ghana, and Nigeria) as active producers in their communities; beyond the dominant epistemological hierarchy of whiteness in contrast with Blackness. Framing visual communication as a community-based source of self-expression, we emphasize the liberatory possibilities of aesthetics (fashion and screen depictions) for Black women, while tarrying with how capitalism constrains such radical potential. © The Author(s) 2020.

Since that population change appears in recent 10 years, formerly male-oriented gaming community has confronted gender issues. In this paper, we witness that a strong gender stereotype exists for both genders in Korea by two surveys. In the first survey, subjects show that they have different expectations of opposite gender‟s favorable game style where both genders have exactly same favorite styles. In the second survey, we investigate how members of hostile sexism community groups choose teammates in Overwatch game if they have privilege to select teammates for specific roles. Ilbe and Womad as two far extreme misogyny and misandry groups show hostile sexism in teammate selection. The result implies that hostile sexism and gender stereotype shown in game playing may be induced from other social factors than the amount of the game playing experiences.

Most such studies are addressing the perception of sexist content in games and the attitude in gaming communities. This article analyses the digital game Behind Every Great One, which portraits benevolent sexism, i.e. sexism that may appear positive but that has a damaging effect. What is unique with this game is that it is played from the victim's perspective, a housewife. The article presents an inductive analysis of the game using a triangulation of three different methods: a textual analysis, a player study, and an interview with the developer. The result shows that the game manages to convey benevolent sexism to players and evoke empathy for the victim. This is achieved through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and visual and musical aesthetics. For example, the physical space available for the protagonist is constantly shrinking and crying is used as a powerful mechanics in the game. The player needs to find an empty space for the protagonist to cry and this provides insight into her emotional state. Through the game, the developer reflects upon his own behaviour towards women and the consequences it might have had for them. In particular how his, and other men's, self-absorption forces their female partners into an undesirable social role, in which their needs are constantly neglected. The combination of a meaningful gameplay and the use of game mechanics to convey a message lead us to suggest that the gameplay can be characterized as a persuasive meaningful play.

In the male-dominated sphere of esports, the underrepresentation of women and nonbinary people often leaves these marginalized groups invisible, with a significant lack of women and nonbinary people competing in top-tier tournaments. We highlight the experience of Wang ‘BaiZe’ Xinyu, a Chinese Hearthstone player who became the first woman to compete in a Hearthstone Championship Tour event in the game’s 3-year history. The narrative surrounding BaiZe’s participation largely focused on her gender and ignored the achievements that led her to qualify for the event. We argue that BaiZe’s entrance to the championship scene was received negatively by both competitors and spectators, reinforcing barriers that exclude women and nonbinary people from entering this male-dominated space. The discrimination faced by these esports competitors reinforces sexism inherent not only in Hearthstone but also in esports in general. © The Author(s) 2019.","competitive gaming; esports; gender; gender in games; Hearthstone","","","","","","","","(2016); Anable A., Casual games, time management, and the work of affect, Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, (2013); Hearthstone grandmasters is almost here!

Analyzing hateful speech in social media is essential for understanding, fighting and discouraging such actions. We believe that by extracting fragments of text that are semantically similar it is possible to depict recurrent linguistic patterns in certain kinds of discourse. Therefore, we aim to use these patterns to encapsulate frequent statements textually expressed in microblog posts. In this paper, we propose to exploit such linguistic patterns in the context of hate speech. Through a technique that we call SSP (Short Semantic Pattern) mining, we are able to extract sequences of words that share a similar meaning in their word embedding representation. By analyzing the extracted patterns, we reveal some kinds of discourses that are replayed across a dataset, such as racist and sexist statements. Afterwards, we experiment using SSP as features to build classifiers that detect if a tweet contains hate speech (binary classification) and to distinguish between sexist, racist and clean tweets (ternary classification). The SSP instances encountered in tweets containing sexism have shown that a large number of sexist tweets began with the introduction 'I'm not sexist but' and 'Call me sexist but'. Meanwhile, SSP instances found in tweets reproducing racism revealed a prominence of contents against the Islamic religion, associated entities and organizations. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","hate speech; linguistic pattern; Natural language processing; word embeddings","Semantics; Social networking (online); Speech; Binary classification; Content analysis; Linguistic patterns; Micro-blog; Semantic pattern; Social media; Classification (of information)","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","This work was partially supported by the Coordenacão de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ńıvel Superior (CAPES), through MSc and PhD studentship grants.","Watanabe H., Bouazizi M., Ohtsuki T., Hate speech on twitter: A pragmatic approach to collect hateful and offensive expressions and perform hate speech detection, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 13825-13835, (2018); Kettrey H.H., Laster W.N., Staking territory in the ""world white web"" an exploration of the roles of overt and color-blind racism in maintaining racial boundaries on a popular web site, Social Currents, 1, 3, pp. 257-274, (2014); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people?

This research sought to integrate two separate but complimentary lines of research (the well-being effects of activism and social identity) by suggesting that online activism may enhance the ability of social identity to protect against the negative well-being consequences of pervasive discrimination. Three studies, each with different operational definitions of online activism, showed a similar pattern: online activism enhanced the relationship between gender identity and well-being. Consistent with theory on activism's role as a dynamic predictor of social identity (e.g., Drury & Reicher, 1999), this research suggests that online activism, as a means by which social identity can be enacted, can strengthen the protective ability of social identity for well-being. Theoretical and practical implications of the benefits of online activism are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Gender discrimination; Identity; Online activism; Well-being","Human computer interaction; Gender discrimination; Identity; Online activism; Operational definition; Positive feelings; Protective properties; Similar pattern; Well being; article; female; gender identity; male; sexism; social status; theoretical study; wellbeing; Behavioral research","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (410-2005-0256)","This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number ( 410-2005-0256 )].

Furthermore, a large amount of users generating publications on online media like Twitter contributes to the hardness of controlling sexism and sexual harassment content, requesting robust methods of Machine Learning (ML) to be applied in this task. To do so, this work aims at comparing the performance of supervised ML algorithms to categorize online harassment in Twitter posts. We tested Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear SVM, Gaussian SVM, Polynomial SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and AdaBoost methods on the SIMAH Competition benchmark data, using TF-IDF vectors and Word2Vec embeddings as features. As results, we reached scores above 0.80% of accuracy for all the harassment types in the data. We also showed that, when using TF-IDF vectors, Linear and Gaussian SVM are the best methods to predict harassment content, while Decision Trees and Random Forest better categorize physical and sexual harassment. Overall, by using TF-IDF vectors presented higher performance on these data, suggesting that the training corpus for Word2Vec influenced negatively on the classification task outcomes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Online harassment; Text classification; Twitter","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Forestry; Gaussian distribution; Logistic regression; Polynomial regression; Random forests; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Benchmark data; Classification tasks; Ml algorithms; Multi layer perceptron; Robust methods; Sexual harassment; Training corpus; Virtual spaces; Learning systems","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2018/09465-0); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Dalhousie University","Supported by the organization of ECML PKDD 2019.","Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, (2017); Boser B.E., Guyon I.M., Vapnik V.N., pp. 144-152; Breiman L., Random forests, Mach.

In this sense, pertinent questions arise in seeking to comprehend contemporary phenomena and, consequently, leave room for disputable formulations, especially in areas of which science and technology have little understanding. This article offers a bibliographical essay that aims to begin the path to include black women in computing and technology, in a social background of sexism and racial segregation. Furthermore, it presents a summary of the resistance strategies used in black women’s course in this area by analyzing the elements of black identity strengthened by these initiatives in Brazil and abroad. © 2019 Latin American Center for Informatics Studies.

Our methods include topic modelling using nonnegative matrix factorization, and analyzing user commenting activity. Our analysis leads to three main findings. First, gendered forums discuss workplace sexism, personal safety, rape, and legal issues among other gender issues, and different forums have different perspectives on these issues. Second, users commenting on r/MensRights are similar to users who are politically right leaning and associated with sexist or racist content, whereas users commenting on r/Feminism are similar to those who support minorities, body acceptance, and survivors of sexual assault. Third, users commenting on r/TheRedPill are similar to those who do not believe in the equality of race or gender. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its author(s).","","Factorization; Gender issues; Legal issues; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Personal safety; Sexual assault; Matrix algebra","","","","","","","Allan J.A., Phallic affect, or why men's rights activists have feelings, Men and Masculinities, 19, 1, pp. 22-41, (2016); Aronson A.B., Et al., Men and Masculinities: AJ, 1, (2004); Baziotis C., Pelekis N., Doulkeridis C., Datastories at semeval-2017 task 4: Deep lstm with attention for message-level and topicbased sentiment analysis, Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pp. 747-754, (2017); Berman J., Men's Rights Groups Go Mainstream, (2009); Berman J., Men's Rights Groups Go Mainstream, (2015); Berry S., Feminists Rage over Trump Admin Push for Due Process in Campus Sexual Misconduct Allegations, (2018); Blanchard A., Understanding and customizing stopword lists for enhanced patent mapping, World Patent Information, 29, 4, pp. 308-316, (2007); Chamberlain P., The Feminist Fourth Wave: Affective Temporality, (2017); Connell R.W., Change among the gatekeepers: Men, masculinities, and gender equality in the global arena, Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 30, 3, pp. 1801-1825, (2005); Consalvo M., Confronting toxic gamer culture: A challenge for feminist game studies scholars, Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, 1, 1, pp. 1-6, (2012); Crenshaw K., Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: A black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory and antiracist politics, U.

The predictive weight of these variables in relation to cyber dating violence perpetration (cyber-control and cyber-aggression) was also analyzed. Of an initial sample of 919 adolescents, who had or had had a dating relationship in the past 12 months, 492 adolescents were included in this study (M age = 15.10, SD = 1.59). The results revealed a higher prevalence of cyber-control behaviors and a different predictive weight of the analyzed variables in relation to cyber-control and cyber-aggression for boys and girls. Physical and relational offline dating violence were significant predictors of cyber-aggression for boys, while sexist attitudes and romantic myths were the main predictors for girls. Hostile sexism and relational offline dating violence were positive predictors of cyber-control for boys, while romantic myths and verbal-emotional offline dating violence were the main predictors of cyber-control for girls. These results highlight the need for gender analyses in cyber dating violence research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescents; Cyber dating violence; Gender analysis; Offline dating violence; Romantic myths;

As, Tandil, Argentina","Although hate speech detection has been extensively tackled in the literature as a classification task, recent works have raised concerns about the robustness of such systems. Understanding hate speech remains a significant challenge for creating reliable datasets and automatizing its detection. An essential goal for detection techniques is to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of offense. For example, ensuring that models are not reproducing common biases in society associating certain terms with hateful content. This situation is known as unintended bias, in which models learn usual associations between words (commonly called identity terms) which causes them to classify content as hateful just because it contains one identity word. In this work, we tackle the issue of measuring and explaining the sensitivity of models to the presence of identity terms during model training. To this end, focusing on a misogyny detection task, we study how models behave in the presence of the identified terms, and whether they contribute to biasing the performance of trained models. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

With word representations ubiquitously used in NLP models and pipelines, this raises ethical issues and jeopardizes the fairness of language technologies. While there exists a large body of work on bias measures and debiasing methods, to date, there is no platform that would unify these research efforts and make bias measuring and debiasing of representation spaces widely accessible. In this work, we present DEBIE, the first integrated platform for (1) measuring and (2) mitigating bias in word embeddings. Given an (i) embedding space (users can choose between the predefined spaces or upload their own) and (ii) a bias specification (users can choose between existing bias specifications or create their own), DEBIE can (1) compute several measures of implicit and explicit bias and modify the embedding space by executing two (mutually composable) debiasing models. DEBIE's functionality can be accessed through four different interfaces: (a) a web application, (b) a desktop application, (c) a REST-ful API, and (d) as a command-line application. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Application programming interfaces (API); Computational linguistics; Embeddings; Natural language processing systems; Specifications; Desktop applications; Integrated platform; Language technology; Recent researches; Representation space; Research efforts; WEB application; Word representations; Vector spaces","","","","","Eliteprogramm of the Baden-Württemberg Stiftung","Anne Lauscher and Goran Glavasˇ are supported by the Eliteprogramm of the Baden-Württemberg Stiftung (AGREE grant).

Using the case studies of r/TheRedPill and r/Braincels, the paper argues the quarantine successfully cordoned off affected subreddits and associated hateful material from the rest of the platform. It did not, however, reduce the levels of hateful material within the affected spaces. Instead many users reacted by leaving Reddit for less regulated spaces, with Reddit making this hateful material someone else’s problem.

Using a framework of intersectionality to understand how the concept of marginality is deployed within this area is important for understanding how power is exerted. Recent outspoken misogyny has brought to the surface some of the underlying gender inequality within games cultures but also points to areas that researchers in the field need to be alive to in their own work. © The Author(s) 2017.","feminism; games culture; games studies; intersectionality; reflexivity","","","","","","","","Balsamo A., Technologies of the gendered body: Reading cyborg women, (1996); Banet-Weiser S., Miltner K., #MasculinitySoFragile: Culture, structure, and networked misogyny, Feminist Media Studies, 16, pp. 171-174, (2016); Braithwaite A., It’s about ethics in games journalism?

Implicit bias refers to the unconscious associations and stereotypes an individual ascribes based on affiliation with a particular identity that impacts attitudes, actions, and behaviors. Though individuals may hold egalitarian views, they can still act in ways that reflect an implicit bias that is incongruent with their greater beliefs and/or intentions. While literature and tests on implicit bias exist, to our knowledge, a method to specifically gauge biases that exist in the perceptions and dynamics relating to engineering environments, more directly, does not. This study introduces a novel mixed-methods approach that incorporates biometric testing to gain insight and evidence into the biases that may exist among faculty and students engaging in engineering environments. Specifically, informed by literature on microaggressions and implicit bias, an eye-tracking paradigm is used to draw evidence on existing biases related to sexism, ageism, racism, ableism, and classism. In this study, when prompted, participants are asked to select from a pool of options based on the information presented in a specific scenario. During this selection, the participant's eye movements, specifically their fixation regions and times, are collected to later correlate with their chosen selections. Preliminary findings from this study found individual specific implicit biases to exist. The insights of this work could complement efforts to create awareness of bias for impacting the adoption of attitudes and behaviors more conducive to the cultivation of inclusive environments. © CoNECD 2019.All right reserved.","Engineering; Eye-tracking; Faculty; Graduate; Undergraduate","Eye movements; Biometric testing; Engineering environment; Gain insight; Mixed method; Eye tracking","","","","","","","Chubin D., May G., Babco E., Diversifying the Engineering Workforce, Journal of Engineering Education, 94, 1, pp. 73-86, (2005); May G., Chubin D., A Retrospective on Undergraduate Engineering Success for Underrepresented Minority Students, Journal of Engineering Education, 92, 1, pp. 27-39, (2003); of Engineering R.

Such harassment ranges from online threats and hacking to doxxing and organized campaigns to discredit one's work. It has now become an often-unrecognized part of the job for academics—particularly socially marginalized academics and those who study controversial topics such as race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality—to work to protect themselves from such attacks. With this increase in intimidation attempts, new questions for the profession arise regarding what skills we should be instilling in trainees, whether professional association and academic units should be taking explicit positions or action on researcher/faculty harassment, and the obligations of our employers with regard to defending faculty, staff, and students. This panel will describe targeted online harassment of academics, discuss models for individual and institutional response, and raise questions for the profession as a whole. Sponsored by SIG ED.

Gender-incongruent responses to recent events like #gamergate implies that the gender of the participant is not paramount to experience, but that their beliefs about gender roles are. To explore the role of sexist beliefs on experience in sexist games, we created three versions of a game that were identical except for the presence of sexist imagery and/or dialogue. We show that enjoyment of sexist games is not predicted by player gender, but by the player's preexisting beliefs about gender. Furthermore, avatar identification is the pathway through which enjoyment is facilitated. Finally, sexist dialogue does not improve the play experience for anyone - rather it harms experience for players of all genders who do not hold sexist beliefs. © 2017 ACM.","#gamergate; Digital games; Play experience; Sexism","Computer games; Human engineering; #gamergate; Avatar identifications; Digital games; Gender roles; Play experience; Sexism; Interactive computer graphics","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","We thank our participants, the Interaction Lab for support, and NSERC SWaGUR for funding.","Behm-Morawitz E., Mastro D., The effects of the sexualization of female video game characters on gender stereotyping and female self-concept, Sex Roles, 61, 11-12, pp. 808-823, (2009); Bilandzic H., Busselle R.W., Transportation and transportability in the cultivation of genre-consistent attitudes and estimates, Journal of Communication, 58, 3, pp. 508-529, (2008); Bilandzic H., Busselle R.W., Enjoyment of films as a function of narrative experience, perceived realism and transportability, Communications, 36, (2011); Birk M., Mandryk R.L., Control your game-self, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '13, (2013); Birk M.V., Toker D., Mandryk R.L., Conati C., Modeling motivation in a social network game using player-centric traits and personality traits, Lecture Notes in Computer Science User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization, pp. 18-30, (2015); Birk M.V., Atkins C., Bowey J.T., Mandryk R.L., Fostering intrinsic motivation through avatar identification in digital games, Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '16, (2016); Blee K.M., Jackman M.R., The velvet glove: Paternalism and conflict in gender, class, and race relations, Contemporary Sociology, 23, 6, (1994); Blog Death Threats Spark Debate; Bloomfield J., #GamerGate is Fundamentally a Fight for Men, for Masculinity and for Male Spaces, (2015); Bowey J.T., Birk M.V., Mandryk R.L., Manipulating leaderboards to induce player experience, Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play - CHI PLAY '15, (2015); Burgess M.C.R., Stermer S.P., Burgess S.R., Sex, lies, and video games: The portrayal of male and female characters on video game covers, Sex Roles, 57, 5-6, pp. 419-433, (2007); Butler J., Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, (1990); Cassell J., Jenkins H., Chess for girls?

The students consider how brands can often exploit the society's insecurities and desires, selling them products, services, and ideas that they don't need or shouldn't accept. Mindful of the role that graphic designers play in the emergence of successful brands, the students create satirical brand identities for reprehensible companies of their own invention. This process makes use of the Culture Jamming process, which is 'the act of using existing mass media to comment on those very media themselves, using the original medium's communication method.' Recent parody projects have explored obesity, prescription drugs, gender issues, xenophobia, climate ignorance, body image, and misogyny in entertainment. This initiative provides a model for educators looking for ways to incorporate cultural criticism into an already tightly defined curriculum.","Branding; Cultural criticism; Curriculum; Parody","Curricula; Design; Branding; Communication method; Cultural criticism; Graphic designers; Parody; Personal experience; Prescription drugs; Self reflection; Students","","","","","","","","L.

Digital doppelgangers possess great potential to serve as powerful models for behavioral change. An emerging technology, the Rapid Avatar Capture and Simulation (RACAS) system, enables low-cost and high-speed scanning of a human user and creation of a digital doppelganger that is a fully animatable virtual 3D model of the user. We designed a virtual role-playing game, DELTA, that implements a powerful cognitive dissonance-based paradigm for attitudinal and behavioral change, and integrated it with digital doppelgangers to influence a human user’s attitude towards sexism on college campuses. In this paper, we discuss the design and evaluation the RACAS system and the DELTA game-based environment. Results indicate the potential impact of the DELTA game-based environment in creating an immersive virtual experience for attitudinal change. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cognitive dissonance; Digital doppelganger; Simulation game; Virtual role-play","Interactive computer graphics; Three dimensional computer graphics; Cognitive dissonance; Design and evaluations; Digital doppelganger; Emerging technologies; Game-based environments; High speed scanning; Simulation games; Virtual roles; Intelligent virtual agents","","","","","Army Research Laboratory, ARL; U.S. Navy","This work is supported by the US Army Research Laboratory.

The current research explored a number of factors and their impact upon stereotypical perceptions and attitudes toward female players. This included avatar gender, gender identity by gaming context, as well as more general gender-role beliefs. We undertook two studies, each utilizing an online questionnaire targeted toward online players. Study 1 recruited online gamers (N = 489) and compared competence perceptions of players, which varied by player gender (male, female) and avatar gender (male, female), whereby four conditions were established. Overall, player competence was perceived to be highest when male avatars were used, specifically when female players were depicted in this way. Study 2 explored the relationships between male social identity and gender-role beliefs, with sexist attitudes in gaming, and whether this varied by gaming context (massively multiplayer online [MMO] vs. first-person shooter [FPS]). Male online gamers (N = 193) were recruited, of which 112 were MMO players, and 81 were FPS players. It was found that identifying as male social identity was not related to sexist attitudes in either gaming context. However, more general gender-role beliefs were related to sexist attitudes. The findings indicate that although certain stereotypes exist (e.g., competence perceptions), these are not necessarily harvested by players' identities within communities, but may derive through more operational functions such as avatar gender. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","competence; context; digital games; gender; Gender swapping; sexism","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Internet; Male; Perception; Stereotyping; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult; adult; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; perception; questionnaire; sex role; sexism; social status; stereotypy; adolescent; attitude; gender identity; Internet; psychology; stereotyping; video game; young adult","","","","","","","Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry, (2016); Taylor N., Jenson J., De Castell S., Cheerleaders/booth babes/Halo hoes: Pro-gaming, gender and jobs for the boys, Digital Creativity, 20, pp. 239-252, (2009); Beasley B., Collins-Standley T., Shirts vs, Skins: Clothing As An Indicator of Gender Role Stereotyping in Video Games.

The classifier assigns each tweet to one of four predefined categories: racism, sexism, both (racism and sexism) and non-hate-speech. Four Convolutional Neural Network models were trained on resp. character 4-grams, word vectors based on semantic information built using word2vec, randomly generated word vectors, and word vectors combined with character n-grams. The feature set was down-sized in the networks by max-pooling, and a softmax function used to classify tweets. Tested by 10-fold cross-validation, the model based on word2vec embeddings performed best, with higher precision than recall, and a 78.3% F-score. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Convolution; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Text processing; 10-fold cross-validation; Convolutional neural network; Features sets; Max-pooling; Model-based OPC; N-grams; Neural network model; Semantics Information; Text classification systems; Word vectors; Deep learning","","","","","Czech Republic's Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; Czech Republic’s Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; NFR; Norway Financial Mechanism; European Environment Agency, EEA; Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Norges Forskningsråd","Funding text 1: The work reported here was carried out within the CZ09 Czech-Norwegian Research Programme under Project Contract 7F14047, HaBiT (“Harvesting big text data for under-resourced languages”; http://www.habit-project.eu) funded by the Research Council of Norway (NFR) and the Czech Republic's Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MŠMT) through the EEA/Norway Financial Mechanism.; Funding text 2: The work reported here was carried out within the CZ09 Czech-Norwegian Research Programme under Project Contract 7F14047, HaBiT (“Harvesting big text data for under-resourced languages”; http://www.habit-project.eu) funded by the Research Council of Norway (NFR) and the Czech Republic’s Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MŠMT) through the EEA/Norway Financial Mechanism.","Buckels Erin E., Trapnell Paul D., Paulhus Delroy L., Trolls just want to have fun, Personality and Individual Differences, 67, pp. 97-102, (2014); Gesetzentwurf der Fraktionen der CDU/CSU und SPD: Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Verbesserung der Rechtsdurchsetzung in sozialen Netzwerken (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz - NetzDG), (2017); Chen Ying, Zhou Yilu, Zhu Sencun, Xu Heng, Detecting offensive language in social media to protect adolescent online safety, Proceedings of the 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing and 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust, pp. 71-80, (2012); Collobert Ronan, Weston Jason, Bottou Leon, Karlen Michael, Kavukcuoglu Koray, Kuksa Pavel, Natural language processing (almost) from scratch, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 2493-2537, (2011); Davidson Thomas, Warmsley Dana, Macy Michael, Weber Ingmar, Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), (2017); Hate crime: abuse, hate and extremism online, (2017); Mikolov Tomas, Chen Kai, Corrado Greg, Dean Jeffrey, Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space, CoRR, (2013); Mikolov Tomas, Sutskever Ilya, Chen Kai, Corrado Greg, Dean Jeffrey, Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26 (NIPS 2013), pp. 3111-3119, (2013); Nakov Preslav, Ritter Alan, Rosenthal Sara, Sebastiani Fabrizio, Stoyanov Veselin, SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment analysis in Twitter, Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2016); Nielsen Nikolaj, EU states back bill against online hate speech, EUobserver, (2017); Nobata Chikashi, Tetreault Joel, Thomas Achint, Mehdad Yashar, Chang Yi, Abusive language detection in online user content, Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 145-153, (2016); Papegnies Etienne, Labatut Vincent, Dufour Richard, Linares Georges, Impact of content features for automatic online abuse detection, Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference, (2017); Ross Bjorn, Rist Michael, Carbonell Guillermo, Cabrera Benjamin, Kurowsky Nils, Wojatzki Michael, Measuring the reliability of hate speech annotations: The case of the European refugee crisis, 3rd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Computer-Mediated Communication, pp. 6-9, (2016); Sikdar Utpal Kumar, Gamback Bjorn, Named entity recognition for Amharic using stack-based deep learning, Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference, (2017); Sood Sara Owsley, Churchill Elizabeth F., Antin Judd, Automatic identification of personal insults on social news sites, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63, 2, pp. 270-285, (2012); Spertus Ellen, Smokey: Automatic recognition of hostile messages, Proceedings of the 14th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and 9th Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1058-1065, (1997); Thomasson Emma, German cabinet agrees to fine social media over hate speech, Reuters, (2017); Waseem Zeerak, Are you a racist or am i seeing things?

To understand whether this also cuts across racial lines, and furthermore, whether it differs from objectifying treatment of actual people, we conducted a preliminary mixed-methods investigation of online commentary on videos of three such robots - Bina48, Nadine, and YangYang - contrasted with commentary on videos of three women with similar identity cues. Analysis of the frequency and nature of abusive commentary suggests that: (1) the verbal abuse of the Bina48 and YangYang (two robots racialized as Black and Asian respectively) is laced with both subtle and overt racism; (2) people more readily engage in the verbal abuse of humanlike robots (versus other people). Not only do these findings reflect a concerning phenomenon, consideration is warranted as to whether peoples engagement in abusive interactions with humanlike robots could impact their subsequent interactions with other people. © 2018 Authors.","androids; human-robot interaction; humanlike robots; objectification; racism; robot abuse; sexism","Man machine systems; androids; Humanlike robots; objectification; racism; sexism; Human robot interaction","","","","","","","Brsci D., Kidokoro H., Suehiro Y., Kanda T., Escaping from children's abuse of social robots, Proceedings of HRI.

Integrating research on digital anonymity and cyberbullying, this paper analyzes the key features of Yik Yak and discusses the ethical dimensions of technology design, as illustrated by the Yik Yak case study. Based on this analysis and integrating previous research findings on interaction in digital spaces, we conclude by providing a set of guidelines for integrating ethical considerations into the process of designing social apps, and offer a few directions for further research in this area. © First Monday.","","","","","","","","","Aboujaoude E., Savage M.W., Starcevic V., Salame W.O., Cyberbullying: Review of an old problem gone viral,, Journal of Adolescent Health, 57, 1, pp. 10-18, (2015); Anderson T., Sturm B., Cyberbullying from playground to computer,, Young Adult Library Services, 5, 2, pp. 24-27, (2007); Baker M., ""Cyberbullying and the bystander: What promotes or inhibits adolescent participation?"", (2014); Barlett C.P., Anonymously hurting others online: The effect of anonymity on cyberbullying frequency,, Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 4, 2, pp. 70-79, (2015); Barlett C.P., Gentile D.A., Chew C., Predicting cyberbullying from anonymity,, Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 5, 2, pp. 171-180, (2016); Bernstein M.S., Monroy-Hernandez A., Harry D., Andre P., Panovich K., Vargas G., 4chan and/b/: An analysis of anonymity and ephemerality in a large online community,, Proceedings of the Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 50-57, (2011); Berson I.R., Berson M.J., Ferron J.M., Emerging risks of violence in the digital age: Lessons for educators from an online study of adolescent girls in the United States,, Journal of School Violence, 1, 2, pp. 51-71, (2007); Black E.W., Mezzina K., Thompson L.A., Anonymous social media-Understanding the content and context of Yik Yak,, Computers in Human Behavior, 57, pp. 17-22, (2016); Bowler L., Knobel C., Mattern E., From cyberbullying to well-being: A narrative-based participatory approach to values-oriented design for social media,, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 66, 6, pp. 1274-1293, (2015); boyd D., It's complicated: The social lives of networked teens, (2014); Brown W.N., ""Schools banning phone Yik Yak for promoting hate speech,"", (2015); Boczkowski P.J., Mutual shaping of users and technologies in a national virtual community,, Journal of Communication, 49, 2, pp. 86-108, (1999); Chang C., Internet safety survey: Who will protect the children?, Berkeley Technology Law Journal, 25, 1, pp. 501-527, (2010); Christie C., Dill E., Evaluating peers in cyberspace: The impact of anonymity,, Computers in Human Behavior, 55, pp. 292-299, (2016); Christopherson K.M., The positive and negative implications of anonymity in Internet social interactions: 'On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog',, Computers in Human Behavior, 23, 6, pp. 3038-3056, (2007); Constine J., ""Yik Yak's CTO drops out as the hyped anonymous app stagnates,"", (2016); Cover R., Digital identities: Creating and communicating the online self, (2015); Craig S.L., Mclnroy L., You can form a part of yourself online: The influence of new media on identity development and coming out for LGBTQ youth,, Journal of Gay & Lesbian Mental Health, 18, 1, pp. 95-109, (2014); DeAndrea D.C., Tom Tong S., Liang Y., Levine T.R., Walther J.B., When do people misrepresent themselves to others?

Women’s exclusion from the field often leads to the creation of software that reproduces sexist stereotypes and does not meet women’s needs. Previous studies address this issue and have motivated a participatory and interdisciplinary approach to software creation in order to avoid gender discrimination and sexism. From this perspective, I argue that implementing a Gender and Diversity Studies lens can broaden the development process of software. In this article, I demonstrate the benefits and challenges of such an approach by introducing a participatory project I conducted in the field of Music Information Retrieval from an interdisciplinary perspective: Computer Science, Music Psychology and Gender and Diversity Studies. I invited a group of 14 year old girls to participate in the study. The outcome demonstrates the need for both a participatory and interdisciplinary approach in order to cultivate gender-inclusive research and software development. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Computing; Embodiment; Gender studies; Music cognition; Participatory design","","","","","","","","Akrich M., User Representations: Practices, Methods and Sociology, pp. 167-184, (1995); Amelynck D., Grachten M., Van Noorden L., Leman M., Toward EMotion-based music retrieval a study of affective gesture recognition, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 3, 2, pp. 250-259, (2012); Aucouturier J.-J., Bigand E., Mel cepstrum & ann ova: The difficult dialog between MIR and music cognition, ISMIR, (2012); Bath C., De-Gendering von gegenständen der informatik: Ein ansatz zur verankerung von geschlechterforschung in der disziplin, Gender und Diversity in Den Ingenieurwissenschaften und Der Informatik, pp. 166-182, (2008); Bergold J., Thomas S., Participatory research methods: A methodological approach in motion, Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 13, 1, pp. 191-222, (2012); Both G., Multidimensional gendering processes at the human-computer-interface: The case of siri, Gender-UseIT, HCI, Usability und UX Unter Gendergesichtspunkten (Gender-Use-IT 2014), pp. 107-112, (2014); Clayton L., Using the ""Thinking aloud"" method in cognitive interface design, IBM, 1982, (1982); De Bruyn L., Moelants D., Leman M., An embodied approach to testing musical empathy in subjects with an autism spectrum disorder, Music and Medicine, 2011, (2011); Finke P., Citizen Science - Das Unterschätzte Wissen Der Laien, (2014); Haraway D., Situated knowledges: The science question in feminism and the privilege of partial perspective, Feminist Studies, 14, 3, pp. 575-599, (1988); Irrgang M., Was ist gewalt und wie heißt er?

One means to promote greater transparency of search algorithms - which are typically complex and proprietary - is to raise user awareness of biased result sets. However, to date, little is known concerning how users perceive bias in search results, and the degree to which their perceptions differ and/or might be predicted based on user attributes. One particular area of search that has recently gained attention, and forms the focus of this study, is image retrieval and gender bias. We conduct a controlled experiment via crowdsourcing using participants recruited from three countries to measure the extent to which workers perceive a given image results set to be subjective or objective. Demographic information about the workers, along with measures of sexism, are gathered and analysed to investigate whether (gender) biases in the image search results can be detected. Amongst other findings, the results confirm that sexist people are less likely to detect and report gender biases in image search results. © 2018 ACM.","Gender stereotypes; Search engine bias; User perceptions","Search engines; Controlled experiment; Demographic information; Gender bias; Gender stereotypes; Image search; Search Algorithms; User perceptions; Image retrieval","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (732328, 739578)","","Abele A.E., Bruckmuller S., The bigger one of the ""big two""?

The case is situated in between the second and third year of race operations, and describes a variety of digital innovations at FE, leveraging social, mobile, virtual reality, gaming, and artificial intelligence technologies. In the case, two key executives - the CEO and the Head of Digital at FE - appraise the initiatives and raise challenges ahead. The learning objectives include understanding: how to build a passionate and committed fan base locally and globally, not only during race days, but also in-between, under high uncertainty; the characteristics of (disruptive/digital) service innovation; and the varied possibilities and value of intertwining the physical and virtual world.","Digital innovation; Entertainment industry; ESports; Fan engagement; Millennials; Mixed reality; Social media","Information systems; Interactive computer graphics; Digital innovations; E-sports; Entertainment industry; Millennials; Mixed reality; Social media; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Interview Campaign Magazine, (2014)","","","Association for Information Systems","et al.; Intel; Lero; Pepperdine, School of Business and Management; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI); University of Limerick","2016 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2016","11 December 2016 through 14 December 2016","Dublin","127464","","978-099668313-5","","","English","Int.

Past scientific work focused on studying these forms of abusive activity in popular online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Building on such work, we present an eight month study of the various forms of abusive behavior on Twitter, in a holistic fashion. Departing from past work, we examine a wide variety of labeling schemes, which cover different forms of abusive behavior. We propose an incremental and iterative methodology that leverages the power of crowdsourcing to annotate a large collection of tweets with a set of abuse-related labels. By applying our methodology and performing statistical analysis for label merging or elimination, we identify a reduced but robust set of labels to characterize abuse-related tweets. Finally, we offer a characterization of our annotated dataset of 80 thousand tweets, which we make publicly available for further scientific exploration.

In depth interviews were undertaken with seven female game workers based in the UK. The women were interviewed as part of a larger study focusing on women in this male dominated industry. The issues detailed in this chapter focus on the industry as a viable career for women, the experience of being a woman working in games and the working environment; including work life balance issues, experiences of discrimination and experiences of sexism. The research discussed is related to attracting and retaining women in games development.

However, the societal implications of the diffusion of video games into society are dealt with shabbily in existing information systems research. With this study, we want to make a first step to close this gap by looking at intergroup contact between males and females in video games and subsequent effects on prejudice (specifically sexism). Therefore, we build our study around the social identity approach and the contact hypothesis from sociology and social psychology. Accordingly, we propose four different forms of indirect intergroup contact having different effects on prejudice: 1) positive human, 2) negative human, 3) positive avatar, and 4) negative avatar intergroup contact. Within the paper we illustrate the theoretical background, our methodological approach, and give a short outlook. © Proceedings of the 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Secure ICT Platform for the 4th Industrial Revolution, PACIS 2019.","Contact hypothesis; Intergroup contact; Prejudice; Sexism; Video games","Industry 4.0; Information systems; Information use; Sociology; Different effects; Digital innovations; Intergroup contacts; Methodological approach; Social identity; Social psychology; Societal implications; Video game; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Adachi P.

Our study focused on the perpetrator's perspective instead. It aimed to investigate the relationship between a specific sexting behavior, the sharing of someone else's sexts without his/her consent and dating violence perpetration. Specifically, we aimed to test the moderation role of benevolent and hostile sexism in this relationship. The study involved 715 Italian participants from 13 to 30 years of age (Mage = 22.01; females: 71.7%), who completed a survey composed of socio-demographic data, the Sexting Behavior Scale, the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory and the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. The results highlighted that, in the relationship between not-allowed sharing of sexts and dating violence perpetration, benevolent sexism could be a protective factor while, on the contrary, hostile sexism could be a risk factor, controlling for age, gender and sexual orientation. Our findings suggested the existence of a few factors linked to sexting behaviors: these factors could have implications for prevention programs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

First, there are purely practical problems—for example, that scientific experts often disagree on policy-relevant questions and their debates often continue well beyond policy appropriate timelines. Second, there are epistemic problems—for example, that science is hardly the neutral supplier of factual information (free of contested social values) that traditionally has been supposed. And third, there are social problems: given the commercialization of today’s science and its enduring limitations (sexism, racism, homophobia, ableism, etc.), much of scientific research today fails to meet the moral and political standards one would expect it to meet in order to inform public policy. In this paper, we examine such problems in the context of breast cancer screening policy and suggest the role philosophy of science should play in dealing with the situation. © The Author(s) 2018.","breast cancer policy; democratization of science; mammography screening; science and values; science for policy","","","","","","Københavns Universitet, KU; Lunds Universitet; Universiteit Gent; University of Waterloo, UW; Universität Bielefeld; Università di Pisa, UniPi","For lively exchanges and helpful insights, we would like to thank audiences at the University of Copenhagen (International Conference on the Special Role of Science in Liberal Democracy), the University of Waterloo (Science, Technology, and Gender: Challenges and Opportunities Conference), Ghent University (International Workshop on Feminist Philosophy of Science), Lund University (Pittsburgh’s Eighth Quadrennial International Fellows Conference), the University of Pisa (Science and Democracy: Controversies and Conflicts Conference), and Bielefeld University (Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies of Science).

In extreme cases, these incidents have evolved into hate, discrimination, and bullying, and even materialized into real-world threats and attacks against individuals or groups. In this paper, we study the Gamergate controversy. Started in August 2014 in the online gaming world, it quickly spread across various social networking platforms, ultimately leading to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression. We focus on Twitter, presenting a measurement study of a dataset of 340k unique users and 1.6M tweets to study the properties of these users, the content they post, and how they differ from random Twitter users. We find that users involved in this “Twitter war” tend to have more friends and followers, are generally more engaged and post tweets with negative sentiment, less joy, and more hate than random users. We also perform preliminary measurements on how the Twitter suspension mechanism deals with such abusive behaviors. While we focus on Gamergate, our methodology to collect and analyze tweets related to aggressive and bullying activities is of independent interest. © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.","","World Wide Web; Cyber bullying; Measurement study; Negative sentiments; On-line gaming; Online aggressions; Random users; Suspension mechanism; Threats and attacks; Social networking (online)","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC, (691025, H2020-MSCA-RISE)","This work has been funded by the European Commission as part of the ENCASE project (H2020-MSCA-RISE), under GA number 691025.","I Dated Zoe Quinn; Zoe Quinn, Prominent SJW and Indie Developer Is a Liar and a Slut; Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Cristofaro E.D., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Mean Birds: Detecting Aggression and Bullying on Twitter, (2017); Chatzakou D., Koutsonikola V.A., Vakali A., Kafetsios K., Micro-blogging content analysis via emotionally-driven clustering, ACII, (2013); Chen C., Zhang J., Chen X., Xiang Y., Zhou W., 6 million spam tweets: A large ground truth for timely Twitter spam detection, IEEE ICC, (2015); Chen Y., Zhou Y., Zhu S., Xu H., Detecting offensive language in social media to protect adolescent online safety, PASSAT and SocialCom, (2012); Dinakar K., Reichart R., Lieberman H., Modeling the detection of textual cyberbullying, The Social Mobile Web, 11, (2011); Djuric N., Zhou J., Morris R., Grbovic M., Radosavljevic V., Bhamidipati N., Hate speech detection with comment embeddings, WWW, (2015); Giatsoglou M., Chatzakou D., Shah N., Beutel A., Faloutsos C., Vakali A., Nd-sync: Detecting synchronized fraud activities, Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 19th Pacific-Asia Conference, (2015); Go A., Bhayani R., Huang L., Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision, Processing, (2009); Guberman J., Hemphill L., Challenges in modifying existing scales for detecting harassment in individual tweets, System Sciences, (2017); Hern A., Feminist critics of video games facing threats in 'gamergate' campaign, The Guardian, (2014); Hine G.E., Onaolapo J., De Cristofaro E., Kourtellis N., Leontiadis I., Samaras R., Stringhini G., Blackburn J., A Longitudinal Measurement Study of 4chan's Politically Incorrect Forum and Its Effect on the Web, (2016); Hosseinmardi H., Han R., Lv Q., Mishra S., Ghasemianlangroodi A., Towards understanding cyberbullying behavior in a semi-anonymous social network, IEEE/ACM ASONAM, (2014); Hosseinmardi H., Mattson S.A., Rafiq R.I., Han R., Lv Q., Mishra S., Analyzing labeled cyberbullying incidents on the instagram social network, SocInfo, (2015); Kayes I., Kourtellis N., Quercia D., Iamnitchi A., Bonchi F., The social world of content abusers in community question answering, WWW, (2015); Massanari A., #Gamergate and the Fappening: How reddit's algorithm, governance, and culture support toxic technocultures, New Media & Society, (2015); Mortensen T.E., Anger, fear, and games, Games and Culture, (2016); Navarro G., A guided tour to approximate string matching, ACM Comput.

Participants (N = 397) received a message about dating or job interviews presented by a virtual woman in either context-appropriate or context-inappropriate dress. Causal modeling techniques revealed that participants higher on sexism rated the representations as less human (i.e., less anthropomorphic) and less credible. Further, perceived appropriateness of clothing and anthropomorphism influenced perceptions of source trust and message clarity. Implications for understanding the role of trait variables such as sexism on perceptions of virtual representations are discussed. © 2015 International Communication Association.","Anthropomorphism; Avatars;

The research question of the study assessed whether the representation of women in video games leads to female self-objectification and negative body image in adult women. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) review method was used; comprising a thorough keyword database search, followed by literature screening and data extraction. Adult women were the focus of the study, with video games as the study exposure. Only 2 of the 22 studies directly assessed female wellbeing in relation to video game play. Results showed that women do report self-objectification and low levels of self-efficacy, as a result of exposure to objectified female content within video games, compared with participants exposed to nonobjectified content. Male and female belief in real-life female competence was jeopardized after exposure to objectified content of women within video games. Results demonstrated that female characters within video games are unevenly represented compared with male characters, with female characters mostly shown as subordinate to the male hero of the game, objectified, and hypersexualized with disproportionate body parts. The review also uncovered the propensity for men exposed to objectified and sexualized female characters within video games to hold sexist attitudes toward women in a real-life setting, and being more lenient to accept cultural rape myths. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","female wellbeing;

For this reason, hate speech online is a real problem in modern society and the necessity of control of user-generated contents has become one of the priorities for governments, social media platforms and Internet companies. Current methodologies are far from solving this problem. Indeed, several aggressive comments are also disguised as sarcastic. In this perspective, this research proposal wants to investigate the role played by creative linguistic devices, especially sarcasm, in hate speech in multilingual context. © 2011 CEUR-WS.

This experiment investigated whether users' anonymity and level of interactivity with sexist content on social media influenced sexist attitudes and offline behavior. Participants (N = 172) used a Twitter account that was anonymous or had personally identifying details. They were asked to share (i.e., retweet) or write posts incorporating a sexist hashtag. After exposure, participants completed two purportedly unrelated tasks, a survey and a job hiring simulation in which they evaluated male and female candidates' resumés. Anonymous participants reported greater hostile sexism after tweeting than nonanonymous participants. Participants who composed sexist tweets reported greater hostile sexism and ranked female job candidates as less competent than those who retweeted, although this did not significantly affect their likelihood to hire. © 2015, Elsevier Ltd.

I frame the campaign as an example of feminist discursive activism. The site owners collect contributions and aggregate examples of particular discursive patterns in hook up apps, in order to make collective political claims, a strategy that Tomlinson calls “intensification.” I address the existing literature on cyber-misogyny and online harassment, and also research on previous similar campaigns such as Fedoras of OKCupid to discuss shaming as a political practice. I then draw out the patterns and concepts invoked in interventions and resultant discussions on Bye Felipe, examining the themes of rejection, silence and who has the right to silence, rape culture, and gendered sexual entitlement. I identify the political claims being made through the rhetorical strategies described in the first part of the article. Drawing on the work of McCosker on trolling as provocation, I discuss the role of repetition and rehearsal in the practice of discursive politics. Finally, through a discursive analysis of responses to the posts on Instagram and Facebook over time, I explore the ongoing and difficult boundary work around what constitutes appropriate examples for the site, and the articulation of feminist claims and discourses. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","discursive activism; feminism; online activism; online dating; political rhetoric","","","","","","","","Bye Felipe on Instagram: “My friend @thunderpuss did some illustrations of classic #byefelipe submissions, (2015); Bye Felipe on Instagram: “Oh in that case, get in my pants right now!, (2015); Bye Felipe on Instagram: “Send an unsolicited dick pic and you will be shamed. #stopfuckboys2015 #BYEFELIPE, (2015); Abraham B., Fedora shaming as discursive activism, Digital, Culture & Education, 5, pp. 86-97, (2013); Albury K., Crawford K., Sexting, consent and young people’s ethics: Beyond Megan’s Story, Continuum, 26, pp. 463-473, (2012); Bahadur N., Bye Felipe’ beautifully calls out online dating’s worst guys, The Huffington Post, (2014); Barrow J., This woman set up an Instagram to show the shocking truth of being a woman online, BuzzFeed, (2014); Brown S., Instagram account calls out guys who turn nasty when they get rejected—and it’s brilliant, Metro, (2015); Cairns K.V., Sexual entitlement and sexual accommodation: Implications for female and male experience of sexual coercion, The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, 2, pp. 203-213, (1993); Cassandra Z., Managing conflict in virtual environments, (2008); Cross K., Ethics for Cyborgs: On real harassment in an “unreal” place, Loading: The Journal of the Canadian Games Studies Association, 8, pp. 4-21, (2014); Cueto E., @ByeFelipe Instagram account chronicles online dating’s worst conversations, Bustle, (2014); Dobson A.S., Ringrose J., Sext education: Pedagogies of sex, gender and shame in the schoolyards of tagged and exposed, Sex Education, 16, pp. 8-21, (2015); Henry N., Powell A., Embodied harms: Gender, shame, and technology-facilitated sexual violence, Violence against Women, 21, pp. 758-779, (2015); Jane E.A., Your a ugly, whorish, slut, Feminist Media Studies, 14, pp. 531-546, (2012); Jane E.A., Back to the kitchen, cunt”: Speaking the unspeakable about online misogyny, Continuum, 28, pp. 558-570, (2014); Katzenstein M.F., Discursive politics and feminist activism in the catholic church, Feminist organizations: Harvest of the new women’s movement, pp. 35-52, (1995); Kennedy K., Hipparchia the cynic: Feminist rhetoric and the ethics of embodiment, Hypatia, 14, pp. 48-71, (1999); Bye Felicia, (2015); Krueger A., Women turn tables on online harassers, The New York Times, (2015); Maddison S., Young women in the Australian women’s movement: Collective identity and discursive politics, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 6, pp. 234-256, (2004); Maddison S., Discursive politics: Changing the talk and raising expectations, The women’s movement in protest, institutions and the internet, pp. 37-53, (2013); Marwick A.E., Miller R.W., Online harassment, defamation, and hateful speech: A primer of the legal landscape, (2014); Matias J.N., Johnson A., Boesel W.E., Keegan B., Friedman J., DeTar C., Reporting, reviewing, and responding to harassment on Twitter, (2015); McCosker A., Trolling as provocation: YouTube’s agonistic publics, Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 20, pp. 201-217, (2013); Megarry J., Online incivility or sexual harassment?

Popular hashtags include #distractinglySexy, #iLookLikeAnEngineer, and #girlsWithToys. In this study, we set out to investigate why people were reading and using these hashtags and what impact it had on them. We administered a survey, which contained multiple choice and free response questions, to 83 people who had read or used these hashtags. We found that the hashtags ended up serving as an ad hoc online community in which participants found a space of social support. Building an improved sense of awareness was also an important reason for and outcome of participation. We examine the role of hashtags as ad hoc online communities on Twitter and the affects that they have for participants. © First Monday, 1995-2017.","","","","","","","","","Al-Ani B., Mark G., Semaan B., Blogging in a region of conflict: Supporting transition to recovery, , CHI '10: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1069-1078, (2010); Bruns A., Burgess J.E., The use of Twitter hashtags in the formation of ad hoc publics, , Proceedings of the Sixth European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) General Conference 2011, (2011); Coulson N.S., How do online patient support communities affect the experience of inflammatory bowel disease?

We video-recorded the participants as they engaged in semi-structured interviews to explore and understand their experiences as Black women in Computing. Four coders engaged in content analysis on the video-recordings as well as transcripts of the video data in two rounds. Overall, our analysis revealed that the women in our study experienced discrimination, expectations from others that are too high or too low, isolation, sexism, and racism; yet they still choose to stay in the discipline. Remaining true to their personal and professional goals, having effective mentors, and inspiration from their fathers all contributed to their successful pathways and strategies of resistance. © 2018 IEEE.","black women; computer science; computing; intersectionality","Computer programming; Computer science; Engineering; Industrial engineering; black women; computing; Content analysis; intersectionality; Semi structured interviews; Video data; Women in computing; Video recording","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS","I. INTRODUCTION On January 30, 2016, President Barack Obama unveiled an exciting new initiative, Computer Science For All, that would engage all U.S. students, K-12, to not only learn CS, but to also acquire and develop the computational thinking and problem-solving skills and capabilities to move from being solely consumers of technology to also becoming producers of technology [24]. The initiative called for providing $4 billion in funding for states to increase access to CS in K-12 through teacher training, curriculum development, and partnerships with $100 million provided directly for districts; over $135 million in investments over five years by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to support and train CS teachers; and a call to action for state and city leaders, educators, philanthropists, creative media and technology professions, and others to get involved in supporting this initiative [24].","Allen S., Daley K., The Effects of Father Involvement: An Updated Research Summary of Evidence, (2007); Biller H.B., Fathers and Families: Paternal Factors in Child Development, (1993); Burge J.D., Thomas J.O., Yamaguchi R., Follow-Up Workshop: Computing and Intersectionality: The Social and Behavioral Structures at Play for Black Women in the Computing Sciences, (2017); Burge J.D., Thomas J.O., Yamaguchi R., Computing and Intersectionality: The Social and Behavioral Structures at Play for Black Women in the Computing Sciences, (2016); Carbado D.W., Gulati M., The fifth black woman, Journal of Contemporary Legal Issues, 11, pp. 701-729, (2000); Colby S., Ortman J., Projections of the Size and Composition of the U.

Moreover, to deal with the dynamism of the language on social platforms, we also propose an approach based on automatically-enriched lexica.

That task is one of the two sub-tasks organized by AMI-IberEval 2018 organization. In order to carry out the task, we present a neural network approach. Neural network models have been demonstrated to be capable of achieving remarkable performance in sentence and document modeling. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are two mainstream architectures for such modeling tasks, which adopt totally different ways of understanding natural languages. In this work we focus on RNN approach using a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and we evaluate the proposed architecture on misogyny identification task (text classification). The experimental results show that the system can achieve good performance on this task obtaining 78.9 accuracy on English tweets and 76.8 accuracy on Spanish tweets. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

In addition, this paper intends to show up the potential positive effects of non-sexist gender representations in these media. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews studies that have been conducted on various kinds of media, in order to gain and provide a representative overview of gender portrayals and of possible influences they might have on children. Findings: Women are underrepresented in children's literature, television programs, as well as computer-related software. Traditional portrayals of females are also still the norm in these media that children are daily faced with. Alarming trends regarding the representations of males have also been found. The negative influence of sexist representations on children has been shown by numerous studies, as has been the potential of positively affecting children's development by exposing them to non-traditional gender representations. Originality/value: Awareness of how highly present sexism still is in media for children and of the ways in which it may inhibit children's development is seen as a crucial step toward change. Change in this field is needed if we want to ensure a better, more equal future for our world. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Children; Children's literature; Computer; Effects; Gender inequality; Gender representation; Media; Sexism; Television programmes; Traditional representation","","","","","","","","Ahamer G., Human geography trains diverse perspectives on global development, Multicultural Education & Technology Journal, 6, 4, pp. 312-333, (2012); Ahamer G., Multiple cultures of doing geography facilitate global studies, Multicultural Education & Technology Journal, 7, 2-3, pp. 228-250, (2013); Anderson D., Hamilton M., Gender role stereotyping of parents in children's picture books: The invisible father, Sex Roles, 52, 3-4, pp. 145-151, (2005); Ashton E., Measures of play behavior: The influence of sex-role stereotyped children's books, Sex Roles, 9, 1, pp. 43-47, (1983); Aubrey J.S., Harrison K., The gender-role content of children's favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions, Media Psychology, 6, 2, pp. 111-146, (2004); Behm-Morawitz E., Mastro D., The effects of the sexualization of female video game characters on gender stereotyping and female self-concept, Sex Roles, 61, 11-12, pp. 808-823, (2009); Berg-Cross L., Berg-Cross G., Listening to stories may change children's social attitudes, Reading Teacher, 31, 6, pp. 659-663, (1978); Crisp T., Hiller B., Is this a boy or a girl?

Megda (1891), An Imperative Duty (1891), Iola Leroy (1892), The Awakening (1899), Contending Forces (1900), and The House of Mirth (1905) express suspicion about marriage and its potential consequences. These six novels use marriage as a forum to explore the problem of the ""color line,"" sexism, and class difference that promoted social boundaries. These novels demonstrate how choices about marriage made by female protagonists are metaphorical representations of social equality while simultaneously revealing threats to that ideal vision. In a wider context, American Realist Fictions of Marriage aims to widen the conventional narrow focus on canonical realist writers by highlighting intellectual exchanges that were taking place between traditional and non-traditional writers about marriage. © 2017 Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., New York.

Design/methodology/approach: The influence of presenter gender and commenter sentiment towards males and females is investigated for 50 YouTube science channels with a combined view-count approaching ten billion. This is cross-referenced with commenter gender as a proxy for audience gender. Findings: The ratio of male to female commenters varies between 1 and 39 to 1, but the low proportions of females seem to be due to the topic or presentation style rather than the gender of the presenter or the attitudes of the commenters. Although male commenters were more hostile to other males than to females, a few posted inappropriate sexual references that may alienate females. Research limitations/implications: Comments reflect a tiny and biased sample of YouTube science channel viewers and so their analysis provides weak evidence. Practical implications: Sexist behaviour in YouTube commenting needs to be combatted but the data suggest that gender balance in online science presenters should not be the primary concern of channel owners. Originality/value: This is the largest scale analysis of gender in YouTube science communication. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Comment sentiment; Gender differences; Online interaction; Research communication; Science channels; YouTube","Information management; Comment sentiment; Gender differences; On-line interactions; Research communication; Science channels; YouTube; Social sciences","","","","","","","Allgaier J., On the shoulders of YouTube: science in music videos, Science Communication, 35, 2, pp. 266-275, (2013); Alonzo M., Aiken M., Flaming in electronic communication, Decision Support Systems, 36, 3, pp. 205-213, (2004); Baram-Tsabari A., Yarden A., Quantifying the gender gap in science interests, International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 9, 3, pp. 523-550, (2011); Barry D.S., Marzouk F., Chulak-Oglu K., Bennett D., Tierney P., O'Keeffe G.W., Anatomy education for the YouTube generation, Anatomical Sciences Education, 9, 1, pp. 90-96, (2016); Barthelemy R.S., McCormick M., Henderson C., Gender discrimination in physics and astronomy: graduate student experiences of sexism and gender microaggressions, Physical Review Physics Education Research, 12, 2, (2016); Bettinger E.P., Long B.T., Do faculty serve as role models?

This has attracted the interests of politicians, committing large investments and tax breaks. Although the headline figures are impressive, the overall structure of the industry is less clear. Within this there are many new organizations, often shaped by start-up culture. Less is known about how work is being organized or the experiences of workers. The approach taken here draws on Marxist theory and an examination of the labour process. It focuses on how capitalism effects the production of video games, including the use of crunch time, the prevalence of sexism, and the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements. The conclusion suggests further enquiries are needed to understand how the struggle between labour and capital is shaping this industry. © 2016 Intellect Ltd Article.

Mixed-method analyses revealed that women were depicted more in bikinis, posed in overtly sexually suggestive poses, excluded the women’s eyes and faces, and included predominately White, fit, big-breasted women. There was a positive correlation between the number of likes/comments with breast size. There were also instances of misogyny and objectification manifested in the men’s comments attached to the photographs. The results highlight Instagram as a digital extension of fraternal social spaces. TFM Girls reinforces hegemonic masculinity on a macro-level by allowing virtual linkages among fraternity members across the United States and by fostering a national online frat house ripe with misogyny and objectification. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","digital media;

Since it reveals “who one sides with”, expression of moral judgment can be a costly social act that people may be motivated to conceal. Here, we demonstrate that a simple, well-studied psycholinguistic task (implicit causality) can be leveraged as a novel implicit measure of morally relevant causal attributions. Participants decided whether to continue sentences like “Amy killed Bob because...” with either the pronoun he or she. We found that (1) implicit causality selections predicted explicit causal judgments, (2) selecting the object (victim) for harm/force events (e.g., kill, rape) predicted endorsement of moral values previously linked to victim-blame, and (3) higher hostile sexism predicted selecting the female as the cause in male-on-female harm/force. The implicit causality task is a new measure of morally motivated causal attribution that may circumvent social desirability concerns. © 2016 Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, CogSci 2016.

In practice, it is characterized by viciously sexual and sexist attacks on women in and around gaming communities. #Gamergate is also a site for articulating “Gamergater” as a form of geek masculinity. #Gamergate discussions across social media platforms illustrate how Gamergaters produce and reproduce this gendered identity. Gamergaters perceive themselves as crusaders, under siege from critics they pejoratively refer to as SJWs (social justice warriors). By leveraging social media for concern-trolling about gaming as an innocuous masculine pastime, Gamergaters situate the heterosexual White male as both the typical gamer and the real victim of #Gamergate. #Gamergate is a specific and virulent online node in broader discussions of privilege, difference, and identity politics. Gamergaters are an instructive example of how social media operate as vectors for public discourses about gender, sexual identity, and equality, as well as safe spaces for aggressive and violent misogyny. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Gamergate; gaming cultures; geek masculinity; online harassment; social media","","","","","","","","Alexander L., Gamers” don’t have to be your audience: “Gamers” are over, Gamasutra, (2014); Anable A., Casual games, time management, and the work of affect, Ada 2, (2013); Braithwaite A., Seriously, get out”: Feminists on the forums and the war(craft) on women, New Media & Society, 16, pp. 703-718, (2014); Brock A., When keeping it real goes wrong”: Resident Evil 5, racial representation, and gamers, Games and Culture, 6, pp. 429-452, (2011); Burrill D.A., Die tryin’: Videogames, masculinity, culture, (2008); Butler J., Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity, (1990); Campbell O., [Tweets], (2015); Cassell J., Jenkins H., From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and computer games, (2000); Chess S., Shaw A., A conspiracy of fishes, or, how we learned to stop worrying about #GamerGate and embrace hegemonic masculinity, Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 59, pp. 208-220, (2015); Collins S.T., Anita Sarkeesian on GamerGate: “We have a problem and we’re going to fix this, Rolling Stone, (2014); The Colbert report—Gamergate—Anita Sarkeesian, YouTube, (2014); Condis M., No homosexuals in Star Wars?

For this reason, there has been both an academic and an industry interest in detection of hate speech. The volume of data to be reviewed for creating data sets encourages a use of crowd sourcing for the annotation efforts. In this paper, we provide an examination of the influence of annotator knowledge of hate speech on classification models by comparing classification results obtained from training on expert and amateur annotations. We provide an evaluation on our own data set and run our models on the data set released by Waseem and Hovy (2016). We find that amateur annotators are more likely than expert annotators to label items as hate speech, and that systems trained on expert annotations outperform systems trained on amateur annotations.  ©2016 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Speech recognition; Classification models; Classification results; Crowd sourcing; Data set; Expert annotations; Speech detection; Speech","","","","","","","Bamman David, Smith Noah, Contextualized sarcasm detection on twitter, (2015); Brown Peter F., deSouza Peter V., Mercer Robert L., Della Pietra Vincent J., Lai Jenifer C., Classbased n-gram models of natural language, Comput.

Despite its emerging prevalence, little is known about the characteristics of revenge porn perpetrators. In the current study, a revenge porn proclivity scale was devised to examine participants' behavioural propensity to engage in revenge porn. One hundred adults, aged 18-54, were recruited online from a community sample. The correlational relationship between revenge porn proclivity and the self-reported endorsement of the Dark Triad, sadism, and ambivalent sexism was examined. Additional proclivity subscales of revenge porn enjoyment and revenge porn approval were also created. The study's main findings revealed a positive correlation between a greater behavioural propensity to engage in revenge porn and higher levels of the Dark Triad and ambivalent sexism. Moreover, endorsement of psychopathy was found to be the only Dark Triad trait that independently predicted revenge porn proclivity. The results suggest that perpetrators of revenge porn may have distinct personality profiles. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. © 2018, IGI Global.

We feature six video projects created for a fall 2015 undergraduate class on the analysis of popular culture. As models, these videos encourage writing and rhetoric instructors to invite students to communicate their own intersectional identities and values through multimodal assignments. Doing so remixes the possibilities for how and where students’ ideas can take shape. Organized into the two thematic categories of 1. media misrepresentation and rape culture and 2. anticapitalist criticism and feminist parody, this article shows how students’ videos that adapt such genres as the consumerism-based haul video and musical video parody mobilize feminist rhetorical criticism. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Feminism; Haul; Intersectionality; Media; Parody; Popular culture; Remix; Rhetorical criticism; Video; YouTube","","","","","","","","Alexander J., Rhodes J., Sexual rhetorics: Methods, identities, publics, (2016); Almjeld J., Michelli A., Weatherhead C., Frederick K., Perez S., Germain Melanie Yergeau J., Et al., The f-word: A decade of hidden feminism in kairos, Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric Technology and Pedagogy, 20, 2, (2016); (2015); Blair K., Gajjala R., Tulley C., Webbing cyberfeminist practice: Communities, pedagogies, and social action, (2009); Briggs, Timothy J., Three frameworks and a pedagogical approach: Teaching video arguments in first-year composition., (2014); Brummett B., Rhetoric in popular culture, (2015); Butler J., Where access meets multimodality: The case of ASL music videos, Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric Technology and Pedagogy, (2016); Carter G.V., Arroyo S.J., Tubing the future: Participatory pedagogy and YouTube U in 2020, Computers and Composition, 28, pp. 292-302, (2011); Colton J.S., Revisiting digital sampling rhetorics with an ethics of care, Computers and Composition, 40, pp. 19-31, (2016); Craig T., ‘Makin’ somethin’ outta little-to-nufin”: Racism, revision and rotating records: the hip-hop DJ in composition praxis, Changing English: Studies in Culture and Education, 22, pp. 349-364, (2015); Dolmage J., Universal design: Places to start, Disability Studies Quarterly, 35, 2, (2015); Dubisar A.M., Palmeri J., Palin/pathos/Peter Griffin: Political video remix and composition pedagogy, Computers and Composition, 27, pp. 77-93, (2010); Edwards D., Framing remix rhetorically: Toward a typology of transformative work, Computers and Composition, 39, pp. 41-54, (2016); Enoch J., Jack J., Remembering Sappho: New perspectives on teaching (and writing) women's rhetorical history, College English, 73, pp. 518-537, (2011); Fishman J., Lunsford A., McGregor B., Otuteye M., Performing writing, performing literacy, College Composition and Communication, 57, pp. 224-252, (2005); Fiske J., Reading the popular, (2011); Fudge R., Kiss me I'm a fashionable bigot, Bitch, 26, pp. 61-67, (2004); Gay R., Bad feminist: Essays, (2014); (2015); Godin S., (2016); Goldstein L.R., Multimodal invention and rhetorical velocity: Students (re)define composing and themselves as composers in a gen-ed writing course (Doctoral dissertation), (2015); Greer J., Undergraduates in the archives: Researching girls’ literacies as feminist activism, Peitho, 11, pp. 2-8, (2009); Grobman L., The student scholar: (Re)negotiating authorship and authority, College Composition and Communication, 61, pp. W175-W196, (2009); Grobman L., Kinkead J., Undergraduate research in English studies, (2010); Hafner C.A., Remix culture and English language teaching: The expression of learning voice in digital multimodal compositions, TESOL Quarterly, 49, pp. 486-509, (2015); Hagood M.C., A rhizomatic cartography of adolescents, popular culture, and constructions of self, Spatializing literacy research and practice, pp. 143-160, (2004); Halbritter B., Big questions, small works, lots of layers: Documentary video production and the teaching of academic research and writing, Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric Technology and Pedagogy, 16, 1, (2011); Hocks M., Feminist interventions in electronic environments, Computers and Composition, 16, pp. 107-119, (1999); Hopper J., The first collection of criticism by a living female rock critic, (2015); Jackson B., Wallin J., Rediscovering the back-and-forthness of rhetoric in the age of YouTube, College Composition and Communication, 61, pp. W374-W396, (2009); Jeffries L., The revolution will be soooo cute: YouTube hauls and the voice of young female consumers, Studies in Popular Culture, 33, 2, pp. 59-75, (2011); (2015); Kramarae C., Cyberfeminist practice: An after-word leading to the future, Webbing cyberfeminist practice: Communities, pedagogies, and social action, pp. 385-392, (2009); Kroeger F., A freshman paper based on the words of popular songs, College Composition and Communication, 19, pp. 337-340, (1968); Losh E., The war on learning: Gaining ground in the digital university, (2014); MacKay M., (2014); (2005); Palmeri J., Remixing composition: A history of multimodal writing pedagogy, (2012); (2012); Petridis A., Youth subcultures: What are they now?, (2014); (2009); Rhodes J., Radical feminism, writing, and critical agency: From manifesto to modem, (2005); Romano T., Look what I bought (or got free), (2010); Russell B., Dear Future Husband lyrical parody, (2015); Trainor M., Kadish K., Dear future husband [Recorded by Meghan Trainor].

They were shown a picture of either a young or old woman or man and asked to assess the likelihood that this person would use a desktop computer, laptop computer and a smartphone, and their level of expertise in each of these technologies. The results showed that the students did have negative perceptions of the older people in comparison to young people. They also thought that women were less expert with the technologies than men, although there was no difference in the likelihood of them using the technology. However, there was no evidence of a “double standard” of older women being perceived particularly negatively. © The Author(s) 2018.","Ageism; Perceptions of older people; Perceptions of older women; Perceptions of technology expertise; Perceptions of technology use; Sexism","Laptop computers; Ageism; Computer science students; Computer scientists; Older People; Sexism; Technology use; Young peoples; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Chase C., An intergenerational e-mail pal project of attitudes of college students toward older adults, Educ.

Although e-bile is new in terms of its prevalence, rhetorical noxiousness, and stark misogyny, prototypes of this discourse—most commonly referred to as ‘flaming’—have always circulated on the internet, and, as such, have been discussed by scholars from a range of disciplines. Nevertheless, my review of this vast body of literature reveals that online hostility has historically posed a number of conceptual, methodological, and epistemological challenges due to which scholars have typically underplayed, overlooked, ignored, or otherwise marginalised its prevalence and serious ethical and material ramifications. Fortunately, lessons learned from my analysis suggests promising approaches for future research into this challenging form of new media discourse. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","E-bile; Ethics; Flaming; Gender; Internet; Trolling","Ethical aspects; Information technology; Internet; Social sciences; Critical problems; Flaming; Gender; New media; Trolling; Philosophical aspects","","","","","","","Aedy R., A journalist’s guide to finding the truth via social media.

Computer Science, E.Orabona 4, Bari, 70125, Italy","The task of identifying hate speech in social networks has recently attracted considerable interest in the community of natural language processing. This challenge has great importance for identifying cyberattacks on minors, bullying activities, misogyny, or other kinds of hate discriminations that can cause diseases. Identifying them quickly and accurately can, therefore, help to solve situations that are dangerous for the health of the attacked people. Numerous national and international initiatives have addressed this problem by providing many resources and solutions to the problem. In particular, we focus on the Hate Speech Detection evaluation campaign (HaSpeeDe) held at Evalita 2018. It proposes an evaluation campaign with the aim of developing strategies for identifying hate speeches on Twitter and Facebook written in the Italian language. The dataset released for the task has been used by the classification approach proposed in this work for demonstrating that it is possible to solve the task efficiently and accurately. Our solution is based on an Italian Language Understanding model trained with a BERT architecture and 200M of Italian Tweets (AlBERTo). We used AlBERTo for fine-tuning a classification model of hate speech, obtaining state of the art results considering the best systems presented at the HaSpeeDe workshop. In this regard, AlBERTo is here proposed as one of the most versatile resources to be used for the task of classification of Social Media Textual contents in the Italian Language. The claim is supported by the similar results obtained by AlBERTo in the task of sentiment analysis, and irony detection demonstrated in previous works. The resources need for fine-tuning AlBERTo in these classification tasks are available at: https://github.com/marcopoli/AlBERTo-it Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.","AlBERTo; Classification; Deep Learning; Hate Speech; Language understanding model; Machine Learning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Speech; AlBERTo; Classification approach; Classification models; Classification tasks; Developing strategy; Language understanding; NAtural language processing; State of the art; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Bai X., Merenda F., Zaghi C., Caselli T., Nissim M., Rug@ evalita 2018: Hate speech detection in italian social media, EVALITA@ CLiC-It, (2018); Barbieri F., Basile V., Croce D., Nissim M., Novielli N., Patti V., Overview of the evalita 2016 sentiment polarity classification task, Proceedings of Third Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-It 2016) & Fifth Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian.

Male and female participants (N = 301) who were players of networked video games were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. Social dominance orientation and conformity to some types of masculine norms (desire for power over women and the need for heterosexual self-presentation) predicted higher scores on the Video Game Sexism Scale (i.e., greater sexist beliefs about women and gaming). Implications for the social gaming environment and female gamers are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, hate speech is used more and more, to the point where it has become a serious problem invading these open spaces. Hate speech refers to the use of aggressive, violent or offensive language, targeting a specific group of people sharing a common property, whether this property is their gender (i.e., sexism), their ethnic group or race (i.e., racism) or their believes and religion. While most of the online social networks and microblogging websites forbid the use of hate speech, the size of these networks and websites makes it almost impossible to control all of their content. Therefore, arises the necessity to detect such speech automatically and filter any content that presents hateful language or language inciting to hatred. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect hate expressions on Twitter. Our approach is based on unigrams and patterns that are automatically collected from the training set. These patterns and unigrams are later used, among others, as features to train a machine learning algorithm. Our experiments on a test set composed of 2010 tweets show that our approach reaches an accuracy equal to 87.4% on detecting whether a tweet is offensive or not (binary classification), and an accuracy equal to 78.4% on detecting whether a tweet is hateful, offensive, or clean (ternary classification). © 2018 IEEE.","hate speech; machine learning; sentiment analysis; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Speech; Websites; Binary classification; Common property; Offensive languages; On-line social networks; Sentiment analysis; Speech detection; Training sets; Twitter; Speech recognition","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (15H04010)","","King R.D., Sutton G.M., High times for hate crimes: Explaining the temporal clustering of hate-motivated offending, Criminology, 51, 4, pp. 871-894, (2013); Breckheimer J.P., A haven for hate: The foreign and domestic implications of protecting Internet hate speech under the first amendment, South California Law Rev., 75, 6, (2002); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Cyber hate speech on twitter: An application of machine classification and statistical modeling for policy and decision making, Policy Internet, 7, 2, pp. 223-242, (2015); Razavi A.H., Inkpen D., Uritsky S., Matwin S., Offensive language detection using multi-level classification, Advances in Artificial Intelligence, 6085, pp. 16-27, (2010); Warner W., Hirschberg J., Detecting hate speech on the world wide Web, Proc. 2nd Workshop Lang.

The petition challenged the Bank of England's original plan to replace Fry with Winston Churchill, which would have meant that no woman aside from the Queen would be represented on any UK banknote. Following this, Criado-Perez was subjected to ongoing misogynistic abuse on Twitter, a microblogging social network, including threats of rape and death. This paper investigates this increasingly prominent phenomenon of rape threats made via social networks. Specifically, we investigate the sustained period of abuse directed towards the Twitter account of feminist campaigner and journalist, Caroline Criado-Perez. We then turn our attention to the formation of online discourse communities as they respond to and participate in forms of extreme online misogyny on Twitter. We take a corpus of 76,275 tweets collected during a three month period in which the events occurred (July to September 2013), which comprises 912,901 words. We then employ an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of language in the context of this social network. Our approach combines quantitative approaches from the fields of corpus linguistics to detect emerging discourse communities, and then qualitative approaches from discourse analysis to analyse how these communities construct their identities. © 2015 The Authors.","Computer-mediated-communication; Identity; Rape threats; Trolling; Trolls; Twitter","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/K002155/1, ES/L008874/1)","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/L008874/1 ].

In the wake of growing documentation of experiences of sexism on the web, the automatic categorization of accounts of sexism has the potential to assist social scientists and policy makers in utilizing such data to study and counter sexism better. The existing work on sexism classification, which is different from sexism detection, has certain limitations in terms of the categories of sexism used and/or whether they can co-occur. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the multi-label classification of sexism of any kind(s), and we contribute the largest dataset for sexism categorization. We develop a neural solution for this multi-label classification that can combine sentence representations obtained using models such as BERT with distributional and linguistic word embeddings using a flexible, hierarchical architecture involving recurrent components and optional convolutional ones. Further, we leverage unlabeled accounts of sexism to infuse domain-specific elements into our framework. The best proposed method outperforms several deep learning as well as traditional machine learning baselines by an appreciable margin. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Classification (of information); Recurrent neural networks; Automatic categorization; Domain specific; Hierarchical architectures; Multi label classification; Multi-label categorization; Policy makers; Recurrent components; Social scientists; Natural language processing systems","","","","","","","Agrawal S., Awekar A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms, European Conference on Information Retrieval, pp. 141-153, (2018); Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64, (2018); Artstein R., Poesio M., Inter-coder agreement for computational linguistics, Computational Linguistics, 34, 4, pp. 555-596, (2008); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Bojanowski P., Grave E., Joulin A., Mikolov T., Enriching word vectors with subword information, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Boutell M.R., Luo J., Shen X., Brown C.M., Learning multi-label scene classification, Pattern Recognition, 37, 9, pp. 1757-1771, (2004); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Us and Them: Identifying cyber hate on twitter across multiple protected characteristics, EPJ Data Science, 5, 1, (2016); Cer D., Yang Y., Kong S.-Y., Hua N., Limtiaco N., John R.S., Constant N., Guajardo-Cespedes M., Yuan S., Tar C., Et al., Universal Sentence Encoder, (2018); Cohen J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Conneau A., Kiela D., Schwenk H., Barrault L., Bordes A., Supervised learning of universal sentence representations from natural language inference data, Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 670-680, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Dutta D., Sircar O., India's winter of discontent: Some feminist dilemmas in the wake of a rape, Feminist Studies, 39, 1, pp. 293-306, (2013); Eccles J.S., Jacobs J.E., Harold R.D., Gender role stereotypes, expectancy effects, and parents' socialization of gender differences, Journal of Social Issues, 46, 2, pp. 183-201, (1990); Gao L., Kuppersmith A., Huang R., Recognizing explicit and implicit hate speech using a weakly supervised two-path bootstrapping approach, Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 774-782, (2017); Jafarpour B., Matwin S., Et al., Boosting text classification performance on sexist tweets by text augmentation and text generation using a combination of knowledge graphs, Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Abusive Language Online (ALW2), pp. 107-114, (2018); Jha A., Mamidi R., When does a compliment become sexist?

Cultivation theory suggests that long-term exposure to media content can affect perceptions of social realities in a way that they become more similar to the representations in the media and, in turn, impact one's beliefs and attitudes. Previous studies on video games and cultivation have often been cross-sectional or experimental, and the limited longitudinal work in this area has only considered time intervals of up to 1 month. Additionally, previous work in this area has focused on the effects of violent content and relied on self-selected or convenience samples composed mostly of adolescents or college students. Enlisting a 3 year longitudinal design, the present study assessed the relationship between video game use and sexist attitudes, using data from a representative sample of German players aged 14 and older (N=824). Controlling for age and education, it was found that sexist attitudes - measured with a brief scale assessing beliefs about gender roles in society - were not related to the amount of daily video game use or preference for specific genres for both female and male players. Implications for research on sexism in video games and cultivation effects of video games in general are discussed. © 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aggression; Attitude; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Perception; Sexism; Video Games; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; aggression; attitude; female; human; longitudinal study; male; perception; psychology; sexism; statistics and numerical data; video game; young adult","","","","","","","2014 Sales, demographic and usage data, Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry., (2014); Beasley B., Collins Standley T., Shirts vs. Skins: Clothing as an indicator of gender role stereotyping in video games, Mass Communication & Society, 5, pp. 279-293, (2002); Downs E., Smith S.L., Keeping abreast of hypersexuality: A video game character content analysis, Sex Roles, 62, pp. 721-733, (2009); Dietz T., An examination of violence and gender role portrayals in video games: Implications for gender socialization and aggressive behavior, Sex Roles, 38, pp. 425-442, (1998); Ivory J., Still a man's game: Gender representation in online reviews of video games, Mass Communication & Society, 9, pp. 103-114, (2006); Miller M.K., Summers A., Gender differences in video game characters' roles, appearances, and attire as portrayed in video game magazines, Sex Roles, 57, pp. 733-742, (2007); Burgess M.C.R., Stermer S.P., Burgess S.R., Sex, lies, and video games: The portrayal of male and female characters on video game covers, Sex Roles, 57, pp. 419-433, (2007); Williams D., Martins N., Consalvo M., Ivory J.D., The virtual census: Representations of gender, race and age in video games, New Media & Society, 11, pp. 815-834, (2009); Heintz-Knowles K., Henderson J., Glaubke C., Et al., Fair Play?

The study found no evidence of sexism, but a clear lack of diversity in the sports covered, as NBC dedicated most of its prime time to superstars (Phelps, Biles, Bolt, Kerri Walsh, etc.) and unique stories and personalities (e.g., the Lochtegate and 74-year-old South African coach Botha). © The Author(s) 2017.","content analysis; framing; journalism; Olympics; quantitative; sports","","","","","","","","Alexander S., Newspaper coverage of athletics as a function of gender, Women’s Studies International Forum, 17, pp. 655-662, (1994); Angelini J.R., Billings A.C., The agenda that sets the frames: Gender, language, and NBC’s Americanized Olympic telecast, Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29, pp. 363-385, (2010); Angelini J.R., MacArthur P.J., Billings A.C., What’s the gendered story?

A sample of 361 Portuguese healthcare workers participated in this study. The results indicate some significant work-related risk factors: for emotional well-being, Impossible to express myself (β = −0.977), Not having recognition by superiors (β = −1.028) and Have to simulate good mood and/or empathy (β = −1.007); for social well-being, Exposed to the risk of sexual discrimination (β = −2.088), Career progress is almost impossible (β = −1.518), and Have to hide my emotions (β = −2.307); finally for psychological well-being Exposed to the risk of sexual discrimination (β = −2.153), Career progress is almost impossible (β = −1.377), and Have to simulate good mood and/or empathy (β = −3.201). The results showed high levels of well-being despite the exposure of several risk factors at workplace. Regarding the work-related risk factors, the study showed that most of the participants are exposed to several risk factors at workplace (ranging from environmental risk factors, biological to physical), although psychosocial risk factors (work relations with superiors and colleagues, employment relations, and emotional demands) are the ones that most impact on well-being. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Healthcare workers; Patient safety; Psychosocial work factors; Well-being dimensions; Work-related risk factors","Health Personnel; Humans; Occupational Health; Patient Safety; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace; adult; aged; Article; career; emotion; employment; female; health care personnel; health promotion; human; male; mental health; occupational health; patient safety; psychological well-being; risk factor; sexism; wellbeing; workplace; questionnaire; reproducibility","","","","","","","Roland-Levy C., Lemoine J., Jeoffrion C., Health and well-being at work: The hospital context, Revue Européenne de Psychologie Appliquée/European Review of Applied Psychology, 64, 2, pp. 53-62, (2014); Stansfeld S.A., Candy B., Psychosocial work environment and mental health—a meta-analytic review, Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health, 6, pp. 443-462, (2006); An Overview, (2010); Giurgiu D.I., Jeoffrion C., Et al., Psychosocial and occupational risk perception among health care workers: a Moroccan multicenter study, BMC Research Notes, 8, 1, (2015); Giurgiu D.I., Jeoffrion C., Et al., Wellbeing and occupational risk perception among health care workers: a multicenter study in Morocco and France, Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology, 11, 1, (2016); Commission E., Occupational health and safety risks in healthcare sector - Guide to prevention and good practice S.A.a.I, Directorate-General Dor Employment, Editor, Publications Office of the European Union: Luxemburg, (2011); Ryff C.D., Happiness is everything, or is it?

This paper explores the ethical implications of this celebrity nude photo leak within a frame of gendered privacy violations. I analyze a selection of a mass capture of 5143 posts and 94,602 comments from /thefappening subreddit, as well as editorials written by female celebrities, feminists, and journalists. Redditors justify the photo leak by arguing the subjects are privileged because they are celebrities; that the celebrities are at fault for failing to appropriately protect their information; and that the only person ethically responsible for the leak is the hacker. The popular press primarily took a feminist perspective, linking the photo leak to institutionalized sexism and misogyny. I argue that the Reddit participants frame the privacy violations within a context of geek masculinity, in which references to masturbation and pornography and casually misogynist language are used to signify a normative masculine self. Privacy violations are de-emphasized when the victims are women and gender or feminist concerns are rejected. Entitlement to viewing women’s bodies and male sexual desire are prioritized over ethical concerns over privacy violations. The paper contributes to understanding how privacy violations are normatively gendered and reinforced by gender inequality. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Celebrities; Gender and privacy; Online misogyny; Reddit; Revenge porn; Sexting","Personal computing; Philosophical aspects; Celebrities; Online misogyny; Reddit; Revenge porn; Sexting; Crime","","","","","Data & Society Research Institute","Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Dr. Elena Fila-tova (New York City College of Technology) and Dr. Alex Leavitt (Facebook Research) for their assistance collecting data from Reddit.

This problem is urgent because of the high speed at which messages on social platforms grow and the widespread use of offensive language (including misogynistic language) in them. In this article we survey approaches proposed in the literature to solve the problem of misogynistic message recognition. These include classical machine learning models like Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and ensembles of different classical machine learning models, as well as deep neural networks such as Long Short-term memory and Convolutional Neural Networks. We consider results of experiments with these models in different languages: English, Spanish and Italian tweets. The survey describes some features, which help to identify misogynistic tweets and some challenges, which aim was to create misogyny language classifiers. The survey includes not only models, which help to identify misogyny language, but also systems which help to recognize a target of an offense (an individual or a group of persons). © 2019 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

Brain cells and neural circuits are likely to be influenced by estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) because they strongly dependent on estrogens. In this review, we discuss both environmental, epidemiological, and experimental evidence on brain health with exposure to oral contraceptives, hormonal therapy, and EEDs such as bisphenol-A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates, and metalloestrogens, such as, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese. Also we discuss the brain health effects associated from exposure to EEDs including the promotion of neurodegeneration, protection against neurodegeneration, and involvement in various neurological deficits; changes in rearing behavior, locomotion, anxiety, learning difficulties, memory issues, and neuronal abnormalities. The effects of EEDs on the brain are varied during the entire life span and far-reaching with many different mechanisms. To understand endocrine disrupting chemicals mechanisms, we use bioinformatics, molecular, and epidemiologic approaches. Through those approaches, we learn how the effects of EEDs on the brain go beyond known mechanism to disrupt the circulatory and neural estrogen function and estrogen-mediated signaling. Effects on EEDs-modified estrogen and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) signaling genes with exposure to natural estrogen, pharmacological estrogen-ethinyl estradiol, PCBs, phthalates, BPA, and metalloestrogens are presented here. Bioinformatics analysis of gene-EEDs interactions and brain disease associations identified hundreds of genes that were altered by exposure to estrogen, phthalate, PCBs, BPA or metalloestrogens. Many genes modified by EEDs are common targets of both 17 β-estradiol (E2) and NRF1. Some of these genes are involved with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Brain Neoplasms. For example, the search of enriched pathways showed that top ten E2 interacting genes in AD—APOE, APP, ATP5A1, CALM1, CASP3, GSK3B, IL1B, MAPT, PSEN2 and TNF—underlie the enrichment of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) AD pathway. With AD, the six E2-responsive genes are NRF1 target genes: APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1. These genes are also responsive to the following EEDs: ethinyl estradiol (APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), BPA (APBB2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), dibutyl phthalate (DPYSL2, EIF2S1, and ENO1), diethylhexyl phthalate (DPYSL2 and MAPT). To validate findings from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) curated data, we used Bayesian network (BN) analysis on microarray data of AD patients. We observed that both gender and NRF1 were associated with AD. The female NRF1 gene network is completely different from male human AD patients. AD-associated NRF1 target genes—APLP1, APP, GRIN1, GRIN2B, MAPT, PSEN2, PEN2, and IDE—are also regulated by E2. NRF1 regulates targets genes with diverse functions, including cell growth, apoptosis/autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, genomic instability, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and senescence. By activating or repressing the genes involved in cell proliferation, growth suppression, DNA damage/repair, apoptosis/autophagy, angiogenesis, estrogen signaling, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and senescence, and inducing a wide range of DNA damage, genomic instability and DNA methylation and transcriptional repression, NRF1 may act as a major regulator of EEDs-induced brain health deficits. In summary, estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals-modified genes in brain health deficits are part of both estrogen and NRF1 signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that in addition to estrogen signaling, EEDs influencing NRF1 regulated communities of genes across genomic and epigenomic multiple networks may contribute in the development of complex chronic human brain health disorders. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Brain health; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Estrogen; Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1)","Brain Diseases; Endocrine Disruptors; Estrogens; Female; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Male; Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1; Sexism; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; cadmium; catechol estrogen; endocrine disruptor; estrogenic endocrine disruptor; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; heavy metal; interleukin 1beta; luteinizing hormone; manganese; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor 1; nuclear respiratory factor 1; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; transcription factor; transcription factor Nrf1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; nuclear respiratory factor 1; Alzheimer disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; anxiety; behavior disorder; bioinformatics; brain disease; congenital malformation; dementia; gene expression; hormonal therapy; human; nerve cell plasticity; nerve degeneration; Parkinson disease; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; signal transduction; synaptogenesis; Brain Diseases; drug effects; female; gene regulatory network; genetics; male; metabolism; sexism","","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol, 80-05-7; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha, ; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, ; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; phthalic acid, 88-99-3; Endocrine Disruptors, ; Estrogens, ; Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1, ","","","","","State of the Science of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals, WHO Press, pp. 1-272, (2012); Roy D., Palangat M., Chen C.W., Thomas R.T., Colerangle J.C., Atkinson A., Yan Z.J., Biochemical and molecular changes at the cellular levels in response to exposure of environmental estrogen-like chemicals, J.

Although a small sample, the study provided an interesting insight into the experiences of the females on the course as well as their views of entering (or at least potentially entering) the male dominated computer games industry. The findings related by the chapter reveal that females choose to study games because they enjoyed playing games. Despite all participants experiencing the course positively, there was some apprehension about going into the industry. Interestingly, the study suggests the male dominated working environment may be off-putting to women, even to women studying and interested in going into that area of work. The main themes that emerged in regard to the negativity associated with the industry were the long hours culture and potential sexism within the industry. © 2014, IGI Global.

The task focused on the detection of misogyny in English and Spanish tweets and was articulated in two sub-tasks addressing the identification of misogyny at different levels of granularity. We describe the final submitted systems for both languages and sub-tasks: Task A is a classical binary classification task to determine whether a tweet is misogynous or not, while Task B is a finer grained classification task devoted to distinguish different types of misogyny, where systems must predict (i) one out of five categories of misogynistic behaviours and (ii) if the abusive content was purposely addressed to a specific target or not. We propose an SVM-based architecture and explore the use of several sets of features, including a wide range of lexical features relying on the use of available and novel lexicons of abusive words, with a special focus on sexist slurs and abusive words targeting women in the two languages at issue. Our systems ranked first in Task A for both English and Spanish (accuracy score of 0.913 for English; 0.815 for Spanish), outperforming the baselines and the other participant systems, and first in Task B on Spanish. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

That’s what the industry wants us to think. Why and how we came to comply are what Carly A. Kocurek investigates in this provocative consideration of how an industry’s craving for respectability hooked up with cultural narratives about technology, masculinity, and youth at the video arcade. From the dawn of the golden age of video games with the launch of Atari’s Pong in 1972, through the industry-wide crash of 1983, to the recent nostalgia-bathed revival of the arcade, Coin-Operated Americans explores the development and implications of the ""video gamer"" as a cultural identity. This cultural-historical journey takes us to the Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa, Iowa, for a close look at the origins of competitive gaming. It immerses us in video gaming’s first moral panic, generated by Exidy’s Death Race (1976), an unlicensed adaptation of the film Death Race 2000. And it ventures into the realm of video game films such as Tron and WarGames, in which gamers become brilliant, boyish heroes. Whether conducting a phenomenological tour of a classic arcade or evaluating attempts, then and now, to regulate or eradicate arcades and coin-op video games, Kocurek does more than document the rise and fall of a now-booming industry. Drawing on newspapers, interviews, oral history, films, and television, she examines the factors and incidents that contributed to the widespread view of video gaming as an enclave for young men and boys. A case study of this once emergent and now revived medium became the presumed enclave of boys and young men, Coin-Operated Americans is history that holds valuable lessons for contemporary culture as we struggle to address pervasive sexism in the domain of video games-and in the digital working world beyond. © 2015 by the Regents of the University of Minnesota.

The models are based on a Support Vector Machine and they use n-grams as features. Our solution is very simple and yet we achieve top results on Italian Tweets and excellent results on English Tweets. Furthermore, we experiment with a single model that works across languages by leveraging abstract features.

The starting point is the Italian hate lexicon developed by the linguist Tullio De Mauro, organized in 17 categories. It has been expanded through the link to available synset-based computational lexical resources such as MultiWordNet and BabelNet, and evolved in a multi-lingual perspective by semiautomatic translation and expert annotation. A twofold evaluation of HurtLex as a resource for hate speech detection in social media is provided: a qualitative evaluation against an Italian annotated Twitter corpus of hate against immigrants, and an extrinsic evaluation in the context of the AMI@Ibereval2018 shared task, where the resource was exploited for extracting domain-specific lexicon-based features for the supervised classification of misogyny in English and Spanish tweets. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

For example, in the US, the probability of a female undergraduate student in computer science to get a PhD is lower than a similar probability for a male student. At first glance, it may seem that in such a situation, if we try to maximize our gain and we have a limited amount of resources, it is reasonable to concentrate on students with the higher probability of success – i.e., on males, and only moral considerations prevent us from pursuing this seemingly economically optimal discriminatory strategy. In this paper, we show that this first impression is wrong: the discriminatory strategy is not only morally wrong, it is also not optimal – and the morally preferable inclusive strategy is actually also economically better. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (HRD-1242122)","Acknowledgments.

Natural Language Processing technologies can help in addressing the negative effects of this development. In this contribution we evaluate a set of classification algorithms on two types of user-generated online content (tweets and Wikipedia Talk comments) in two languages (English and German). The different sets of data we work on were classified towards aspects such as racism, sexism, hatespeech, aggression and personal attacks. While acknowledging issues with inter-annotator agreement for classification tasks using these labels, the focus of this paper is on classifying the data according to the annotated characteristics using several text classification algorithms. For some classification tasks we are able to reach f-scores of up to 81.58. © 2018, The Author(s).","","Classification (of information); Digital communication systems; Natural language processing systems; Automatic classification; Classification algorithm; Classification tasks; Digital communications; Natural languages; On-line communication; On-line contents; Text classification; Text processing","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (03WKP45); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Frauen, BMBF","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments.

The Robbins Report (cmnd 2154 1963) on HE was published in the same year that I went to university. It inaugurated a process of change and educational expansion that was linked to other major social transformations, including feminism. Its effects have been widely felt such that women now participate in education and employment on unprecedented levels. Indeed, it has opened up opportunities for education and employment for women including individual and social mobility. From my study I show how it opened up opportunities for women from both middle class and working class backgrounds to be first-in-the-family to go to university. I will also argue that whilst there have been very welcome changes in education, and HE especially, such that there is a gender balance of undergraduate students in HE, this does not mean that gender equality has been achieved. Patriarchy or hegemonic masculinity in HE is still strongly felt and experienced despite women’s and feminist involvements in academe over the last 50 years. The question remains about how to transform universities to achieve genuine gender equality across all students and academics in HE. © 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Equality; Feminism; Gender; Higher education; Misogyny; Patriarchy","","","","","","","","Equality in Higher Education: Statistical Report 2011 Part 1: Staff and Part 2: Students, (2013); She Figures 2009—Statistics and Indicators on Gender Equality in Science, EUR 23856 EN; World Atlas on Gender Equality in Education, (2012); Bekhradnia B., Male and Female Participation and Progression in Higher Education, (2009); David M.E., Feminism, Gender & Universities, Politics, Passion & Pedagogies, (2014); Willetts D., Robbins Revisited: Bigger and Better Higher Education; Social Market Foundation, (2013); Willetts D., The Pinch: How the Baby Boomers Took Their Children’s Future—And Why they Should Give It Back, (2011); White M., David Willetts Leaves Cabinet. the Guardian; Mooney C., Diversity in Academe the Gender Issue, Section B, (2012); Report of the Committee Appointed by the Prime Minister under the Chairmanship of Lord Robbins 1961-63; Friedan B., The Feminine Mystique; Penguin: Harmondsworth, (1963); Figes E., Patriarchal Attitudes: Women in Society, Stein and Day, (1970); Firestone S., The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution, (1970); Greer G., The Female Eunuch, (1970); Mitchell J., Women E., The Longest Revolution: Essays on Feminism, Literature and Psychoanalysis, (1984); Mitchell J., Women’s Estate; Penguin: Harmondsworth, (1973); Rich A., Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution, (1977); Rowbotham S., Women, Resistance and Revolution, (1972); Rowbotham S., Hidden from History, (1973); Rowbotham S., Women’s Consciousness: Man’s World, (1973); Slaughter S., Rhoades G., Academic Capitalism and the New Economy Markets, State and Higher Education, (2004); Smits R.-J., European Commission (EC) Director General for Research and Innovation, (2012); Bagilhole B., White K., Gender E., Power and Management: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Higher Education, (2011); Bagilhole B., White K., Gender and Generation in Academia, (2013); Harding S., Feminism and Methodology, Indiana University Press, (1987); Morley L., The rules of the game: Women and the leaderist turn in higher education, Gend.

According to ambivalent sexism theory (Glick and Fiske, 1996), it comes in two forms: Hostile and Benevolent. While hostile sexism is characterized by an explicitly negative attitude, benevolent sexism is more subtle. Previous works on computationally detecting sexism present online are restricted to identifying the hostile form. Our objective is to investigate the less pronounced form of sexism demonstrated online. We achieved this by creating and analyzing a dataset of tweets that exhibit benevolent sexism. We classified tweets into 'Hostile', 'Benevolent' or 'Others' class depending on the kind of sexism they exhibit, by using Support Vector Machines (SVM), sequence-to-sequence models and FastText classifier. We achieved the best F1-score using FastText classifier. Our work aims to analyze and understand the much prevalent ambivalent sexism in social media. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Semantics; Support vector machines; Classifieds; F1 scores; Offline; Sequence models; Social media; Support vectors machine; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Abadi Martin, Agarwal Ashish, Barham Paul, Brevdo Eugene, Chen Zhifeng, Citro Craig, Corrado Greg S, Davis Andy, Dean Jeffrey, Devin Matthieu, Et al., Tensorflow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems, (2016); Agarwal Apoorv, Xie Boyi, Vovsha Ilia, Ram-bow Owen, Passonneau Rebecca, Sentiment analysis of twitter data, Proceedings of the workshop on languages in social media, pp. 30-38, (2011); Baccianella Stefano, Esuli Andrea, Sebastiani Fabrizio, Sentiwordnet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining, LREC, 10, pp. 2200-2204, (2010); Bahdanau Dzmitry, Cho Kyunghyun, Bengio Yoshua, Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, (2014); Bargh John A, Raymond Paula, The naive misuse of power: Nonconscious sources of sexual harassment, Journal of Social Issues, 51, 1, pp. 85-96, (1995); Barreto Manuela, Ellemers Naomi, The perils of political correctness: Men's and women's responses to old-fashioned and modern sexist views, Social Psychology Quarterly, 68, 1, pp. 75-88, (2005); Becker Julia C, Wagner Ulrich, Doing gender differently, Womens Internalization of Sexism: Predictors and Antidotes page, (2008); Becker Julia C, Wright Stephen C, Yet another dark side of chivalry: Benevolent sexism undermines and hostile sexism motivates collective action for social change, Journal of personality and social psychology, 101, 1, (2011); Bermingham Adam, Smeaton Alan F, Classifying sentiment in microblogs: is brevity an advantage?, Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management, pp. 1833-1836, (2010); Berscheid Ellen, Snyder Mark, Omoto Allen M, The relationship closeness inventory: Assessing the closeness of interpersonal relationships, Journal of personality and Social Psychology, 57, 5, (1989); Bojanowski Piotr, Grave Edouard, Joulin Armand, Mikolov Tomas, Enriching word vectors with subword information, (2016); Bolukbasi Tolga, Chang Kai-Wei, Zou James Y, Saligrama Venkatesh, Kalai Adam T, Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?

Our classifiers can detect the self-narration of personally experienced racism in online textual accounts with 83% accuracy, and can recognize four types of supportive actions in replies with up to 88% accuracy. Descriptively, our models identify types of racism experienced and the racist concepts (e.g., sexism, appearance or accent related) most experienced by people of different races.

We ran the Sexism Response Workshop for a class of 92 undergraduate students, splitting the students into two groups to make the workshop manageable. The workshop was run by a theater facilitator and was based on Augusto Boal's 'Theater of the Oppressed' methodology. We report how the workshop was conducted, the types of roleplay situations and the responses of the students and observers, as well as written responses of some students who chose to blog about the activity the following week. © 2016 IEEE.","roleplay; sexism; theater of the oppressed","Education; Theaters; Experience report; Role play; sexism; Undergraduate students; Students","","","","","","","Barker L.J., Garvin-Doxas K., Jackson M., Defensive climate in the computer science classroom, ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 34, pp. 43-47, (2002); Cohen-Cruz J., Schutzman M., Playing Boal, (2002); Freire P., Pedagogy of the Oppressed, (2000); Giroux H., Lessons from paulo freire, Chronicle of Higher Education, 57, pp. B15-B16, (2010); Latulipe C., Long N.B., Seminario C.E., Structuring flipped classes with lightweight teams and gamification, Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 392-397, (2015); Maher M.L., Latulipe C., Lipford H., Rorrer A., Flipped classroom strategies for CS education, Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 218-223, (2015); Maruping L.M., Magni M., What's the weather like?

While the racism and sexism of the tweet drew fire, the tweet was also hotly defended by comedians who insisted that it functioned to “expand the boundaries of comedy.” In this essay, the tweet is analyzed as a “discourse knot” to interrogate the intersections of comedic discourse and the construction of Black girlhood in U.S. culture. The study's 2 key findings are that first, purportedly “edgy” comedy can function to sustain social power hierarchies, and second, Black girlhood constitutes an unintelligible subject position in the Foucauldian sense, necessitating rigorous attention, especially with regard to issues of cultural sexualization. © 2015 International Communication Association","Black Girls; Comedy; Intersectionality; Quvenzhané Wallis; Sexualization; The Onion","","","","","","","","Report of the APA Task Force on the sexualization of girls, (2007); Aries P., Centuries of childhood, (1973); Bercovici J., The Onion, apologizes?, (2013); Billig M., Violent racist jokes, Beyond a joke: The limits of humour, pp. 27-46, (2009); Bragg S., Buckingham D., Global concerns, local negotiations and moral selves: Contemporary parenting and the “sexualisation of childhood” debate, Feminist Media Studies, 13, 4, pp. 643-659, (2013); Bragg S., Buckingham D., Russell R., Willett R., Too much, too soon?

The AMI challenge, based on both Italian and English tweets, is distinguished into two subtasks, i.e. Subtask A on misogyny identification and Subtask B about misogynistic behaviour categorization and target classification. Regarding the Italian language, we have received a total of 13 runs for Subtask A and 11 runs for Subtask B. Concerning the English language, we received 26 submissions for Subtask A and 23 runs for Subtask B. The participating systems have been distinguished according to the language, counting 6 teams for Italian and 10 teams for English. We present here an overview of the AMI shared task, the datasets, the evaluation methodology, the results obtained by the participants and a discussion of the methodology adopted by the teams. Finally, we draw some conclusions and discuss future work. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

Tales like the famous Sleeping Beauty clearly divide up gender roles. But what about more modern stories, borne of a generation increasingly aware of social constructs like sexism and racism? Do these stories tend to reinforce gender stereotypes, or counter them? In this paper, we present a technique that combines natural language processing with a crowdsourced lexicon of stereotypes to capture gender biases in fiction. We apply this technique across 1.8 billion words of fiction from the Wattpad online writing community, investigating gender representation in stories, how male and female characters behave and are described, and how authors' use of gender stereotypes is associated with the community's ratings. We find that male over-representation and traditional gender stereotypes (e.g., dominant men and submissive women) are common throughout nearly every genre in our corpus. However, only some of these stereotypes, like sexual or violent men, are associated with highly rated stories. Finally, despite women often being the target of negative stereotypes, female authors are equally likely to write such stereotypes as men. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

With the increase in the use of social media, this feeling of hatred towards women and immigrants can be more easily expressed, therefore it can cause harmful effects on social media users.

Our main contribution is the integration of three individual algorithms of prediction in a model based on Vote ensemble classifier. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Computational linguistics; Semantics; Speech recognition; Ensemble learning; Ensemble-classifier; Harmful effects; Model-based OPC; Social media; Social problems; Social networking (online)","","","","","Spanish Government; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R)","This work has been partially supported by Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) and REDES project (TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R) from the Spanish Government.","Basile Valerio, Bosco Cristina, Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Patti Viviana, Rangel Francisco, Rosso Paolo, Sanguinetti Manuela, Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), (2019); Canos Jose Sebastian, Misogyny identification through svm at ibereval 2018, (2018); Erjavec Karmen, Kovacic Melita Poler, you don't understand, this is a new war!” analysis of hate speech in news web sites' comments, Mass Communication and Society, 15, 6, pp. 899-920, (2012); Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Rosso Paolo, Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (ami), Proceedings of the 6th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian (EVALITA18), (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Anzovino Maria, Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018, (2018); Fortuna Paula, Nunes Sergio, A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51, 4, (2018); Manne Kate, Down girl: The logic of misogyny, (2017); Moraes Rodrigo, Valiati JoaO Francisco, Neto O, Document-level sentiment classification: An empirical comparison between svm and ann, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 2, pp. 621-633, (2013); Pedregosa Fabian, Varoquaux Gael, Gram-fort Alexandre, Michel Vincent, Thirion Bertrand, Grisel Olivier, Blondel Mathieu, Prettenhofer Peter, Weiss Ron, Dubourg Vincent, Et al., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in python, Journal of machine learning research, 12, Oct, pp. 2825-2830, (2011); Sanguinetti Manuela, Poletto Fabio, Bosco Cristina, Patti Viviana, Marco Stranisci, An italian twitter corpus of hate speech against immigrants, Language Resources and Evaluation ConferenceLREC 2018, pp. 1-8, (2018); Tsytsarau Mikalai, Palpanas Themis, Survey on mining subjective data on the web, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 24, 3, pp. 478-514, (2012); Waseem Zeerak, Hovy Dirk, Hateful symbols or hateful people? predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter, Proceedings of the NAACL student research workshop, pp. 88-93, (2016)","","","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX); Microsoft","13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2019, co-located with the 17th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL HLT 2019","6 June 2019 through 7 June 2019","Minneapolis","172737","","978-195073706-2","","","English","NAACL HLT - Int.

The review discusses conventional debates over how to define cyberbullying, arguing to limit the term to repeated, electronically-mediated incidents involving intention to harm and a power imbalance between bully and victim. It also takes note of the critical perspective that cyberbullying- through its generic and individualistic framing-deflects attention from the racism, sexism, ableism, and heterosexism that can motivate or exacerbate the problem of such bullying. The review concludes that: (a) cyberbullying, rigorously defined, is a phenomenon that is less pervasive and dire than widely believed; and (b) cyber-aggression and online harassment are more prevalent, yet understudied. Fueled by various societal inequalities, these latter forms of online abuse require urgent public attention. The chapter's recommendations are informed by a view of young people as apprentice citizens, who learn democratic participation by practicing it. © 2016, IGI Global.

We believe there is an overall lack of awareness how gender stereotypes affect us as individuals, both male and female, and our society as a whole. This paper reports on the opportunities of combining the concepts of Virtual Reality empathy games and sexism to stimulate the development of dispositional empathy and increase awareness about sexism in general. The evaluation shows that Through Pink and Blue Glasses stimulated dispositional empathy (empathy as a character trait). The results show that the experience triggered perspective-taking and the participants' willingness to act in real situations where normally ignorance occurs. This research extends our knowledge of developing games for dispositional empathy and lists design decisions that turned out to be efficient, which can be used for the development of other empathy games. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Empathy; Game design; Interaction design; Sexism","Abstracting; Glass; Interactive computer systems; Virtual reality; Design decisions; Empathy; Game design; Gender stereotypes; Interaction design; Perspective taking; Real situation; Sexism; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Paiva A., Dias J., Sobral D., Aylett R., Woods S., Hall L., Zoll C., Learning by feeling: Evoking empathy with synthetic characters, Applied Artificial Intelligence, 19, 3-4, pp. 235-266, (2005); Gender Swap - Experiment with the Machine to Be Another, (2014); Perry B.D., Szalavitz M., Born for Love: Why Empathy is Essential- and Endangered, (2010); Siebel Newsom J., The Mask You Live, (2015); Stueber K., Measuring Empathy, (2013); Eerkens M., Waarom We Onze Kinderen Moeten Leren Zich in Anderen te Verplaatsen, (2015); Davis M.H., A mulitdimensional approach to individual differences in empathy, JSAS Catalog of Selected Documents in Psychology, 10, 1, (1980); Kors M.J.L., Ferri G., Van Der Spek E.D., Ketel C., Schouten B.A.M., A breathtaking journey.

We evaluate our approach on a publicly available corpus of 16k tweets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison to existing state-of-the-art solutions.

In statements with this subject-complement structure, the item in the complement position serves as the reference point and is thus considered more typical and prominent. This explains why “Tents are like houses,” for instance, sounds better than “Houses are like tents”—people generally think of houses as more typical. For domains about ability, the reference point should be the item that is typically more skilled. We further propose that the reference point should be naturally more skilled. In two experiments, we presented adults with summaries of actual scientific evidence for gender equality in math (Experiment 1) or verbal ability (Experiment 2), but we manipulated whether the reference point in the statements of equality in the summaries (e.g., “Boys’ verbal ability is as good as girls’”) was girls or boys. As predicted, adults attributed more natural ability to each gender when it was in the complement rather than subject position. Yet, in Experiment 3, we found that when explicitly asked, participants judged that such sentences were not biased in favor of either gender, indicating that subject-complement statements must be transmitting this bias in a subtle way. Thus, statements such as “Girls are as good as boys at math” can actually backfire and perpetuate gender stereotypes about natural ability. © 2018 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.","Ability; Gender equality; Inference; Language; Syntax","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cognition; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Middle Aged; Sexism; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; cognition; female; human; language; male; middle aged; sexism; young adult","","","","","","","Banaji M.R., Hardin C., Automatic stereotyping, Psychological Science, 7, pp. 136-141, (1996); Banaji M.R., Hardin C., Rothman A.J., Implicit stereotyping in person judgment, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, pp. 272-281, (1993); Bargh J.A., Chen M., Burrows L., Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, pp. 230-244, (1996); Bian L., Leslie S.-J., Cimpian A., Gender stereotypes about intellectual ability emerge early and influence children's interests, Science, 355, 6323, pp. 389-391, (2017); Bowdle B., Gentner D., Informativity and asymmetry in comparisons, Cognitive Psychology, 3, pp. 244-286, (1997); Bowdle B., Medin D., Reference-point Reasoning and Comparison Asymmetries, Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, pp. 116-121, (2001); Bruckmuller S., Abele A., Comparison focus in intergroup comparisons: Who we compare to whom influences who we see as powerful and agentic, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 36, 10, pp. 1424-1435, (2010); Bruckmuller S., Hegarty P., Abele A., Framing gender differences: Linguistic normativity affects perceptions of power and gender stereotypes, European Journal of Social Psychology, 42, pp. 210-218, (2012); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Model selection and multi-model inference: A practical information-theoretic approach, (2002); Chestnut E.K., Markman E.M., Are horses like zebras, or vice versa?

In this paper, we introduce computer vision to the study of gender politics and present an image-driven method that can measure the effects of gender in an accurate and timely manner. We first collect all the profile images of the candidates’ Twitter followers. Then we train a convolutional neural network using images that contain gender labels. Lastly, we classify all the follower and unfollower images. Through a case study of the ‘woman card’ controversy, we demonstrate how gender is informing the 2016 presidential election. Our framework of analysis can be eadily generalized to other case studies and elections. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Computer vision; Donald trump; Gender politics; Hillary clinton","Behavioral research; Computer vision; Neural networks; Case-studies; Convolutional neural network; Donald trump; Gender politics; Hillary clinton; Presidential election; Social sciences","","","","","","","Brians C.L., Women for Women?

The present study evaluates factors associated with young adult women's online harassment experiences through a multi-factor measure accounting for the frequency and severity of negative events. Findings from a survey of 659 undergraduate and graduate students highlight the relationship between harassment, well-being, and engagement in strategies to manage one's online identity. We further identify differences in harassment experiences across three popular social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We conclude by discussing this study's contribution to feminist theory and describing five potential design interventions derived from our data that may minimize these negative experiences, mitigate the psychological harm they cause, and provide women with more proactive ways to regain agency when using communication technologies.","Cyberbullying; Misogyny; Online harassment; Social media","Computation theory; Computer supported cooperative work; Interactive computer systems; Social networking (online); Students; Communication technologies; Cyber bullying; Information and Communication Technologies; Misogyny; Negative experiences; Online harassment; Social media; Social media platforms; Groupware","","","","","","","Ashktorab Z., Vitak J., Designing cyberbullying mitigation and prevention solutions through participatory design with teenagers, Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3895-3905, (2016); Bernstein M.S., Bakshy E., Burke M., Karrer B., Quantifying the invisible audience in social networks, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 21-30, (2013); Buchanan N.T., Fitzgerald L.F., Effects of racial and sexual harassment on work and the psychological well-being of African American women, Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13, 2, pp. 137-151, (2008); Butler J., Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, (2006); Butler J., Bodily vulnerability, coalitions, and street politics, Critical Studies, 37, pp. 99-119, (2014); Chemaly S., There's no comparing male and female harassment online, Time Magazine, (2014); Citron D.K., Law's expressive value in combating cyber gender harassment, Michigan Law Review, 108, 3, pp. 373-415, (2009); Citron D.K., Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, Harvard University Press, (2014); Crabtree S., Nsubuga F., Women Feel Less Safe Than Men in Many Developed Countries, (2012); Danet B., Text as mask: Gender, Play, and performance on the internet, Cybersociety 2.0, pp. 129-158, (1998); Dimond J.P., Dye M., Larose D., Bruckman A.S., Hollaback!: The role of storytelling online in a social movement organization, Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 477-490, (2013); Dinakar K., Jones B., Havasi C., Lieberman H., Picard R., Common sense reasoning for detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyberbullying, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 2, 3, (2012); Dressing H., Bailer J., Anders A., Wagner H., Gallas C., Cyberstalking in a large sample of social network users: Prevalence, characteristics, and impact upon victims, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 17, 2, pp. 61-67, (2013); Duggan M., Online harassment, Pew Internet Project, Washington, D.

There has been severe pressure on law enforcement agencies to respond to this Internet abuse, commonly called Internet trolling. Equally, there has been demands made of social media companies to better police the content on their platforms. There is also the option of civil action for those who have been targeted by the 'trolls' who post the abusive comments. This paper suggests understanding UK case law in relation to Internet trolling and cyber-harassment should be done through the prism of the French legal concepts of bleasure (i.e. blessure) and motif. The paper provides a framework for those involved in multimedia forensics to abstract information from identified abusive content (i.e. motifs) to determine whether it would be reasonable to say that such messages harmed a person (i.e. caused a bleasure). Using a corpus linguistics approach, the paper identifies abusive posts made against prominent women public figures on Twitter and newsblogs in the last three years, namely Sally Bercow, Caroline Criado-Perez, Esther McVay and Salma Yaqoob. The paper finds that it is possible to systematically abstract data from social media platforms that both show that an offence has happened (i.e. actus reus, motif), that a person has been harmed (i.e. malum reus, bleasure), and whether it has occurred, or is likely to occur, over a longer period of time (i.e. pertinax reus). This can be done using 'interface cues' in the form of authority cues and bandwagon cues, which need to rely on an effective corpus of key terms to be useful.

Since this mode of communication loses none of the socio-cultural complexity that shapes face-to-face communication, gender and sexism is an important factor. We studied three student teams in an international classroom setting that used computer-mediated communication to collaborate on an IT project. Through the analysis of their chat logs we gained insights into the students' gendered and gendering interactions. We found indicators of sexism and noticed that both male and female students were using gendered language.

However, prospective users' viewpoints have been absent from the debate over the socially acceptable bounds of nonmedical sex selection. This qualitative study provides a set of empirically grounded perspectives on the moral values that underpin prospective users' conceptualizations of justice in the context of a family balancing program in the United States. The results indicate that couples pursuing family balancing understand justice primarily in individualist and familial terms rather than in terms of social justice for women and girls or for children resulting from sex selection. Study participants indicated that an individual's desire for gender balance in their family is ethically complex and may not be inherently sexist, immoral, or socially consequential, particularly given the social context in which they live. Our findings suggest that the social conditions that contribute to prospective users' desires for gender balance in their families may direct them away from recognizing or engaging broader social justice concerns relating to sexism and stratified reproduction. © The Author(s) 2012.","ethics; family balancing; gender; justice; nonmedical sex selection","","","","","","National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI, (P50 HG003390)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (P50 HG003390).

Based on the collection and analysis of discourse on gender and sexism within this movement over a six-year period. I suggest three possible causes: (a) some geek identities can be narrow and unappealing; (b) open communities are especially susceptible to difficult people; and, (c) the ideas of freedom and openness can be used to dismiss concerns and rationalize the gender gap as a matter of preference and choice.","","","","","","","","","(2012); Antin J., Yee R., Cheshire C., Nov O., Gender differences in Wikipedia editing, pp. 11-14, (2011); Aurora V., (2010); Aurora V., (2002); Blum L., Frieze C., Hazzan O., Dias M.B., Cultural perspective on gender diversity in computing, Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Current Issues in Computing and Philosophy, (2008); Bosker B., Ruchi Sanghvi, Facebook's first female engineer: 'It was difficult to break into the boys' club, (2011); brogramming: How does a programmer become a brogrammer?, (2012); Bucholtz M., Geek feminism, (2002); Bury R., She's geeky: The performance of identity among women working in IT, 3, 1, (2011); Byfield B., Sexism: Open source software's dirty little secret, (2009); Byfield B., Writing about FOSS sexism, (2009); Carter D., Brogrammers,' 'hogrammers,' and the gender gap in college computer courses, (2012); Cheryan S., Plaut V.C., Davies P.G., Steele C.M., Ambient belonging: How stereotypical cues impact gender participation in computer science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 97, 6, pp. 1045-1060, (2009); Clark-Flory T., Female programmers on 'The Social Network', (2010); Cohen N., Define gender gap?
