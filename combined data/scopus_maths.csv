The user has freedom to post whatever he/she likes in social networking and blogging sites. However, sometimes the content when directed towards certain group of individuals with an intention to incite hate or discrimination, causes a turmoil in the society. Such content is known as hate speech. Hate speech can be a serious problem to peace and harmony in the society. There are instances where hate speech have led to social unrest and extremism. Thus, hate speech in the internet needs to be monitored. In this paper, we discuss the relevant works done in the field of hate speech detection. Different types of hate speech like racism, sexism, religious hate speech, etc. and the various methods proposed to tackle them are discussed. Further, we identify the challenges and propose the solutions to challenges in hate speech detection in the public internet sphere.  © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Racism; Sexism","Natural language processing systems; Speech; Blogging; Common platform; Internet needs; NAtural language processing; Public internet; Speech detection; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Ghimire A., Thapa S., Jha A.K., Adhikari S., Kumar A., Accelerating business growth with big data and artificial intelligence, 2020 Fourth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 441-448, (2020); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Cyber hate speech on twitter: An application of machine classification and statistical modeling for policy and decision making, Policy & Internet, 7, 2, pp. 223-242, (2015); Del Vigna F., Cimino A., Dell'Orletta F., Petrocchi M., Tesconi M., Hate me, hate me not: Hate speech detection on facebook, Proceedings of the First Italian Conference on Cybersecurity (ITASEC17), pp. 86-95, (2017); Banks J., Regulating hate speech online, International Review of Law, Computers & Technology, 24, 3, pp. 233-239, (2010); The Number of Tweets per Day in, (2020); Adhikari S., Thapa S., Singh P., Huo A., Bharathy G., Prasad M., A comparative study of machine learning and nlp techniques for uses of stop words by patients in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 1-8, (2021); Thapa S., Adhikari S., Ghimire A., Aditya A., Feature selection based twin-support vector machine for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, 2020 IEEE 8th R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC), (2020); Malmasi S., Zampieri M., Detecting Hate Speech in Social Media, (2017); Cao R., Lee R.K.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 11-20, (2020); Park J.H., Fung P., One-step and Two-step Classification for Abusive Language Detection on Twitter, (2017); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 11, 1, (2017); Founta A., Et al., Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of twitter abusive behavior, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 12, 1, (2018); Gamback B., Sikdar U.K., Using convolutional neural networks to classify hate-speech, Proceedings of the First Workshop on Abusive Language Online, pp. 85-90, (2017); De Gibert O., Perez N., Garcia-Pablos A., Cuadros M., Hate Speech Dataset from A White Supremacy Forum, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people. predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter, Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pp. 88-93, (2016); Pitsilis G.K., Ramampiaro H., Langseth H., Effective hate-speech detection in twitter data using recurrent neural networks, Applied Intelligence, 48, 12, pp. 4730-4742, (2018); Bartlett J., Reffin J., Rumball N., Williamson S., Anti-social media, Demos, 2014, pp. 1-51, (2014); Calderon C.A., De La Vega G., Herrero D.B., Topic modeling and characterization of hate speech against immigrants on twitter around the emergence of a far-right party in Spain, Social Sciences, 9, 11, (2020); Warner W., Hirschberg J., Detecting hate speech on the world wide web, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Language in Social Media, pp. 19-26, (2012); Basile V., Et al., Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter, 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63, (2019); Albadi N., Kurdi M., Mishra S., Are they our brothers.

They were chosen because of their intersecting semantic definitions and popularity in social media. In order to analyze the meaning of the mentioned hashtags, 539 544 tweets were analyzed. Each tweet from the studied group contained one of the mentioned hashtags. The purpose of the analysis was to examine the semantic interrelationships and to analyze sentiment to determine the interrelationships among the selected hashtags. The results obtained indicate that the hashtags studied vary in meaning in the tweets analyzed and are used in different contexts. The analysis of social media data allows us to model the relationship between different constructs and provides an important source of knowledge about society. The results obtained allowed us to extract those elements that are common to the analyzed data and those that are unique. Sentiment analysis was also conducted. Based on the different analyses, a relational model was developed and tested for 5 hashtags. Satisfactory results were obtained for 3 hashtags, allowing hashtag detection without knowledge of the hashtag for the text being analyzed. © ESM 2021.

This paper describes our system for Task 5 of SemEval-2022: Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI). We participated in both the sub-tasks, where we used transformer-based architecture to combine features of images and text. We explore models with multi-modal pre-training (VisualBERT) and text-based pretraining (MMBT) while drawing comparative results.

Applications regarding a state-of-the-art workplace sexism detection model include aids for Human Resources departments, AI chatbots and sentiment analysis. Most existing hate speech detection methods, although robust and accurate, focus on hate speech found on social media, specifically Twitter. The context of social media is much more anonymous than the workplace, therefore it tends to lend itself to more aggressive and “hostile” versions of sexism. Therefore, datasets with large amounts of “hostile” sexism have a slightly easier detection task since “hostile” sexist statements can hinge on a couple words that, regardless of context, tip the model off that a statement is sexist. In this paper we present a dataset of sexist statements that are more likely to be said in the workplace as well as a deep learning model that can achieve state-of-the art results. Previous research has created state-of-the-art models to distinguish “hostile” and “benevolent” sexism based simply on aggregated Twitter data. Our deep learning methods, initialized with GloVe or random word embeddings, use LSTMs with attention mechanisms to outperform those models on a more diverse, filtered dataset that is more targeted towards workplace sexism, leading to an F1 score of 0.88. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Attention mechanism; Hate speech; LSTM; Natural Language Processing; Sexism; Workplace","Biomimetics; Deep learning; Large dataset; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Attention mechanisms; Automatic Detection; Classification tasks; Detection models; Detection tasks; Learning methods; Speech detection; State of the art; Data mining","","","","","ISEP; Stanford University, SU","Supported by Stanford University and ISEP.","Aarons E., Ada Hegerberg: First Women’s Ballon d’Or Marred as Winner is Asked to Twerk. the Guardian, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, International Conference on Learning Representations, (2015); Bolukbasi T., Et al., Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?

Due to the different karyotypes and the effects of X chromosome inactivation, females and males exhibit distinct methylation patterns on sex chromosomes; thus, it poses a significant challenge to normalize sex chromosome data without introducing bias. Currently, existing methods do not provide unbiased solutions to normalize sex chromosome data, usually, they just process autosomal and sex chromosomes indiscriminately. Results: Here, we demonstrate that ignoring this sex difference will lead to introducing artificial sex bias, especially for thousands of autosomal CpGs. We present a novel two-step strategy (interpolatedXY) to address this issue, which is applicable to all quantile-based normalization methods. By this new strategy, the autosomal CpGs are first normalized independently by conventional methods, such as funnorm or dasen; then the corrected methylation values of sex chromosome-linked CpGs are estimated as the weighted average of their nearest neighbors on autosomes. The proposed two-step strategy can also be applied to other non-quantile-based normalization methods, as well as other array-based data types. Moreover, we propose a useful concept: the sex explained fraction of variance, to quantitatively measure the normalization effect.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, very little has been written about the faculty leading these gender-based initiatives, most of whom are women. This dynamic—women advocating on behalf of other women—is connected to identity-based activist movements. In the following, I describe how I have started to see gender-based work in STEM as a form of institutional activism. I then describe how this change of conceptualization led me to rethink the landscape of gender-based work in STEM. I reflect on literature from institutional activism and describe how that literature has changed my own engagement in gender-based service. My goal in this article is to provide math practitioners with some ideas for reflecting on their own actions in contesting historical forms of sexism. As we begin to understand the rules, norms, and cultures that constrain us, we will be better equipped to strategically contest them and create the sorts of institutional change that we want to see. I conclude the article with a series of questions to challenge all of us to think strategically about the future of our work supporting women in STEM. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","faculty service;

We design an experiment, set the gender and productivity of an actor or actress in a certain period as the independent variables, and introduce deep learning techniques to do the prediction of success, extract the latent features, and understand the data we use. Three models have been trained: the first one is trained by the data of an actor, the second one is trained by the data of an actress, and the third one is trained by the mixed data. Three benchmark models are constructed with the same conditions. The experiment results show that our models are more general and accurate than benchmarks. An interesting finding is that the models trained by the data of an actor/actress only achieve similar performance on the data of another gender without performance loss. It shows that the gender bias is weakly related to success. Through the visualization of the feature maps in the embedding space, we see that prediction models have learned some common laws although they are trained by different data. Using the above findings, a more general and accurate model to predict the success in show business can be built. © 2020 Chong Wu et al.","","Female; Humans; Male; Sexism; Data visualization; Deep learning; Forecasting; Accurate modeling; Benchmark models; Feature map; Independent variables; Learning techniques; Performance loss; Prediction model; Three models; female; human; male; sexism; Predictive analytics","","","","","","","Williams O.E., Lacasa L., Latora V., Quantifying and predicting success in show business, Nature Communications, 10, 1, pp. 1-8, (2019); Petersen A.M., Jung W.-S., Yang J.-S., Stanley H.E., Quantitative and empirical demonstration of the matthew effect in a study of career longevity, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108, 1, pp. 18-23, (2011); Janosov M., Battiston F., Sinatra R., Success and luck in creative careers, EPJ Data Science, 9, 1, (2020); Easley D., Kleinberg J., Networks, crowds, and markets: reasoning about a highly connected world, Significance, 9, pp. 43-44, (2012); Barabasi A.-L., The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success, (2018); Fraiberger S.P., Sinatra R., Resch M., Riedl C., Barabasi A.-L., Quantifying reputation and success in art, Science, 362, 6416, pp. 825-829, (2018); Juhasz S., Toth G.O., Lengyel B., Brokering the core and the periphery: creative success and collaboration networks in the film industry, PLoS One, 15, 2, (2020); Wu L., Wang D., Evans J.A., Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology, Nature, 566, 7744, pp. 378-382, (2019); Moreno B., Ciotti V., Panzarasa P., Liverani S., Lacasa L., Latora V., Predicting success in the worldwide start-up network, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, pp. 1-6, (2020); Sinatra R., Wang D., Deville P., Song C., Barabasi A.-L., Quantifying the evolution of individual scientific impactfic impact, Science, 354, 6312, (2016); Hirsch J.E., An index to quantify an individual's scientific research output, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 102, 46, pp. 16569-16572, (2005); Kozbelt A., One-hit wonders in classical music: evidence and (partial) explanations for an early career peak, Creativity Research Journal, 20, 2, pp. 179-195, (2008); Simonton D.K., Creative productivity: a predictive and explanatory model of career trajectories and landmarks, Psychological Review, 104, 1, pp. 66-89, (1997); Lehman H.C., Age and Achievement, (2017); Simonton D.K., Age and outstanding achievement: what do we know after a century of research?, Psychological Bulletin, 104, 2, pp. 251-267, (1988); Spitz A., Horvat E.-A., Measuring long-term impact based on network centrality: unraveling cinematic citations, PLoS One, 9, 10, (2014); Acuna D.E., Allesina S., Kording K.P., Predicting scientific success, Nature, 489, 7415, pp. 201-202, (2012); Penner O., Pan R.K., Petersen A.M., Kaski K., Fortunato S., On the predictability of future impact in science, Scientific Reports, 3, 1, pp. 1-8, (2013); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-term memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Voelker A., Kajic I., Eliasmith C., Legendre memory units: continuous-time representation in recurrent neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 15544-15553, (2019); Graves A., Mohamed A.-R., Hinton G., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks, pp. 6645-6649; Huang J., Zhou W., Zhang Q., Li H., Li W., Video-based sign language recognition without temporal segmentation; Wang L., Duan X., Zhang Q., Niu Z., Hua G., Zheng N., Segment-tube: spatio-temporal action localization in untrimmed videos with per-frame segmentation, Sensors, 18, 5, (2018); Duan X., Wang L., Zhai C., Joint spatiotemporal action localization in untrimmed videos with per-frame segmentation, pp. 918-922; Orsini F., Gastaldi M., Mantecchini L., Rossi R., Neural networks trained with WiFi traces to predict airport passenger behavior, pp. 1-7","","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","16875265","","","32695154","English","Comput.

They were shown a picture of either a young or old woman or man and asked to assess the likelihood that this person would use a desktop computer, laptop computer and a smartphone, and their level of expertise in each of these technologies. The results showed that the students did have negative perceptions of the older people in comparison to young people. They also thought that women were less expert with the technologies than men, although there was no difference in the likelihood of them using the technology. However, there was no evidence of a “double standard” of older women being perceived particularly negatively. © The Author(s) 2018.","Ageism; Perceptions of older people; Perceptions of older women; Perceptions of technology expertise; Perceptions of technology use; Sexism","Laptop computers; Ageism; Computer science students; Computer scientists; Older People; Sexism; Technology use; Young peoples; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Chase C., An intergenerational e-mail pal project of attitudes of college students toward older adults, Educ.

Filtering such information from social media is of paramount importance to achieving this goal. In this paper, we describe the system developed by our team for SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification. We propose a multimodal training methodology that achieves good performance on both the sub-tasks, ranking 4th for Subtask A (0.718 macro F1-score) and 9th for Subtask B (0.695 macro F1-score) while exceeding the baseline results by good margins.

The task is designed to detect and classify misogynous memes. To utilize both textual and visual information presented in a meme, we investigate several of the most recent visual-language transformer-based multimodal models and choose ERNIE-ViL-Large as our base model. For subtask A, with observations of models' overfitting on unimodal patterns, strategies are proposed to mitigate problems of biased words and template memes. For subtask B, we transform this multi-label problem into a multi-class one and experiment with oversampling and complementary techniques. Our approach places 2nd for subtask A and 5th for subtask B in this competition. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Semantics; Base models; Multi-label problems; Multi-modal; Multimodal models; Overfitting; Oversampling technique; Subtask; Textual information; Unimodal; Visual information; Visual languages","","","","","","","Chen Yen-Chun, Li Linjie, Yu Licheng, El Kholy Ahmed, Ahmed Faisal, Gan Zhe, Cheng Yu, Liu Jingjing, Uniter: Universal image-text representation learning, European conference on computer vision, pp. 104-120, (2020); Das Abhishek, Wahi Japsimar Singh, Li Siyao, Detecting hate speech in multi-modal memes, (2020); Duggan Maeve, Online harassment 2017, (2017); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Godoy Daniela, Tommasel Antonela, Is my model biased? exploring unintended bias in misogyny detection tasks, (2021); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Li Liunian Harold, Yatskar Mark, Yin Da, Hsieh Cho-Jui, Chang Kai-Wei, Visualbert: A simple and performant baseline for vision and language, (2019); Li Xiujun, Yin Xi, Li Chunyuan, Zhang Pengchuan, Hu Xiaowei, Zhang Lei, Wang Lijuan, Hu Houdong, Dong Li, Wei Furu, Et al., Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language tasks, European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 121-137, (2020); Loper Edward, Bird Steven, Nltk: The natural language toolkit, (2002); Lu Jiasen, Batra Dhruv, Parikh Devi, Lee Stefan, Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks, Advances in neural information processing systems, 32, (2019); Muennighoff Niklas, Vilio: state-of-the-art visio-linguistic models applied to hateful memes, (2020); Nozza Debora, Volpetti Claudia, Fersini Elisabetta, Unintended bias in misogyny detection, Ieee/wic/acm international conference on web intelligence, pp. 149-155, (2019); Tan Hao, Bansal Mohit, Lxmert: Learning cross-modality encoder representations from transformers, (2019); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2017); Vedaldi Andrea, Lenc Karel, Matconvnet: Convolutional neural networks for matlab, Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia, pp. 689-692, (2015); Velioglu Riza, Rose Jewgeni, Detecting hate speech in memes using multimodal deep learning approaches: Prize-winning solution to hateful memes challenge, (2020); Xu Kelvin, Ba Jimmy, Kiros Ryan, Cho Kyunghyun, Courville Aaron, Salakhudinov Ruslan, Zemel Rich, Bengio Yoshua, Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention, International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, (2015); Yu Fei, Tang Jiji, Yin Weichong, Sun Yu, Tian Hao, Wu Hua, Wang Haifeng, Ernievil: Knowledge enhanced vision-language representations through scene graph, (2020); Yu Zhou, Cui Yuhao, Yu Jun, Wang Meng, Tao Dacheng, Tian Qi, Deep multimodal neural architecture search, Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 3743-3752, (2020); Zhang Shengyu, Jiang Tan, Wang Tan, Kuang Kun, Zhao Zhou, Zhu Jianke, Yu Jin, Yang Hongxia, Wu Fei, Devlbert: Learning deconfounded visio-linguistic representations, Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 4373-4382, (2020); Zhu Ron, Enhance multimodal transformer with external label and in-domain pretrain: Hateful meme challenge winning solution, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

Multimedia automatic misogyny recognition consists of the identification of misogynous memes, taking advantage of both text and images as sources of information. The task will be organized around two main subtasks: Task A is a binary classification task, which should be identified either as misogynous or not misogynous. Task B is a multi-label classification task, in which the types of misogyny should be identified in potential overlapping categories, such as stereotype, shaming, objectification, and violence. In this paper, we proposed a system based on multitask learning for multi-modal misogynous detection in memes. Our system combined image features with text features to train a multi-label classification. The prediction results were obtained by the simple weighted average method of the results with different fusion models, and the results of Task A were corrected by Task B.

With our best performing models, we were able to achieve rank 5 th and 10 th on sub-tasks A and B respectively. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","'current; Linguistic Modelling; Model ensembles; Modeling task; Pre-training; Subtask; Transfer learning","","","","","","","Afridi Tariq Habib, Alam Aftab, Khan Muhammad Numan, Khan Jawad, Lee Young-Koo, A multimodal memes classification: A survey and open research issues, (2020); Anderson Peter, He Xiaodong, Buehler Chris, Teney Damien, Johnson Mark, Gould Stephen, Zhang Lei, Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering, (2018); Chen Yen-Chun, Li Linjie, Yu Licheng, Kholy Ahmed El, Ahmed Faisal, Gan Zhe, Cheng Yu, Liu Jingjing, Uniter: Universal image-text representation learning, (2020); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Drakett Jessica, Rickett Bridgette, Day Katy, Milnes Kate, Old jokes, new media - online sexism and constructions of gender in internet memes, Feminism & Psychology, 28, 1, pp. 109-127, (2018); Fasoli Fabio, Carnaghi Andrea, Paladino Maria Paola, Social acceptability of sexist derogatory and sexist objectifying slurs across contexts, Language Sciences, 52, pp. 98-107, (2015); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Gasparini Francesca, Erba Ilaria, Fersini Elisabetta, Corchs Silvia, Multimodal classification of sexist advertisements, (2018); Gupta Kshitij, Gautam Devansh, Mamidi Radhika, Volta at SemEval-2021 task 6: Towards detecting persuasive texts and images using textual and multimodal ensemble, Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021), pp. 1075-1081, (2021); Gururangan Suchin, Marasovic Ana, Swayamdipta Swabha, Lo Kyle, Beltagy Iz, Downey Doug, Smith Noah A., Don't stop pretraining: Adapt language models to domains and tasks, Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 8342-8360, (2020); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, (2021); Krishna Ranjay, Zhu Yuke, Groth Oliver, Johnson Justin, Hata Kenji, Kravitz Joshua, Chen Stephanie, Kalantidis Yannis, Li Li-Jia, Shamma David A, Et al., Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations, International journal of computer vision, 123, 1, pp. 32-73, (2017); Li Xiujun, Yin Xi, Li Chunyuan, Zhang Pengchuan, Hu Xiaowei, Zhang Lei, Wang Lijuan, Hu Houdong, Dong Li, Wei Furu, Choi Yejin, Gao Jianfeng, Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language tasks, (2020); Liu Yinhan, Ott Myle, Goyal Naman, Du Jingfei, Joshi Mandar, Chen Danqi, Levy Omer, Lewis Mike, Zettlemoyer Luke, Stoyanov Veselin, Roberta: A robustly optimized bert pretraining approach, (2019); Pamungkas Endang Wahyu, Cignarella Alessandra Teresa, Basile Valerio, Patti Viviana, Et al., 14-exlab@ unito for ami at ibereval2018: Exploiting lexical knowledge for detecting misogyny in english and spanish tweets, 3rd Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages, IberEval 2018, 2150, pp. 234-241, (2018); Ren Shaoqing, He Kaiming, Girshick Ross, Sun Jian, Faster r-cnn: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks, (2016); Siddiqi Nasrina, Bains Anjuman, Mushtaq Arbaaz, Aleem Sheema, Analyzing threads of sexism in new age humour: A content analysis of internet memes, Indian Journal of Social Research, 59, 3, pp. 355-367, (2018)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

This is often done by fitting a restricted mean model for the outcome, as in generalized linear models (GLMs) and in generalized estimating equations (GEEs). If the covariates are high-dimensional, then it may be difficult to well specify the model. This is an important concern, since model misspecification may lead to biased estimates. Doubly robust estimation is an estimation technique that offers some protection against model misspecification. It utilizes two models, one for the outcome and one for the exposure, and produces unbiased estimates of the exposure-outcome association if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Despite its obvious appeal, doubly robust estimation is not used on a regular basis in applied epidemiologic research. One reason for this could be the lack of up-to-date software. In this paper we describe a new R package, drgee, which carries out doubly robust estimation in restricted mean models. The package is constructed to be user-friendly and fast, to facilitate routine use of doubly robust estimation. The paper is structured into theory sections and example sections. The former are intended to serve as a brief but self-consistent tutorial in doubly robust estimation. The latter illustrate the use of the drgee package through practical examples. We have used publically available data throughout the paper, so that the reader can easily replicate all examples. © 2015 by De Gruyter.","confounding; doubly robust estimation; generalized estimating equation; generalized linear model; mediation","air pollution; algorithm; Article; epidemiology; ethnicity; income; maternal smoking; priority journal; response variable; sexism; statistical concepts; statistical model; wheezing","","","","","","","Bang H., Robins J., Doubly robust estimation in missing data and causal inference models, Biometrics, 61, pp. 962-973, (2005); Fox J., Weisberg S., An R Companion to Applied Regression, (2011); Hojsgaard S., Halekoh U., Yan J., The R package geepack for generalized estimating equations, Journal of Statistical Software, 15, pp. 1-11, (2006); Newey W., McFadden D., Large sample estimation and hypothesis testing, Handbook of Econometrics, 4, pp. 2111-2245, (1994); Robins J., Mark S., Newey W., Estimating exposure effects by modelling the expectation of exposure conditional on confounders, Biometrics, 48, pp. 479-495, (1992); Robins J., Rotnitzky A., Comment on inference for semiparametric models: Some questions and an answer, by Bickel and Kwon, Statistica Sinica, 11, pp. 920-936, (2001); Tchetgen Tchetgen E., Robins J., Rotnitzky A., On doubly robust estimation in a semiparametric odds ratio model, Biometrika, 97, pp. 171-180, (2010); Tchetgen Tchetgen E., Rotnitzky A., Double-robust estimation of an exposure-outcome odds ratio adjusting for confounding in cohort and case-control studies, Statistics in Medicine, 30, pp. 335-347, (2011); Valeri L., Vander Weele T., Mediation analysis allowing for exposure-mediator interactions and causal interpretation: Theoretical assumptions and implementation with SAS and SPSS macros, Psychological Methods, 18, (2013); Zetterqvist J., Sjolander A., Drgee: Doubly robust generalized estimating equations, Version 1.1.3, (2015)","A.

Therefore, the filtering of illegal content such as gender discrimination is essential to maintain a healthy social network environment. In this paper, we describe the system developed by our team for SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification. More specifically, we introduce two novel systems to analyze these posts: a multimodal multi-task learning architecture that combines Bertweet for text encoding with ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) for image representation, and a single-flow transformer structure which combines text embeddings from BERT-Embeddings and image embeddings from several different modules such as EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). In this manner, we show that the information behind them can be properly revealed.

It first introduces conceptual metaphor theory, followed by a discussion of more recent developments, notably the notion of metaphor scenarios and the links between metaphor and ideology. The chapter then reviews existing work on metaphor and sexuality in different languages, arguing that one function of metaphors for sexuality is to organise gender relations, including those that are characterised by power asymmetry. The chapter finishes with a brief case study of metaphors for sexuality in the so-called ‘manosphere’, a loose online network of fora and websites that is made up of various groups and is notable for its members’ misogyny and reactionary views of gender relations. It will be argued that the violent and dehumanising metaphors for sexual activity and partners that can be found in the manosphere represent a difference in degree, not kind, from more mainstream metaphors. As such, they represent an extreme case of metaphor’s potential to limit and distort understandings of sexuality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","","","","","","","Baider F., Gesuato S., Masculinist metaphors, feminist research, Metaphorik.

Ideally, a chatbot is void of racism, sexism, or any other offensive speech, however several well-known public instances indicate otherwise (e.g., Microsoft Taybot). In this paper, we explore the mechanisms of how open source conversational chatbots can learn bias, and we investigate potential solutions to mitigate this learned bias. To this end, we developed the Chatbot Bias Assessment Framework to measure bias in conversational chatbots, and then we devised an approach based on counter-stereotypic imagining to reduce this bias. This approach is non-intrusive to the chatbot, since it does not require altering any AI code or deleting any data from the original training dataset.  © 2022 IEEE.","AI; chatbot; ethics; NLP","Chatbots; Humaninteraction; Learn+; MicroSoft; Non-intrusive; Open-source; Training dataset","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (281301)","","Vincent J., Twitter taught Microsoft's AI Chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day, (2016); Han X., Et al., Designing Efective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging, ACM CHI Virtual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2021); Srivastava B., Et al., Personalized Chatbot Trustworthiness Ratings, IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society, 4, (2020); Zhong S., Et al., How To Evaluate Single-Round Dialogues Like Humans: An Information-Oriented Metric, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 28, (2020); Srivastava B., Et al., Rating AI systems for bias to promote trustable applications, IBM Journal of Research and Development, 63, 4-5, (2019); Hanu L., Et al., How AI is Learning to Identify Toxic Online Content, Scientific American Online, (2021); Chatterbot, Github; Shekhar A., Chatbot Using Deep Learning in Python, CodeSpeedy; Chai Y., Et al., How to Keep an Online Learning Chatbot from Being Corrupted, IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, (2020); Treml F., How to Test a Chatbot - Part 1: Why is it so Hard?, Chatbot Magazine, (2018); Fauzia M., Fact Check"" Facebook didn't pull the plug on two chatbots because they created a language, USA Today, (2021); McKay T., No, Facebook Did Not Panic and Shut Down an AI Program That Was Getting Dangerously Smart; Kempf A., If We Are Going to Talk About Implicit Race Bias, We Need to Talk About Structural Racism: Moving Beyond Ubiquity and Inevitability in Teaching and Learning About Race, Taboo: The Journal of Culture and Education, 19, 2, (2020); Khan A., Why is Education Industry opting for AI Chatbots?

These memes although seemingly innocuous have transcended the boundary of online harassment against women and created an unwanted bias against them. To help alleviate this problem, we propose an early fusion model for the prediction and identification of misogynistic memes and their type in this paper for which we participated in SemEval-2022 Task 5. The model receives as input meme image with its text transcription with a target vector. Given that a key challenge with this task is the combination of different modalities to predict misogyny, our model relies on pre-trained contextual representations from different state-of-the-art transformer-based language models and pre-trained image pre-trained models to get an effective image representation. Our model achieved competitive results on both SubTask-A and SubTask-B with the other competing teams and significantly outperforms the baselines. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Semantics; Early fusion; Fusion model; Graph networks; Image representations; Language model; New forms; State of the art; Subtask; Target vectors; Image representation","","","","","","","Cer Daniel, Yang Yinfei, Kong Sheng-yi, Hua Nan, Limtiaco Nicole, St. John Rhomni, Constant Noah, Guajardo-Cespedes Mario, Yuan Steve, Tar Chris, Strope Brian, Kurzweil Ray, Universal sentence encoder for English, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations, pp. 169-174, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); He Kaiming, Zhang Xiangyu, Ren Shaoqing, Sun Jian, Deep residual learning for image recognition, 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 770-778, (2016); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Liu Shuying, Deng Weihong, Very deep convolutional neural network based image classification using small training sample size, 2015 3rd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR), pp. 730-734, (2015); Lu Jiasen, Batra Dhruv, Parikh Devi, Lee Stefan, Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks, Advances in neural information processing systems, 32, (2019); Minaee Shervin, Kalchbrenner Nal, Cambria Erik, Nikzad Narjes, Chenaghlu Meysam, Gao Jianfeng, Deep learning-based text classification: A comprehensive review, ACM Comput.

They often appear to be amusing, evoking and attractive to audiences. However, some memes containing malicious content can be harmful to targeted groups. In this paper, we study misogynous meme detection, a shared task in SemEval 2022 - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI). The challenge of misogynous meme detection is to co-represent multi-modal features. To tackle with this challenge, we propose a Multi-modal Multi-task Variational AutoEncoder (MMVAE) to learn an effective co-representation of visual and textual features in the latent space. Our goal is to automatically determine if a meme contains misogynous information and then identify its fine-grained category. Our model achieves F1 scores of 0.723 on the MAMI sub-task A and 0.634 on sub-task B. We carry out comprehensive experiments on our model's architecture and show that our approach significantly outperforms several strong uni-modal and multi-modal approaches.

We address the two tasks: Task A consists of identifying whether a meme is misogynous. If so, Task B attempts to identify its kind among shaming, stereotyping, objectification, and violence. Our approach combines a BERT Transformer with CLIP for the textual and visual representations. Both textual and visual encoders are fused in an early-fusion fashion through a Multimodal Bidirectional Transformer with unimodally pretrained components. Our official submissions obtain macro-averaged F1=0.727 in Task A (4th position out of 69 participants) and weighted F1=0.710 in Task B (4th position out of 42 participants). © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Early fusion; Fine grained; Multi-modal; Textual representation; Visual representations; Semantics","","","","","Mater Studiorum-Universita  di Bologna, (2021-15854, DOT1303118)","A.

In view of the growing number of experiences of sexism reported online, categorizing these recollections automatically can assist the fight against sexism, as it can facilitate effective analyses by gender studies researchers and government officials involved in policy making. In this paper, we investigate the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we work with considerably more categories of sexism than any published work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we propose a multi-task approach for fine-grained multi-label sexism classification that leverages several supporting tasks without incurring any manual labeling cost. Unlabeled accounts of sexism are utilized through unsupervised learning to help construct our multi-task setup. We also devise objective functions that exploit label correlations in the training data explicitly. Multiple proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art for multi-label sexism classification on a recently released dataset across five standard metrics. © 2020 COLING 2020 - 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference.

Hateful contents may be expressed through popular communication tools, like memes. A meme is an image characterised by a pictorial content with an overlaying text introduced a posteriori, and its main aim is originally to be funny and/or ironic. However, the use of memes to convey misogynous messages has increased and thus an automatic detection of these contents seems to be necessary to counteract this phenomenon. This task is particularly challenging, having that (1) different memes can present the same image, but different texts and vice versa, (2) two memes with the same image but different texts can convey a misogynous and not misogynous message, respectively, (3) misogyny can be expressed by image alone, text alone or their combination. In this paper both unimodal and multimodal approaches are investigated whose classifiers are trained and tested on a dataset of in the wild memes, which present both experts and perceived labels. The proposed multimodal approach provides better results compared to the unimodal ones and the VisualBERT state-of-the-art benchmark. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Image processing; Memes; Misogyny detection; Multimodal classifier; Natural language processing","Classification (of information); Natural language processing systems; Images processing; Language processing; Meme; Misogyny detection; Multi-modal approach; Multimodal classifiers; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Social media platforms; Unimodal; Image classification","","","","","","","Afridi T.H., Alam A., Khan M.N., Khan J., Lee Y.K., A multimodal memes classification: A survey and open research issues, The Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Smart City Applications, pp. 1451-1466, (2020); Bianco S., Gasparini F., Schettini R., Adaptive skin classification using face and body detection, IEEE Trans.

This research investigated whether there was evidence of sexism in the way VoIP compresses vocal data. This was accomplished by measuring the similarity of a large database of vocal samples between their original and compressed forms and statistically comparing their differences between females and males.

In this paper, we describe the system proposed by the MilaNLP team for the Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI) challenge. We use Perceiver IO as a multimodal late fusion over unimodal streams to address both sub-tasks A and B. We build unimodal embeddings using Vision Transformer (image) and RoBERTa (text transcript). We enrich the input representation using face and demographic recognition, image captioning, and detection of adult content and web entities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use Perceiver IO combining text and image modalities. The proposed approach outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Embeddings; Image captioning; Image detection; Image modality; Late fusion; Multi-modal; Subtask; Unimodal; Web entities; Semantics","","","","","MONICA; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Politecnico di Torino, POLITO; European Research Council, ERC; Fondazione Cariplo, (2020-4288); Horizon 2020, (949944)","Funding text 1: This project has partially received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 949944, INTEGRATOR), and by Fondazione Cariplo (grant No. 2020-4288, MONICA).

The task has been organised in two related sub-tasks: the first one is focused on recognising whether a meme is misogynous or not (Sub-task A), while the second one is devoted to recognising types of misogyny (Sub-task B). MAMI has been one of the most popular tasks at SemEval-2022 with more than 400 participants, 65 teams involved in Sub-task A and 41 in Sub-task B from 13 countries. The MAMI challenge received 4214 submitted runs (of which 166 uploaded on the leader-board), denoting an enthusiastic participation for the proposed problem. The collection and annotation is described for the task dataset. The paper provides an overview of the systems proposed for the challenge, reports the results achieved in both sub-tasks and outlines a description of the main errors for a comprehension of the systems capabilities and for detailing future research perspectives. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Subtask; System capabilities","","","","","","","Agrawal Samyak, Mamidi Radhika, Lastresort at semeval-2022 task 5: Towards misogyny identification using visual linguistic model ensembles and task-specific pretraining, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Andreasen Maja Brandt, rapeable'and 'unrapeable'women: the portrayal of sexual violence in internet memes about# metoo, Journal of Gender Studies, 30, 1, pp. 102-113, (2021); Anzovino Maria, Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 57-64, (2018); Arango Ayme, Perez-Martin Jesus, Labrada Arniel, Hateu at semeval-2022 task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Attanasio Giuseppe, Nozza Debora, Bianchi Federico, MilaNLP at semeval-2022 task 5: Using perceiver IO for detecting misogynous memes with text and image modalities, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Barnwal Shubham Kumar, Kumar Ritesh, Pamula Rajendra, IIT DHANBAD CODECHAMPS at semeval-2022 task 5: MAMI - multimedia automatic misogyny identification, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Basile Valerio, Bosco Cristina, Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Patti Viviana, Manuel Rangel Pardo Francisco, Rosso Paolo, Sanguinetti Manuela, SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63, (2019); Behzadi Mitra, Derakhshan Ali, Harris Ian, Mitra behzadi at semeval-2022 task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification method based on CLIP, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Cer Daniel, Yang Yinfei, Kong Sheng-yi, Hua Nan, Limtiaco Nicole, St John Rhomni, Constant Noah, Guajardo-Cespedes Mario, Yuan Steve, Tar Chris, Et al., Universal sentence encoder, (2018); Chen Lei, Chou Hou Wei, RIT boston at semeval-2022 task 5: Multimedia misogyny detection by using coherent visual and language features from CLIP model and data-centric AI principle, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Chen Tianqi, Guestrin Carlos, Xgboost: A scalable tree boosting system, Proceedings of the 22nd acm sigkdd international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 785-794, (2016); Chen Yen-Chun, Li Linjie, Yu Licheng, El Kholy Ahmed, Ahmed Faisal, Gan Zhe, Cheng Yu, Liu Jingjing, Uniter: Universal image-text representation learning, European conference on computer vision, pp. 104-120, (2020); Cordon Pablo, Diaz Pablo Gonzalez, Mata Jacinto, Pachon Victoria, I2c at semeval-2022 task 5: Identification of misogyny in internet memes, The 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, (2022); Share of u.s. adults who use social media 2019, by gender, (2019); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Eagly Alice H, Mladinic Antonio, Gender stereotypes and attitudes toward women and men, Personality and social psychology bulletin, 15, 4, pp. 543-558, (1989); Rosso Elisabetta Fersini Paolo, Nozza Debora, Ami @ evalita2020: Automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 7th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian (EVALITA 2020), (2020); Emerson Guy, Schluter Natalie, Stanovsky Gabriel, Kumar Ritesh, Palmer Alexis, Schneider Nathan, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Farrell Tracie, Fernandez Miriam, Novotny Jakub, Alani Harith, Exploring misogyny across the manosphere in reddit, Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 87-96, (2019); Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Rosso Paolo, Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (ami), Proceedings of the 6th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian (EVALITA'18), (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Anzovino Maria, Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018, IberEval@ SEPLN, pp. 214-228, (2018); Fleiss Joseph L, Measuring nominal scale agreement among many raters, Psychological bulletin, 76, 5, (1971); Franks Mary Anne, Unwilling avatars: Idealism and discrimination in cyberspace, Colum.

Since pretraining deep models from scratch is a resource and data hungry task, our approach is based on three main strategies. We combine different state-of-the-art architectures to capture a wide spectrum of semantic signals from the multi-modal input. We employ a multitask learning scheme to be able to use multiple datasets from the same knowledge domain to help increase the model's performance. We also use multiple objectives to regularize and fine tune different system components. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Binary classification; Classification framework; Classification tasks; Embeddings; Generic frameworks; Multi-labels; Multi-modal; Pre-training; State of the art; Wide spectrum; Semantics","","","","","","","Ba Jimmy Lei, Kiros Jamie Ryan, Hinton Geoffrey E, Layer normalization, (2016); Carion Nicolas, Massa Francisco, Synnaeve Gabriel, Usunier Nicolas, Kirillov Alexander, Zagoruyko Sergey, End-to-end object detection with transformers, European conference on computer vision, pp. 213-229, (2020); Defazio Aaron, Jelassi Samy, Adaptivity without compromise: a momentumized, adaptive, dual averaged gradient method for stochastic optimization, (2021); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); He Kaiming, Zhang Xiangyu, Ren Shaoqing, Sun Jian, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); Kiela Douwe, Bhooshan Suvrat, Firooz Hamed, Perez Ethan, Testuggine Davide, Supervised multimodal bitransformers for classifying images and text, (2019); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Mathew Binny, Saha Punyajoy, Yimam Seid Muhie, Biemann Chris, Goyal Pawan, Mukherjee Animesh, Hatexplain: A benchmark dataset for explainable hate speech detection, (2020); Radford Alec, Kim Jong Wook, Hallacy Chris, Ramesh Aditya, Goh Gabriel, Agarwal Sandhini, Sastry Girish, Askell Amanda, Mishkin Pamela, Clark Jack, Et al., Learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision, International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 8748-8763, (2021); Ren Shaoqing, He Kaiming, Girshick Ross, Sun Jian, Faster r-cnn: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2015); Tan Mingxing, Le Quoc, Efficientnet: Rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks, International conference on machine learning, pp. 6105-6114, (2019); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2017); Vidgen Bertie, Derczynski Leon, Directions in abusive language training data, a systematic review: Garbage in, garbage out, Plos one, 15, 12, (2020); Wei Xi, Zhang Tianzhu, Li Yan, Zhang Yongdong, Wu Feng, Multi-modality cross attention network for image and sentence matching, Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 10941-10950, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

Due to the amount of content created on these platforms, spotting hate comments individually becomes an impossible task, and automatic hate speech detectors take place on those tasks. Furthermore, identifying hate speech towards women is specially complex due to the cultural background and the subtlety that characterizes it, which makes it interesting to consider it as a phenomenon by itself, differentiating it from traditional hate speech. Our contribution to automatic misogyny identification entails the creation of a machine-learning model based on linguistic and morphological features, applied to the training set of corpus developed at the Automatic Misogyny Evaluation task which contains 3307 tweets written in Spanish. We evaluate our proposal with different machine-learning classifiers achieving the best accuracy of 77% applying Support Vector Machines. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Misogyny detection; Natural Language Processing; Text classification","Linguistics; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Turing machines; Cultural backgrounds; Machine learning models; Morphological features; Positive features; Social media; Training sets; Learning systems","","","","","FEDER/ERDF, (KBS4FIA, PID2019-107652RBI00, TIN2016-76323-R); Spanish National Research Agency; Banco Santander; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","Acknowledgments.

Specifically, we combine linguistic features with contextual transformers based on text (BERT) and images (BEiT). Besides, we also evaluate other ensemble learning strategies and the usage of non-contextual pretrained embeddings. Although our results are limited, we outperform all the baselines proposed, achieving position 36 in the binary classification task with a macro F1-score of 0.687, and position 28 in the multi-label task of misogynous categorisation, with an macro F1-score of 0.663. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Semantics; Binary classification; Classification tasks; Embeddings; Ensemble learning; F1 scores; Features sets; Learning strategy; Linguistic features; Multi-modal; Neural-networks; Embeddings","","","","","European Union NextGenera-tionEU/PRTR; European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Banco Santander; Universidad de Murcia","Funding text 1: This work is part of the research project LaTe4PSP (PID2019-107652RB-I00) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033.

Misogyny detection, even though it plays an important part in hate-speech detection, has not received the same attention. In this paper, we describe our classification systems submitted to the SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification. The shared task aimed to identify misogynous content in a multi-modal setting by analysing meme images together with their textual captions. To this end, we propose two models based on the pre-trained UNITER model, one enhanced with an image sentiment classifier, whereas the second leverages a Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN). Additionally, we explore an ensemble using the aforementioned models. Our best model reaches an F1-score of 71.4% in Sub-task A and 67.3% for Sub-task B positioning our team in the upper third of the leaderboard.

Guided by theoretical frameworks from Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Critical Race Theory (CRT), a convenience sample of 14 science and mathematics teachers participated in a series of virtual chats using open-ended questioning and facilitated by two university instructors. Using conversation and critical discourse analyses, three primary themes emerged: understanding of issues related to stereotypes, encouragement of females and minorities to pursue careers in STEM, and the place for diversity discussions in science and mathematics classrooms. The teachers felt burdened by curricular and administrative constraints that inhibit their ability to participate in thought-provoking critical conversations. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways teachers can assist in the STEM career identity development of their underrepresented females and students of color and calls for research that combines the key findings in SCCT and CRT to build confidence and capacity for teachers to effectively confront issues of racism, sexism, and stereotyping in science and mathematics classrooms. © 2019 School Science and Mathematics Association","classroom discourse;

We enriched the text modality description by incorporating word representations for each object present within the images. Images and text are then described at two levels of detail, globally and locally, using standard dimensionality reduction techniques for images in order to obtain 4 embeddings for each meme. These embeddings are finally concatenated and passed to a classifier. Our results overcome the baseline by 4%, falling behind the best performance by 12% for Sub-task B. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Semantics; Content representation; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Embeddings; Image content; Level-of-detail; Lexical semantics; Performance; Semantic descriptions; Semantic features; Word representations; Embeddings","","","","","Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura A.C.; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Funding text 1: This research has been made possible thanks to generous support from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT).

The phenomenon, also known as Catcalling, recently gained renewed attention in public discussions initiated by social media activists. Combining VR with interactive instruction settings known from museums might be a promising way to effectively reach victims, bystanders, and aggressors alike and obtain a lasting attitude and behavior change. We present a virtual gallery where visitors can explore a variety of curated interactive multimedia material intended to inform, raise awareness, inspire empathy, perspective-taking, and behavioral change. With interactions such as a self-assessment test, as well as opportunities for visitors to leave feedback and thoughts in the gallery, this virtual world can be used as a sensitization tool. Based on a first evaluation with experts (N = 16), the original proof-of-concept prototype was extended and evaluated by a larger group including students (N = 50). © 2021 IEEE","Awareness; Self-assessment; Sensitization; Sexism; Street harassment; Virtual reality","E-learning; Interactive computer systems; Multimedia systems; Attitude change; Awareness; Behaviour changes; Interactive instructions; Interactive multimedia; Self-assessment; Sensitisation; Sexism; Social media; Street harassment; Virtual reality","","","","","Institute of Positive Computing; Marie Fuchs; Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","The authors would like to thank Marie Fuchs, Paula Gerlitz and Mirian Thelen for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript, as well all participants and colleagues providing feedback about the application and contributing to its evaluation.

Monitoring the contents including sexism and sexual harassment in traditional media is easier than monitoring on the online social media platforms like Twitter, because of the large amount of user generated content in these media. So, the research about the automated detection of content containing sexual or racist harassment is an important issue and could be the basis for removing that content or flagging it for human evaluation. Previous studies have been focused on collecting data about sexism and racism in very broad terms. However, there is no much study focusing on different types of online harassment attracting natural language processing techniques. In this work, we present an multi-attention based approach for the detection of different types of harassment in tweets. Our approach is based on the Recurrent Neural Networks and particularly we are using a deep, classification specific multi-attention mechanism. Moreover, we tackle the problem of imbalanced data, using a back-translation method. Finally, we present a comparison between different approaches based on the Recurrent Neural Networks. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Hate speech; Text classification; Twitter","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Attention mechanisms; Automated detection; Back translations; Human evaluation; NAtural language processing; Online social medias; Sexual harassment; User-generated content; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","","","Jha A., Mamidi R., When does a compliment become sexist: Analysis and classification of ambivalent sexism using Twitter data, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, (2017); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people: Predictive features for hate speech detection on Twitter, Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, pp. 88-93, (2016); Sharifirad S., Matwin S., Classification of Different Types of Sexist Languages on Twitter and the Gender Footprint on Each of the Classes, (2018); Sharifirad S., Matwin S., When a tweet is actually sexist, A More Comprehensive Classification of Different Online Harassment Categories and the Challenges in NLP, (2019); Sharifirad S., Matwin S., Jafarpour B., How is Your Mood When Writing Sexist Tweets?

The challenge organizers provide an English meme dataset to develop and train systems for identifying and classifying misogynous memes. More precisely, the competition is separated into two sub-tasks: sub-task A asks for a binary decision as to whether a meme expresses misogyny, while sub-task B is to classify misogynous memes into the potentially overlapping sub-categories of stereotype, shaming, objectification, and violence. For our submission, we implement a new model fusion network and employ an ensemble learning approach for better performance. With this structure, we achieve a 0.755 macro-average F1-score (11th) in sub-task A and a 0.709 weighted-average F1-score (10th) in sub-task B. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Binary decision; Ensemble learning; Ensemble learning approach; Ensemble systems; F1 scores; Modal models; Model fusion; Modeling architecture; Subtask; Train systems; Semantics","","","","","Security for Humans in Cyberspace; Natural Resources Wales, NRW","The work was supported by the PhD School ”SecHuman - Security for Humans in Cyberspace” by the federal state of NRW.","Chetty Naganna, Alathur Sreejith, Hate speech review in the context of online social networks, Aggression and violent behavior, 40, pp. 108-118, (2018); Dosovitskiy Alexey, Beyer Lucas, Kolesnikov Alexander, Weissenborn Dirk, Zhai Xiaohua, Unterthiner Thomas, Dehghani Mostafa, Minderer Matthias, Heigold Georg, Gelly Sylvain, Et al., An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale, (2020); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Gomes Heitor Murilo, Barddal Jean Paul, ­cio Enembreck Fabri, Bifet Albert, A survey on ensemble learning for data stream classification, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 50, 2, pp. 1-36, (2017); Huang Gao, Li Yixuan, Pleiss Geoff, Liu Zhuang, Hopcroft John E., Weinberger Kilian Q., Snapshot ensembles: Train 1, get M for free, 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, (2017); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 2611-2624, (2020); Liu Yinhan, Ott Myle, Goyal Naman, Du Jingfei, Joshi Mandar, Chen Danqi, Levy Omer, Lewis Mike, Zettlemoyer Luke, Stoyanov Veselin, Roberta: A robustly optimized bert pretraining approach, (2019); Loshchilov I., Hutter F., Decoupled weight decay regularization, (2017); Lu Zhibin, Du Pan, Nie Jian-Yun, VGCNBERT: augmenting BERT with graph embedding for text classification, Advances in Information Retrieval, 12035, (2020); Mann H., Whitney D., On a test of whether one of two random variables is stochastically larger than the other, The annals of mathematical statistics, pp. 50-60, (1947); Onan Aytug, Korukoglu Serdar, Bulut Hasan, Ensemble of keyword extraction methods and classifiers in text classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 57, pp. 232-247, (2016); Paszke A., Gross S., Massa F., Lerer A., Bradbury J., Chanan G., Killeen T., Lin Z., Gimelshein N., Antiga L., Et al., Pytorch: An imperative style, high-performance deep learning library, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2019); Sabat Benet Oriol, Ferrer Cristian Canton, Giro-i Nieto Xavier, Hate speech in pixels: Detection of offensive memes towards automatic moderation, (2019); Simonyan Karen, Zisserman Andrew, Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, (2014); Torrey Lisa, Shavlik Jude, Transfer learning, Handbook of research on machine learning applications and trends: algorithms, methods, and techniques, pp. 242-264, (2010); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Velickovic Petar, Cucurull Guillem, Casanova Arantxa, Romero Adriana, Lio Pietro, Bengio Yoshua, Graph attention networks, (2017); Wang Ling, Zhang Chengyun, Bai Renren, Li Jianjun, Duan Hongliang, Heck reaction prediction using a transformer model based on a transfer learning strategy, Chemical Communications, 56, 65, pp. 9368-9371, (2020); Xu Kelvin, Ba Jimmy, Kiros Ryan, Cho Kyunghyun, Courville Aaron, Salakhutdinov Ruslan, Zemel Richard, Bengio Yoshua, Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention, (2016); Yao Liang, Mao Chengsheng, Luo Yuan, Graph convolutional networks for text classification, Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, pp. 7370-7377, (2019); Zhu Ron, Enhance multimodal transformer with external label and in-domain pretrain: Hateful meme challenge winning solution, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

The proposed architecture uses pre-trained models as feature extractors for text and images. We use these features to learn multimodal representation using methods like concatenation and scaled dot product attention. Classification layers are used on fused features as per the subtask definition. We also performed experiments using unimodal models for setting up comparative baselines. Our best performing system achieved an F1 score of 0.757 and was ranked 3rd in Subtask A. On Subtask B, our system performed well with an F1 score of 0.690 and was ranked 10th on the leaderboard.

Hateful content is often used to target a group of people based on ethnicity, gender, religion and other factors. The hate or contempt toward women has been increasing on social platforms. Misogynous content detection is especially challenging when textual and visual modalities are combined to form a single context, e.g., an overlay text embedded on top of an image, also known as meme. In this paper, we present a multimodal architecture that combines textual and visual features to detect misogynous memes. The proposed architecture is evaluated in the SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification challenge under the team name TIB-VA.

Particularly, regarding ageing women. On digital platforms, individuals would have a greater agency to perform and shape gender norms and sexual roles. However, scholarship has been expressing scepticism with the liberatory promise of the online realm, as well as cautions with digital network harassment and the so-called nanosphere. Yet, little is known about how exactly misogynistic rhetoric operates on popular social media to discipline ageing women’s feminity. This paper extends the feminist scholarship to the field of Instagram, focusing specifically on representations of the pop star Madonna. It presents an analysis of how ageing women femininities representations are mobilised on Instagram through a case study of posts indexed with hashtags. Applying computational methods and drawing on the insights of Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis, it approaches these networked representations by exploring the interplay between sexism and ageism within the misogynistic driven forces targeting Madonna and her ageing feminity. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ageism; Online misogyny; Social media","Computer science; Computers; Ageing woman; Critical discourse analysis; Digital networks; Digital platforms; Driven force; Mainstream media; New media; Social media; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (GENDER RESEARCH 4 COVID-19–058)","Acknowledgements.

Natural Language Processing technologies can help in addressing the negative effects of this development. In this contribution we evaluate a set of classification algorithms on two types of user-generated online content (tweets and Wikipedia Talk comments) in two languages (English and German). The different sets of data we work on were classified towards aspects such as racism, sexism, hatespeech, aggression and personal attacks. While acknowledging issues with inter-annotator agreement for classification tasks using these labels, the focus of this paper is on classifying the data according to the annotated characteristics using several text classification algorithms. For some classification tasks we are able to reach f-scores of up to 81.58. © 2018, The Author(s).","","Classification (of information); Digital communication systems; Natural language processing systems; Automatic classification; Classification algorithm; Classification tasks; Digital communications; Natural languages; On-line communication; On-line contents; Text classification; Text processing","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (03WKP45); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Frauen, BMBF","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments.

Since that population change appears in recent 10 years, formerly male-oriented gaming community has confronted gender issues. In this paper, we witness that a strong gender stereotype exists for both genders in Korea by two surveys. In the first survey, subjects show that they have different expectations of opposite gender‟s favorable game style where both genders have exactly same favorite styles. In the second survey, we investigate how members of hostile sexism community groups choose teammates in Overwatch game if they have privilege to select teammates for specific roles. Ilbe and Womad as two far extreme misogyny and misandry groups show hostile sexism in teammate selection. The result implies that hostile sexism and gender stereotype shown in game playing may be induced from other social factors than the amount of the game playing experiences.

It is suggested in this paper that the contested nature of some institutional matters makes this kind of approach problematic, and instead an alternative approach is developed, one that is oriented towards a micro-level analysis of the institutional constraints that we face in everyday life and which can make sense of how there can be institutional facts that are deeply contested and yet still real. The model is applied to two main examples, sexism and racism, and it is argued that on this approach it can make sense to understand both of them as institutions in our societies. © 2018, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Kungl.

[Methodology] The design of the study was observational and cross-sectional, with the participation of 487 eleventh-grade students from public secondary schools in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. Several instruments were applied for measuring hostile and benevolent sexism, perceptions of gender equality in mathematical abilities, mathematical self-efficacy and reasoning abilities. [Results] The results of the multilevel Bayesian random effects analysis confirmed that scores were higher for men than for women in measurements of self-efficacy, where the sex of the student body was a moderator in the relationship of mathematical self-efficacy and test scores. In addition, it was found that, depending on the sex of subjects, the association between self-efficacy and performance was also moderated by the educational center. [Conclusions] Among the conclusions, it is especially noteworthy that if the moderating effect of the educational center between self-efficacy and performance differs by sex, this implies that actions aimed at promoting self-efficacy will not have the same result in men and women, showing the need to develop differentiated interventions. © 2022 The authors.","Bayesian multilevel models; Mathematical self-efficacy; mathematics performance; sexism","","","","","","National Council of Rectors; Consejo Nacional de Rectores, CONARE, (723-B3-307)","Funding for this investigation was provided by the National Council of Rectors (CONARE), Costa Rica: Project “New ways of measuring old ideologies: The case of sexism and its implications in the academic field,” code 723-B3-307.","Plan de estudios de Bachillerato y Licenciatura en Enseñanza de la Matemática, (2017); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological review, 84, 2, pp. 191-215, (1977); Berkowitz R., School climate and the socioeconomic literacy achievement gap: Multilevel analysis of compensation, mediation, and moderation models, Children and Youth Services Review, 130, pp. 1-10, (2021); Berkowitz R., Glickman H., Benbenishty R., Ben-Artzi E., Raz T., Lipshtat N., Astor R.

The impact of comments has been investigated in several studies. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are just a few of the social media networks that are used to broadcast different news worldwide. In this paper, a comprehensive AI-based study is presented to automatically detect the Arabic text misogyny and sarcasm in binary and multiclass scenarios. The key of the proposed AI approach is to distinguish various topics of misogyny and sarcasm from Arabic tweets in social media networks. A comprehensive study is achieved for detecting both misogyny and sarcasm via adopting seven state-of-the-art NLP classifiers: ARABERT, PAC, LRC, RFC, LSVC, DTC, and KNNC. To fine tune, validate, and evaluate all of these techniques, two Arabic tweets datasets (i.e., misogyny and Abu Farah datasets) are used. For the experimental study, two scenarios are proposed for each case study (misogyny or sarcasm): binary and multiclass problems. For misogyny detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT classifier with 91.0% for binary classification scenario and 89.0% for the multiclass scenario. For sarcasm detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT as well with 88% for binary classification scenario and 77.0% for the multiclass scenario. The proposed method appears to be effective in detecting misogyny and sarcasm in social media platforms with suggesting AraBERT as a superior state-of-the-art deep learning classifier.  © 2022 Abdullah Y.

A manual checking procedure together with a word-based heuristic was used to identify whether an article related to women or men. The heuristic includes explicit mentions of women and men, implicit mentions, and a set of gender-focused health issues and medical terminology. Based on the results, more published articles now relate to women than to men. Moreover, more than twice as many articles relate exclusively to women than exclusively to men, with the ratio increasing from 2.16 to 1 in 1996 to 2.25 to 1 in 2020. Monogender articles mostly addressed primarily female health issues (maternity, breast cancer, cervical cancer) with fewer about primarily male health issues (testicular cancer, pancreatic cancer, health needs of men who have sex with men). Some articles also explicitly addressed gender inequality, such as empowering female entrepreneurs. The findings suggest that the androcentrism of early science has eroded in terms of research topics. This apparent progress should be encouraging for women researchers and society. © 2022 Mike Thelwall, Abrizah Abdullah, and Ruth Fairclough.","academic research; androcentrism; feminism; gender equity; research publishing; sexism","","","","","","","","Auchmuty R., Rackley E., Feminist legal biography: A model for all legal life stories, Journal of Legal History, 41, 2, pp. 186-211, (2020); Baggio G., Corsini A., Floreani A., Giannini S., Zagonel V., Gender medicine: A task for the third millennium, Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, 51, 4, pp. 713-727, (2013); Ball J.

The task deals with Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI). Hateful memes need to be detected within a data collection. For this task, we implemented six models for text and image analysis and tested the effectiveness of their combinations. A fusion system implements a multi-modal transformer to integrate the embeddings of these models. The best performing models included BERT for the text of the meme, manually derived associations for words in the memes and a Faster R-CNN network for the image. We evaluated the performance of our approach also with the data of the Facebook Hateful Memes challenge in order to analyze the generalisation capabilities of the approach. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","CNN network; Data collection; Deep text; Embeddings; Fusion systems; Image modeling; Image-analysis; Multi-modal; Text analysis; Text modeling; Semantics","","","","","","","Ba Lei Jimmy, Kiros Jamie Ryan, Hinton Geoffrey E., Layer normalization, CoRR, (2016); Basile Valerio, Bosco Cristina, Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Patti Viviana, Manuel Rangel Pardo Francisco, Rosso Paolo, Sanguinetti Manuela, SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter, Proc.13th Intl.

The main aim was to investigate whether the young people, as current and future designers and developers of technologies for older people, have ageist and sexist attitudes about older people as users of technology. A second aim was to investigate whether their attitudes differ from those of older people. Participants were shown a picture of either a young or old Chinese woman or man and asked to assess the likelihood that this person would use a desktop computer, laptop computer and a smartphone, and their level of expertise in each of these technologies. Both young and older Chinese people showed negative attitudes towards older adults compared to young ones as both users of and experts in technology, and negative attitudes towards women compared to men. However, there was only slight evidence of “double discrimination” towards older women, this was on use of the technologies rather than expertise with the technologies. These results show that young Chinese workers in technology need education in the characteristics and needs of their older potential audiences. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ageism; Perceptions of older Chinese people; Perceptions of older Chinese women; Perceptions of technology expertise; Perceptions of technology use; Sexism","Behavioral research; Engineering education; Ageism; Chinese people; Older People; Perception of old chinese people; Perception of old chinese woman; Perception of technology expertise; Perception of technology use; Sexism; Technology use; Workers'; Laptop computers","","","","","","","Ayalon L., Perceived age, gender, and racial/ethnic discrimination in Europe: Results from the European social survey, Educ.

Furthermore, a large amount of users generating publications on online media like Twitter contributes to the hardness of controlling sexism and sexual harassment content, requesting robust methods of Machine Learning (ML) to be applied in this task. To do so, this work aims at comparing the performance of supervised ML algorithms to categorize online harassment in Twitter posts. We tested Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear SVM, Gaussian SVM, Polynomial SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and AdaBoost methods on the SIMAH Competition benchmark data, using TF-IDF vectors and Word2Vec embeddings as features. As results, we reached scores above 0.80% of accuracy for all the harassment types in the data. We also showed that, when using TF-IDF vectors, Linear and Gaussian SVM are the best methods to predict harassment content, while Decision Trees and Random Forest better categorize physical and sexual harassment. Overall, by using TF-IDF vectors presented higher performance on these data, suggesting that the training corpus for Word2Vec influenced negatively on the classification task outcomes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Online harassment; Text classification; Twitter","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Forestry; Gaussian distribution; Logistic regression; Polynomial regression; Random forests; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Benchmark data; Classification tasks; Ml algorithms; Multi layer perceptron; Robust methods; Sexual harassment; Training corpus; Virtual spaces; Learning systems","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2018/09465-0); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Dalhousie University","Supported by the organization of ECML PKDD 2019.","Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, (2017); Boser B.E., Guyon I.M., Vapnik V.N., pp. 144-152; Breiman L., Random forests, Mach.

Every big news before telecasting on television comes to these forums, therefore raises many dilemmas due to misinterpretation regarding the freedom of speaking. One of this trouble is social intimidation that is very disturbing misbehavior that can cause troubling consequences for the victim. Existing works of social intimidation focuses on only one or two topics of harassment. The main aim of this study is to analyze the hub of social intimidation i.e. twitter, consisting of 25,000 tweets covering five topics of harassment i.e. sexism, racism, appearance related, political and intellectual. Moreover, five machine learning and four deep learning techniques were used namely sequential minimal optimization (SMO), random forest, multinomial naïve bayes, logistic regression (LR), decision tree J48, CNN-CB, CNN-GRU, CNN-LRCN and CNN-Bi-LSTM. Each of the classifiers are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure as a performance metric on the dataset. Results indicate the dominance of CNN-Bi-LSTM and logistic regression among all classifiers used. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CNN-Bi-LSTM; CNN-CB; CNN-GRU; CNN-LRCN; J48; Logistic regression; Multinomial NB; SMO; Social intimidation","Classification (of information); Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Optimization; Random forests; CNN-bi-LSTM; CNN-CB; CNN-GRU; CNN-LRCN; J48; Logistics regressions; Multinomial NB; Multinomials; Sequential minimal optimization; Social intimidation; Decision trees","","","","","","","Patchin J.W., Hinduja S., It is time to teach safe sexting, J.

Keeping in mind research that has indicated that adolescents imbibe social behavior from movies, we propose a hybrid deep learning model to detect the degree of prejudice (sexism, racism, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia etc) in movies. Using a stacked bi-LSTM and XGBoost model to make predictions, we compared the percentage of prejudice in movies from two time periods (1975-2000 and 2001-2020). Further, we compared animated movies from production houses like Disney, Pixar with movies often rated R or PG-18 by Motion Picture Content Rating Boards. The results showed that the percentage of prejudice has been significantly reduced in the newer decades, and that, surprisingly, movies intended for a younger target audience, on average, perpetuate more prejudice than those meant for late teenagers and adults.  © 2022 IEEE.","Gradient Boosting; Long Short Term Memory; Sentiment Analysis; Text Analysis","Motion pictures; Sentiment analysis; Content ratings; Gradient boosting; Learning models; Production house; Sentiment analysis; Social behaviour; Target audience; Text analysis; Time-periods; Long short-term memory","","","","","","","Ciranka S., Van Den Bos W., Social influence in adolescent decision-making: A formal framework, Frontiers in Psychology, 10, (2019); Valkenburg P., Piotrowski J., Pluggedin: How media attract and affect youth, (2017); Kubrak T., Impact of films: Changes in young people's attitudes after watching a movie, Behav Sci (Basel), 10, 5, (2020); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-term memory, Neural computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); American Psychological Association Dictionary of Psychology; Singh S., Anand T., Ghosh Chowdhury A., Waseem Z., hold on honey, men at work: A semi-supervised approach to detecting sex-ism in sitcoms, Proceedings of the 59th AnnualMeeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: Student Research Workshop, pp. 180-185, (2021); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people?

Indeed, the Petrie model predicts that such sexism will emerge whenever there is a male majority, and quantifies this majority bias by the 'Petrie multiplier': the square of the male/female ratio. In this paper - emulating the shift from 'normal' to 'anomalous' diffusion - we generalize the Petrie model to a stochastic Poisson model that accommodates heterogeneously sexist men and woman, and that extends the 'normal' quadratic Petrie multiplier to 'anomalous' non-quadratic multipliers. The Petrie multipliers span a full spectrum of behaviors which we classify into four universal types. A variation of the stochastic Poisson model and its Petrie multipliers is further applied to the context of cyber warfare. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","anomalous diffusion; anomalous Petrie multipliers; normal diffusion; normal Petrie multipliers; Petrie model; sexism","","","","","","","","Ranson G., Reeves W.J., Gender Soc., 10, (1996); McKay S.C., Gender Soc., 20, (2006); Wasburn M.H., Miller S.G., J.

Given the rising number of experiences of sexism reported online, categorizing these recollections automatically can aid the fight against sexism, as it can facilitate effective analyses by gender studies researchers and government officials involved in policy making. In this paper, we explore the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism wherein the approach goes beyond merely fine-tuning pre-trained models using unlabeled data. We devise self-training based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. Several proposed methods outperform a variety of baselines on a recently released dataset for multi-label sexism categorization across several standard metrics. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fine-grained categorization; Multi-label classification; Semi-supervised learning; Sexism classification","Classification (of information); Information systems; Information use; Systems engineering; Class imbalance; Effective analysis; Government officials; Multi label classification; Problem formulation; Semi-supervised; Standard metrics; Unlabeled samples; Semi-supervised learning","","","","","","","Abney S., Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics, (2007); Agrawal S., Awekar A., Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms, ECIR 2018.

Besides offensive messages, memes are one of the main means of dissemination for such content. With these premises, the MAMI task was proposed at the SemEval-2022, which consists of identifying memes with misogynous characteristics. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem based on Mask R-CNN and VisualBERT that leverages the multimodal nature of the task. Our study focuses on observing how the two sources of data in memes (text and image) and their possible combinations impact performances. Our best result slightly exceeds the higher baseline, but the experiments allowed us to draw important considerations regarding the importance of correctly exploiting the visual information and the relevance of the elements present in the memes images. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Gender discrimination; Impact performance; Multi-modal; Offensive messages; Problem-based; Social media; Two sources; Visual elements; Visual information; Semantics","","","","","","","Barnum George, Talukder Sabera, Yue Yisong, On the benefits of early fusion in multimodal representation learning, (2020); Deshpande Tanvi, Mani Nitya, An interpretable approach to hateful meme detection, (2021); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Saibene Giulia Rizzi Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); Gupta Agrim, Dollar Piotr, Girshick Ross, Lvis: A dataset for large vocabulary instance segmentation, (2019); He Kaiming, Gkioxari Georgia, Dollar Piotr, Girshick Ross, Mask r-cnn, (2018); Kiela Douwe, Firooz Hamed, Mohan Aravind, Goswami Vedanuj, Singh Amanpreet, Ringshia Pratik, Testuggine Davide, The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes, (2021); LeCun Y., Haffner P., Bottou L., Bengio Y., Object recognition with gradient-based learning, Feature Grouping, (1999); Ka-Wei Lee Roy, Cao Rui, Fan Ziqing, Jiang Jing, Chong Wen-Haw, Disentangling hate in online memes, Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, (2021); Li Liunian Harold, Yatskar Mark, Yin Da, Hsieh Cho-Jui, Chang Kai-Wei, Visualbert: A simple and performant baseline for vision and language, (2019); Lin Tsung-Yi, Maire Michael, Belongie Serge, Bourdev Lubomir, Girshick Ross, Hays James, Perona Pietro, Ramanan Deva, Lawrence Zitnick C., Dollar Piotr, Microsoft coco: Common objects in context, (2015); Loshchilov Ilya, Hutter Frank, Decoupled weight decay regularization, 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019, (2019); Lu Jiasen, Batra Dhruv, Parikh Devi, Lee Stefan, Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks, (2019); Mozafari Marzieh, Farahbakhsh Reza, «l Crespi Noi, A bert-based transfer learning approach for hate speech detection in online social media, Complex Networks and Their Applications VIII, pp. 928-940, (2020); Muennighoff Niklas, Vilio: State-of-the-art visiolinguistic models applied to hateful memes, (2020); Peinelt Nicole, Nguyen Dong, Liakata Maria, Better early than late: Fusing topics with word embeddings for neural question paraphrase identification, (2020); Pramanick Shraman, Sharma Shivam, Dimitrov Dimitar, Akhtar Md Shad, Nakov Preslav, Chakraborty Tanmoy, Momenta: A multimodal framework for detecting harmful memes and their targets, (2021); Simonyan Karen, Zisserman Andrew, Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, (2015); Vaswani Ashish, Shazeer Noam, Parmar Niki, Uszkoreit Jakob, Jones Llion, Gomez Aidan N, Kaiser Lukasz, Polosukhin Illia, Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Velioglu Riza, Rose Jewgeni, Detecting hate speech in memes using multimodal deep learning approaches: Prize-winning solution to hateful memes challenge, (2020); Zhu Ron, Enhance multimodal transformer with external label and in-domain pretrain: Hateful meme challenge winning solution, (2020)","","Emerson G.; Schluter N.; Stanovsky G.; Kumar R.; Palmer A.; Schneider N.; Singh S.; Ratan S.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)","16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2022","14 July 2022 through 15 July 2022","Seattle","181952","","978-195591780-3","","","English","SemEval - Int.

In the SemEval-2022 Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI) challenge, we designed a system using two simple but effective principles. First, we leverage on recently emerging Transformer models pre-trained (mostly in a self-supervised learning way) on massive data sets to obtain very effective visual (V) and language (L) features. In particular, we used the CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) model provided by OpenAI to obtain coherent V and L features and then simply used a logistic regression model to make binary predictions. Second, we emphasized more on data rather than tweaking models by following the data-centric AI principle. These principles were proven to be useful and our final macro-F1 is 0.778 for the MAMI task A and ranked the third place among participant teams. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Semantics; Data centric; Language features; Logistic Regression modeling; Massive data sets; Simple++; Third places; Transformer modeling; Visual feature; Visual languages","","","","","","","Cer Daniel, Yang Yinfei, Kong Sheng-yi, Hua Nan, Limtiaco Nicole, St John Rhomni, Constant Noah, Guajardo-Cespedes Mario, Yuan Steve, Tar Chris, Et al., Universal sentence encoder, (2018); Chou H., Lee Y.H., Chen L., Xia Y., Chen W.T., CBB-FE, CamemBERT and BiT Feature Extraction for Multimodal Product Classification and Retrieval, Proc.

With the increase in the use of social media, this feeling of hatred towards women and immigrants can be more easily expressed, therefore it can cause harmful effects on social media users. For this reason, it is important to develop systems capable of detecting hateful comments automatically. In this paper, we describe our system to analyze the hate speech in English and Spanish tweets against Immigrants and Women as part of our participation in SemEval-2019 Task 5: hatEval. Our main contribution is the integration of three individual algorithms of prediction in a model based on Vote ensemble classifier. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Computational linguistics; Semantics; Speech recognition; Ensemble learning; Ensemble-classifier; Harmful effects; Model-based OPC; Social media; Social problems; Social networking (online)","","","","","Spanish Government; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R)","This work has been partially supported by Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) and REDES project (TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R) from the Spanish Government.","Basile Valerio, Bosco Cristina, Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Patti Viviana, Rangel Francisco, Rosso Paolo, Sanguinetti Manuela, Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), (2019); Canos Jose Sebastian, Misogyny identification through svm at ibereval 2018, (2018); Erjavec Karmen, Kovacic Melita Poler, you don't understand, this is a new war!” analysis of hate speech in news web sites' comments, Mass Communication and Society, 15, 6, pp. 899-920, (2012); Fersini Elisabetta, Nozza Debora, Rosso Paolo, Overview of the evalita 2018 task on automatic misogyny identification (ami), Proceedings of the 6th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian (EVALITA18), (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Anzovino Maria, Overview of the task on automatic misogyny identification at ibereval 2018, (2018); Fortuna Paula, Nunes Sergio, A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51, 4, (2018); Manne Kate, Down girl: The logic of misogyny, (2017); Moraes Rodrigo, Valiati JoaO Francisco, Neto O, Document-level sentiment classification: An empirical comparison between svm and ann, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 2, pp. 621-633, (2013); Pedregosa Fabian, Varoquaux Gael, Gram-fort Alexandre, Michel Vincent, Thirion Bertrand, Grisel Olivier, Blondel Mathieu, Prettenhofer Peter, Weiss Ron, Dubourg Vincent, Et al., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in python, Journal of machine learning research, 12, Oct, pp. 2825-2830, (2011); Sanguinetti Manuela, Poletto Fabio, Bosco Cristina, Patti Viviana, Marco Stranisci, An italian twitter corpus of hate speech against immigrants, Language Resources and Evaluation ConferenceLREC 2018, pp. 1-8, (2018); Tsytsarau Mikalai, Palpanas Themis, Survey on mining subjective data on the web, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 24, 3, pp. 478-514, (2012); Waseem Zeerak, Hovy Dirk, Hateful symbols or hateful people? predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter, Proceedings of the NAACL student research workshop, pp. 88-93, (2016)","","","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX); Microsoft","13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2019, co-located with the 17th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL HLT 2019","6 June 2019 through 7 June 2019","Minneapolis","172737","","978-195073706-2","","","English","NAACL HLT - Int.

Even those who doubt that the proposal represents a sincere recognition of the women’s equality with men must provide a plausible explanation for this radical departure from the norms of Plato’s day. Taking inspiration from Annie Larivée’s application of Michèle Le Doeuff’s notion of déshérence to the Republic and the Politicus, I argue that a new appreciation of the importance of childrearing motivates the reimagination of women’s work in the Republic. On this reading, the transformation of childrearing from a private undertaking of mostly women to a shared responsibility of the city as a whole protects young children from moral corruption at the hands of uneducated and morally inferior mothers and nurses. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Childrearing; Education; Misogyny; Mothers; Plato; Politics; Republic; Women rulers","","","","","","","","Republic (G.

The different deep learning methods compared in this paper are: (i) unimodal image or text models (ii) fusion of unimodal models (iii) multimodal transformers models and (iv) transformers further pretrained on a multimodal task. From our experiments, we found pretrained multimodal transformer architectures to strongly outperform the models involving fusion of representation from both the modalities. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Learning systems; Semantics; Comparatives studies; Image modeling; Image-based; Learning methods; Learning models; Multi-modal; Text modeling; Transformer modeling; Unimodal; Unimodal image; Deep learning","","","","","","","Abburi Harika, Parikh Pulkit, Chhaya Niyati, Varma Vasudeva, Semi-supervised multi-task learning for multi-label fine-grained sexism classification, Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pp. 5810-5820, (2020); Anzovino Mary E., Fersini Elisabetta, Rosso Paolo, Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on twitter, NLDB, (2018); Barreto Manuela, Ellemers Naomi, The perils of political correctness: Men's and women's responses to old-fashioned and modern sexist views, Social Psychology Quarterly, 68, 1, pp. 75-88, (2005); ®t Dardenne Benoi, Dumont Muriel, Bollier Thierry., Insidious dangers of benevolent sexism: consequences for women's performance, Journal of personality and social psychology, 93, 5, pp. 764-779, (2007); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Fersini Elisabetta, Gasparini Francesca, Rizzi Giulia, Saibene Aurora, Chulvi Berta, Rosso Paolo, Lees Alyssa, Sorensen Jeffrey, SemEval-2022 Task 5: Multimedia automatic misogyny identification, Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), (2022); He Kaiming, Zhang Xiangyu, Ren Shaoqing, Sun Jian, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); Jha Akshita, Mamidi Radhika, When does a compliment become sexist?

We first collect all the profile images of the candidates’ Twitter followers. Then we train a convolutional neural network using images that contain gender labels. Lastly, we classify all the follower and unfollower images. Through a case study of the ‘woman card’ controversy, we demonstrate how gender is informing the 2016 presidential election.

Sociologists have attributed the leaky progression of women through professional hierarchies to various cultural and psychological factors, such as self-segregation and bias. Here, we present a minimal mathematical model that reveals the relative role that bias and homophily (self-seeking) may play in the ascension of women through professional hierarchies. Unlike previous models, our novel model predicts that gender parity is not inevitable, and deliberate intervention may be required to achieve gender balance in several fields. To validate the model, we analyze a new database of gender fractionation over time for 16 professional hierarchies. We quantify the degree of homophily and bias in each professional hierarchy, and we propose specific interventions to achieve gender parity more quickly. © 2019 Author(s).","","Female; Humans; Leadership; Models, Theoretical; Sexism; female; human; leadership; sexism; theoretical model","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1324585, 1449269, DGE-1324585, DMS-1449269, DMS-1547394)","Funding text 1: This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship No. DGE-1324585 and Mathways Grant No. DMS-1449269 (S.M.C.), Royal E.; Funding text 2: Cabell Terminal Year Fellowship (K.H. and E.A.A.), and the National Science Foundation Research Training Grant No. DMS-1547394 (A.J.K.).

However, with this much contribution, it also increases systematic inequality and discrimination offline is replicated in online spaces in the form of MEMEs. A meme is essentially an image characterized by pictorial content with an overlaying text a posteriori introduced by humans, with the main goal of being funny and/or ironic. Although most of them are created with the intent of making funny jokes, in a short time people started to use them as a form of hate and prejudice against women, landing to sexist and aggressive messages in online environments that subsequently amplify the sexual stereotyping and gender inequality of the offline world. This leads to the need for automatic detection of Misogyny MEMEs.
