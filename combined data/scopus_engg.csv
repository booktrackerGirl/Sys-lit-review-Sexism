While body parameters may differently affect the magnitude of impact force in men and women, the effect of sex is not considered in existing impact force predictors. The objective of this study was to construct a female-specific equation to predict the fall-induced impact force applied to the hip and evaluate whether it could improve hip facture risk assessment. A previously developed human-body dynamic model was used to simulate falling of 80 women and determine the hip impact force. Results were then used to derive a female-specific equation between impact force and body parameters. The proposed female-specific equation and available non-sex-specific impact force predictors in the literature were integrated with a finite element model to discriminate hip fracture patients among 393 women (99 hip fractures; 294 non-fracture controls). Results of the implemented methods were compared to evaluate whether considering the effect of sex could improve the discrimination of females with and without a hip fracture. The area under the curve (AUC)and odds ratio (OR)for the assessed hip fracture risk by the proposed female-specific method (AUC = 0.799, OR = 4.22)were significantly (p<0.001)greater than those of non-sex-specific methods (the most accurate: AUC =0.750, OR =3.62). This study indicates that the proposed equation may be useful to improve hip fracture risk assessment for women. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Body parameters; Fall; Hip fracture; Hip impact force; Hip soft tissue; Sex-specific; Sideways","Accidental Falls; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Femur; Hip Fractures; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Pelvic Bones; Risk Assessment; Sex Characteristics; Fracture; Body parameters; Fall; Hip fracture; Impact force; Sex-specific; Sideways; Soft tissue; adult; area under the curve; Article; biomechanics; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; falling; female; hip fracture; human; major clinical study; middle aged; muscle strength; population research; prediction; priority journal; risk assessment; sex ratio; sexism; biological model; femur; male; pathophysiology; pelvic girdle; physiology; sexual characteristics; Risk assessment","","","","","St. Boniface General Hospital; University of Manitoba Medical School; Research Manitoba; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: The reported research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council (NSERC) and Research Manitoba in Canada, which are gratefully acknowledged.

Participants helping to organize and take part included students, faculty, administrators, postdoctoral researchers and others connected to the world of engineering education. The intention of this week of action (directly following E-Week) was three fold. First, we aimed to test approaches from social movements and assess their promise for change in engineering education. Second, we sought to deepen conversations around power, privilege, and a critical perspective on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). This entailed challenging current conversations taking place around DEI, and taking time to think about our roles as ally, advocate, or accomplice with groups and people who may not have been at the table previously. Our third intention was to invite the community to take action; to move engineers toward disrupting the status quo that maintains systems of power and privilege and rethinking how engineering education is shaped by and in turn shapes dominant logics of oppression such as white supremacy, colonialism, racism, and sexism. This paper reviews the social movement organizing theories employed and the networks engaged both inside and outside of engineering in order to achieve these goals. We then provide details regarding our organizing practices and the specific activities that participants engaged in during the week of action. Finally, we will share reflections on lessons learned about the process and its outcomes, with the expectation that conversation and feedback received from the broader engineering education community will inform recurring efforts in this domain, and grow participation in a social movement approach to change in engineering education. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","","Critical perspectives; Engineering educators; Postdoctoral researchers; Social movements; Specific activity; Status quo; Three folds; Engineering education","","","","","","","Quiles-Ramos S., Foster E.

To understand whether this also cuts across racial lines, and furthermore, whether it differs from objectifying treatment of actual people, we conducted a preliminary mixed-methods investigation of online commentary on videos of three such robots - Bina48, Nadine, and YangYang - contrasted with commentary on videos of three women with similar identity cues. Analysis of the frequency and nature of abusive commentary suggests that: (1) the verbal abuse of the Bina48 and YangYang (two robots racialized as Black and Asian respectively) is laced with both subtle and overt racism; (2) people more readily engage in the verbal abuse of humanlike robots (versus other people). Not only do these findings reflect a concerning phenomenon, consideration is warranted as to whether peoples engagement in abusive interactions with humanlike robots could impact their subsequent interactions with other people. © 2018 Authors.","androids; human-robot interaction; humanlike robots; objectification; racism; robot abuse; sexism","Man machine systems; androids; Humanlike robots; objectification; racism; sexism; Human robot interaction","","","","","","","Brsci D., Kidokoro H., Suehiro Y., Kanda T., Escaping from children's abuse of social robots, Proceedings of HRI.

According to the research, the objective was to analyze the predictive relationship of the Disney Princess films in the way of thinking regarding the ideal female and male prototype, male chauvinist, sexism, and ideas of happiness. The participants were 131 people from Lima-Perú, of them 49 men (37.4%) and 82 women (62.6%) between 16 and 59 years old (Mage = 22,85, SD = 9.05). Through exploratory and predictive correlational analyzes, it was possible to identify that stereotypes of princesses have a greater influence on people with a lower educational level. In addition, it was possible to identify that stereotypes of princesses significantly influence women and men. Finally, the princesses’ influence on women predicts the idea of an ideal male and female, macho and sexist practice, and the ideal of happiness. On the other hand, the princesses influence on males predicts only the idea of an ideal male and female; thus, demonstrating that Disney princess movies predict more ways of thinking about women. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Film media; Gender stereotypes; Male chauvinist; Sexism","Software engineering; Educational levels; Gender stereotypes; Predictive relationships; Ways of thinking; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Ellemers N., Gender stereotypes, Ann.

They intend to bring a frame of reflexivity toward awareness of the politics imbued in technology as well as the often exclusionary cultures entangled therein. Further this research brings field work observations of these groups and their practices (designated as Study 1) into conversation with interviews of engineering education researchers (designated as Study 2). In that vein, this examination asks: What might an analysis of the practices and mindsets of feminist hacker and opensource science hardware groups contribute to the world of engineering education, specifically for educators interested in change-making strategies for creating a more equitable higher education environment that takes on issues of racism, sexism, heteronormativity, ableism, etc.? With a theoretical grounding in the work of Myles Horton and the Highlander Research and Education Center's theory of change, bell hooks' liberatory pedagogies, and social movement theory from a science and technology studies (STS) perspective, this paper aims to examine how current social movements in technology, specifically the organizing work of feminist hacker and tech collectives as well as those working with opensource science hardware, might inform changes to engineering practice via educational reform. Data collection for this work involves participant observation from four different meetings and discursive analysis of websites and promotional materials. The result is a multi-modal analysis which will then be brought into conversation with previous work on 32 interviews with engineering education practitioners who have identified issues in the discipline and are interested in enacting change in the higher institutional setting. Such work has implications for engineering education reform and organizing possibilities toward enabling educators to seed the changes they seek. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","","Electric grounding; Engineering research; Modal analysis; Personal computing; Educational reforms; Engineering education reforms; Engineering educators; Engineering practices; Institutional setting; Participant observations; Promotional materials; Science and technology studies; Engineering education","","","","","","","Brown P., Popular epidemiology and toxic waste contamination: Lay and professional ways of knowing, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 33, pp. 267-281, (1992); Epstein S., Impure Science: AIDS, Activism, and the Politics of Knowledge, (1996); Moore K., Disrupting Science Social Movements, American Scientists, and the Politics of the Military, 1945-1975, (2008); Wisnioski M., Engineers for Change: Competing Visions of Technology in 1960s America, (2012); Toupin S., Feminist hackerspaces: The synthesis of feminist and hacker cultures, Journal of Peer Production, 4, (2012); Forlano L., Hacking the feminist disabled body, Journal of Peer Production, 8, (2016); Fox S., Ulgado R.R., Rosner D., Hacking culture, not devices: Access and recognition in feminist hackerspaces, Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, (2015); Foster E., Claims of equity and expertise: Feminist interventions in the design of DIY communities and cultures, Design Issues, (2019); Foster E., Karlin J., Quiles-Ramos S., Riley D., Seeding and sustaining a movement: Establishing campaign strategies/tactics toward addressing root causes of inequity in engineering education, Proc. 2019 CoNECD - The Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity Conference, (2019); Dey E.L., Milem J.F., Berger J.B., Changing patterns of publication productivity:Accumulative advantage or institutional isomorphism?, Sociology of Education, 70, 4, pp. 308-323, (1997); Fairweather J.S., Faculty reward structures: Toward institutional and professional homogenization, Research in Higher Education, 34, 5, pp. 603-623, (1993); Horton M., The Long Haul: An Autobiography, (1998); Merrifield J., Putting scientists in their place: Participatory research in environmental and occupational health, Issue 12 of Working Paper Series, (1989); Newsletter, (2013); Oliveros P., Deep Listening: A Composer's Sound Practice, (2005); Imarisha W., Brown A.M., Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements, (2015); Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, (1994); Murphy M., Unsettling care: Troubling transnational itineraries of care in feminist health practices, Social Studies of Science, 45, 5, pp. 717-737, (2015); Martin A., Myers N., Viseu A., The politics of care in technoscience, Social Studies of Science, 45, 5, pp. 625-641, (2015); Alinsky S., Rules for Radicals: A Practical Primer for Realistic Radicals, (1989); Berg B.L., Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, (2001); Corbin J., Strauss A., Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (2008); Strauss A., Corbin C., Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques, (1990); Riley D.M., Karlin J., Pratt J.L., Matos S.M., Board # 127: Building social infrastructure for achieving change at scale, 2017 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, (2017); Chambers E.T., Roots for Radicals: Organizing for Power, Action, and Justice, (2003); Gecan M., Going Public: An Organizer's Guide to Citizen Action, (2004); Quiles-Ramos S., Foster E., Karlin J., Riley D.M., Infrastructure Sinkholes: The Pretense of Operating Gender-Neutral Organizations Erodes Engineering Education; Marcus G.E., Fischer M.M., A crisis of representation in the human sciences, Anthropology as Cultural Critique: An Experimental Moment in the Human Sciences, pp. 7-16, (1986); Marcus G.E., Multi-sited ethnography: Five or six things I know about it now, Multi-Sited Ethnography, pp. 24-40, (2012)","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","126th ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition: Charged Up for the Next 125 Years, ASEE 2019","15 June 2019 through 19 June 2019","Tampa","157034","21535965","","","","English","ASEE Annu.

It proposes a theoretical model, of a bottom-up nature, to achieve gender equality in the school environment, giving special importance to teacher training. This study evaluates the training in gender equality and coeducation that students with degrees related to teaching are receiving. An analysis is conducted of the presence of attitudes that support the gender/sex system and the identification of relevant female references in a sample of 452 students in the Degree in Primary Education or the University Master’s Degree in Teacher Training for Compulsory Secondary Education, Upper Secondary Education, Vocational Training, and Language Teaching (MUPES). For the collection of information, an ad hoc questionnaire was used that contemplates formative and cultural aspects, together with the Inventory of Ambivalent Sexism (ASI), the Attitudes of Heterosexuals toward Homosexuals (HATH), and the Women in History (WH) scales. Among the main results, the important lack of training in aspects related to gender equality and coeducation, as well as a general lack of knowledge of historical female references, stands out. It can be concluded that, at present, teacher training is still in the early stages of the proposed model. © 2021 by the authors.

However, few of these studies have reported on the transition from capstone training to engineering practice. Capstone is meant to prepare engineering students for the workplace by simulating engineering work, but this is not the same as preparing women for the (presumably) gendered experiences of engineering work. This study aims to answer the question: What unique challenges do women face in their first year of engineering work? We ask this question to make way for the question: What should women be prepared for in transitioning to engineering work? Participants for this study are drawn from a larger study of four universities across the United States. The total participant group used for this study included 45 engineering newcomers, 22 identified as female, and 23 identified as male on a screening questionnaire that included transgender, gender-nonconforming, and an option to skip the question. The data set included interviews with the participants conducted at three, six, and twelve months of work. Interviews were analyzed with multiple rounds of coding to determine which challenges articulated by participants were unique to women. Results indicate that women face many of the same challenges as men. Women also face a set of unique challenges, which were sometimes overtly rooted in sexism. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","","Data set; Engineering practices; Engineering works; First year; Women in engineering; Professional aspects","","","","","","","Tonso K.

The exposure to sexist speech has serious consequences to women's life and limits their freedom of speech. Previous studies have focused on identifying hatred or violence towards women. However, sexism is expressed in very different forms: it includes subtle stereotypes and attitudes that, although frequently unnoticed, are extremely harmful for both women and society. In this work, we propose a new task that aims to understand and analyze how sexism, from explicit hate or violence to subtle expressions, is expressed in online conversations. To this end, we have developed and released the first dataset of sexist expressions and attitudes in Twitter in Spanish (MeTwo) and investigate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques (both traditional and novel deep learning models) for automatically detecting different types of sexist behaviours. Our results show that sexism is frequently found in many forms in social networks, that it includes a wide range of behaviours, and that it is possible to detect them using deep learning approaches. We discuss the performance of automatic classification methods to deal with different types of sexism and the generalizability of our task to other subdomains, such as misogyny. © 2013 IEEE.","machine learning; natural language processing; Sexism detection; social media","","","","","","","","Wright M.F., Harper B.D., Wachs S., The associations between cyberbullying and callous-unemotional traits among adolescents: The moderating effect of online disinhibition, J.

The authors draw on more than a decade of research to document and analyze the reasons for the transformation. As their sense of identity changes, many female farmers are challenging the sexism they face in their chosen profession. In this book, farm women in the northeastern United States describe how they got into farming and became successful entrepreneurs despite the barriers they encountered in agricultural institutions, farming communities, and even their own families. Their strategies for obtaining land and labor and developing successful businesses offer models for other aspiring farmers. Pulling down the barriers that women face requires organizations and institutions to become informed by what the authors call a feminist agrifood systems theory (FAST). This framework values women’s ways of knowing and working in agriculture: emphasizing personal, economic, and environmental sustainability, creating connections through the food system, and developing networks that emphasize collaboration and peer-to-peer education. The creation and growth of a specific organization, the Pennsylvania Women’s Agricultural Network, offers a blueprint for others seeking to incorporate a feminist agrifood systems approach into agricultural programming. The theory has the potential to shift how farmers, agricultural professionals, and anyone else interested in farming think about gender and sustainability, as well as to change how feminist scholars and theorists think about agriculture. © 2016 by the University of Iowa Press.","","","","","","","","","2011 Organic Industry Survey, (2011); Abraham M., Purkayastha B., Making a Difference: Linking Research and Action in Practice, Pedagogy, and Policy for Social Justice: Introduction, Current Sociology, 60, 2, pp. 123-141, (2012); Acker J., Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations, Gender and Society, 20, pp. 441-464, (2006); Adams J., The Transformation of Rural Life: Southern Illinois, 1890-1990, (1994); Adams R., Kelsey T.W., Pennsylvania Dairy Farms and Marcellus Shale, 2007-2010, (2012); Agarwal B., The Gender and Environment Debate: Lessons from India, Feminist Studies, 18, 1, pp. 119-158, (1992); Allen P., Sachs C., Women in Food Chains: The Gendered Politics of Food, International Journal of Sociology of Food and Agriculture, 15, 1, pp. 1-23, (2007); Alsgaard H., Rural Inheritance: Gender Disparities in Farm Transmission, North Dakota Law Review, 88, pp. 347-409, (2013); (2015); Growing Strong: American Farm Bureau Womens Leadership Program.”, (2015); Antecol H., Kuhn P., Gender as an Impediment to Labor Market Success: Why Do Young Women Report Greater Harm?, Journal of Labor Economics, 18, 4, pp. 702-728, (2000); Barbercheck M.E., Brasier K.J., Kiernan N.E., Sachs C., Trauger A., Use of Conservation Practices by Women Farmers in the Northeastern United States, Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems, 29, pp. 65-82, (2012); Barbercheck M.E., Brasier K.J., Kiernan N.E., Sachs C., Trauger A., Findeis J., Meeting the Extension Needs of Women Farmers: A Perspective from Pennsylvania, Journal of Extension, 47, 3, (2009); Benbrook C.M., Impacts of Genetically Engineered Crops on Pesticide Use in the U.S.-the First Sixteen Years, Environmental Science Europe, 24, (2012); Beus C., Dunlap R., Conventional vs. Alternative Agriculture: The Paradigmatic Roots of the Debate, Rural Sociology, 55, 4, pp. 590-616, (1990); Black A.M., What Did That Program Do?

Misogynistic speech is a kind of abusive language, which can be simplified as hate speech targeting women, and it is becoming a more and more relevant issue in recent years. AMI IberEval 2018 and AMI EVALITA 2018 were two shared tasks which mainly focused on tackling the problem of misogyny in Twitter, in three different languages, namely English, Italian, and Spanish. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on the phenomena of misogyny in those three languages, by focusing on three main objectives. Firstly, we investigate the most important features to detect misogyny and the issues which contribute to the difficulty of misogyny detection, by proposing a novel system and conducting a broad evaluation on this task. Secondly, we study the relationship between misogyny and other abusive language phenomena, by conducting a series of cross-domain classification experiments. Finally, we explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny in a multilingual environment, by carrying out cross-lingual classification experiments. Our system succeeded to outperform all state of the art systems in all benchmark AMI datasets both subtask A and subtask B. Moreover, intriguing insights emerged from error analysis, in particular about the interaction between different but related abusive phenomena. Based on our cross-domain experiment, we conclude that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while we experimentally found that it is different from sexism. Lastly, our cross-lingual experiments show promising results. Our proposed joint-learning architecture obtained a robust performance across languages, worth to be explored in further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive language online; Automatic misogyny identification; Cross-domain classification; Cross-lingual classification; Social media","Data processing; Information management; Cross-domain; Cross-lingual; Important features; In-depth study; Joint learning; Multilingual environments; Robust performance; State-of-the-art system; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Ahluwalia R., Soni H., Callow E., Nascimento A.C.A., Cock M.D., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets, Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-6, (2018); Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on Twitter, Natural language processing and information systems - 23rd international conference on applications of natural language to information systems, NLDB 2018, paris, france, june 13-15, 2018, proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10859, pp. 57-64, (2018); Artetxe M., Schwenk H., Massively multilingual sentence embeddings for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and beyond, TACL, 7, pp. 597-610, (2019); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web companion, perth, australia, april 3-7, 2017, pp. 759-760, (2017); Bakarov A., Vector space models for automatic misogyny identification (short paper), Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-3, (2018); Basile A., Rubagotti C., Crotonemilano for AMI at evalita2018.

Research on WOC in engineering is usually drawn from all of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which does little to illuminate the nuanced experiences of WOC within engineering culture. We sought a primary emphasis on persistence and perseverance rather than the typical examinations on mentoring, inventions, work-life balance, or the challenges that WOC face in engineering faculty environments. There are few studies on how and why women of color persist in academia in the face of the intersection of racism and sexism. Using intersectionality as a theoretical framework and inductive qualitative analyses of interviews with 56 women of color who identified as Asian, Black, Latina, and/or multiracial, we analyzed the sources of support for their persistence. Asking which collective factors support WOC in general and which are unique to each of the racial/ gender groups, we identified three major themes-persistence is aided by (1) supportive colleagues internal to the department or institution, (2) supportive colleagues external to the institution, and (3) the intersectional considerations of group-specific nuances shared by Black, Latina, and Asian women engineering faculty members. The implications suggest women of color thrive in departments with supportive faculty, proactive leadership, and a commitment to professional development. We outline specific racial group interventions that can be beneficial for Asian, Black, and Latina engineering faculty. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.","Asian faculty; Black faculty; Engineering; Faculty; Higher education; Intersectionality; Latina faculty; Multicultural faculty; Persistence; Women of color","","","","","","","","Agosto V., Karanxha Z., Resistance meets spirituality in academia: ""I prayed on it!, Negro Educational Review, 62, 1-4, (2011); Aguirre A., Women and minority faculty in the academic workplace: Recruitment, retention, and academic culture, ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Report, 27, 6, (2000); Aldridge J.

Social media networks are rapidly developing. As a result, misogyny is becoming increasingly fashionable. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically classifying misogynistic Bengali messages on social media platforms. Several procedures have been taken to preprocess the data. Tf-Idf and Word Embedding with BERT are implemented so that computers can read text. Several machine learning-based models including Random Forest, SVM Polynomial kernel, SVM Signal kernel, and Adaptive Boosting have been tested to build a multi-class analyzer that identifies Misogynistic text in Bengali on social media. The models have been evaluated with the performance measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. With 62.61 percent accuracy, the SVM sigmoid kernel outperforms all other models. As per our knowledge, no earlier research has been conducted on the classification of Bengali misogynistic text; consequently, the current research is the most comprehensive to date.  © 2022 IEEE.","bert; machine learning; misogynistic text; multi-class; text classification","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Random forests; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Text processing; Bengalis; Bert; Machine-learning; Misogynistic text; Multi-class; Preprocess; Social media; Social media networks; Social media platforms; Text classification; Adaptive boosting","","","","","","","Kemp S., Digital 2022: Bangladesh; Ahluwalia R., Soni H., Callow E., Nascimento A., De Cock M., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets, EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 12, (2018); Fersini E., Nozza D., Rosso P., Ami@ evalita2020: Automatic misogyny identification, EVALITA, (2020); Ou X., Li H., Ynu-oxz@ haspeede 2 and ami: Xlm-roberta with ordered neurons lstm for classification task at evalita 2020, EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 2765, pp. 102-109, (2020); Datta A., Si S., Chakraborty U., Naskar S.K., Spyder: Aggression detection on multilingual tweets, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying, pp. 87-92, (2020); Alawneh E., Al-Fawa'Reh M., Jafar M.T., Al Fayoumi M., Sentiment analysis-based sexual harassment detection using machine learning techniques, 2021 international symposium on electronics and smart devices (ISESD).

Several studies have been conducted using autonomic signal processing to examine men and women differences during the exposure of affective stimuli. Emotional pictures and music are two commonly used methods to induce affects in an experimental setup. The biological changes have been commonly monitored during a certain emotional inducement protocol, solely. This study was aimed to examine two induction paradigms involved auditory and visual cues using nonlinear dynamical approaches. To this end, various nonlinear parameters of galvanic skin response (GSR) and pulse signals of men and women were examined. The nonlinear analysis was performed using lagged Poincare parameters, detrended fluctuation indices (DFAs), Lyapunov exponents (LEs), some entropy measures, and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to show significant differences between the groups. The results indicate that besides the type of affect induction, physiological differences of men and women are notable in negative emotions (sadness and fear). Regardless to the inducements, lagged Poincare parameters of the pulse signals and DFA indices of the GSR have shown significant differences in gender affective responses. However, applying pictorial stimuli, LEs are appropriate indicators for gender discrimination. It is also concluded that GSR dynamics are intensely affected by the kind of stimuli; while this is not validated for the pulse. These findings suggest that different emotional inductions evoked different autonomic responses in men and women, which can be appropriately monitored using nonlinear signal processing approaches. © 2016 National Taiwan University.","Emotion;

Several machine and deep learning approaches have been proposed recently for detecting various types of aggressive behavior. However, social media are fast paced, generating an increasing amount of content, while aggressive behavior evolves over time. In this work, we introduce the first, practical, real-time framework for detecting aggression on Twitter via embracing the streaming machine learning paradigm. Our method adapts its ML classifiers in an incremental fashion as it receives new annotated examples and is able to achieve the same (or even higher) performance as batch-based ML models, with over 90% accuracy, precision, and recall. At the same time, our experimental analysis on real Twitter data reveals how our framework can easily scale to accommodate the entire Twitter Firehose (of 778 million tweets per day) with only 3 commodity machines. Finally, we show that our framework is general enough to detect other related behaviors such as sarcasm, racism, and sexism in real time. © 2020 IEEE.","online aggression detection; social media; streaming machine learning","Big data; Deep learning; E-learning; Social networking (online); Experimental analysis; Fire-hose; Learning approach; Online aggressions; Real time; Social media; Learning systems","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691025, 830927)","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research leading to these results has received funding from the EU’s H2020 Programme, No 691025 (MSCA-RISE project ENCASE) and No 830927 (project CONCORDIA).

However, research specific to STEM pedagogical practices (e.g., curricular design, classroom instruc-tion, student support) is missing from this literature, which can provide discipline-specific insights on affirming classroom practices for this population. Reform in undergraduate STEM curriculum and instruction has largely focused on supporting all students, which upholds the guise of neutrality while leaving unchallenged the interlocking functions of cisheteropatriarchy and white supremacy. As a response to the JWM themed issue’s call for reimagining STEM higher education research, this position paper proposes a queer of color research agenda to generate alternative approaches for undergraduate pedagogy that disrupt the violence of neutrality in STEM. Our agenda makes a twofold contribution. First, we extend research on racism and misogyny in undergraduate STEM classrooms by exploring how cisheteropatriarchy informs variation in racially minoritized students’ experiences of pedagogical practices when considering minoritized gender and sexual identities. Second, the agenda brings a focus on STEM pedagogy to research on QTSOC, which has been overlooked despite its impact on students’ academic persistence and disciplinary identity constructions. The position paper concludes with implications for departmental faculty, college/university leaders, and federal agencies to assist the development of educational practice and policies that disrupt STEM neutrality responsible for marginalization among undergraduate QTSOC. © 2022 by Begell House, Inc.","curriculum; instruction; LGBTQ; queer of color; undergraduate students","","","","","","","","Appiah K.

Guided by theoretical frameworks from Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Critical Race Theory (CRT), a convenience sample of 14 science and mathematics teachers participated in a series of virtual chats using open-ended questioning and facilitated by two university instructors. Using conversation and critical discourse analyses, three primary themes emerged: understanding of issues related to stereotypes, encouragement of females and minorities to pursue careers in STEM, and the place for diversity discussions in science and mathematics classrooms. The teachers felt burdened by curricular and administrative constraints that inhibit their ability to participate in thought-provoking critical conversations. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways teachers can assist in the STEM career identity development of their underrepresented females and students of color and calls for research that combines the key findings in SCCT and CRT to build confidence and capacity for teachers to effectively confront issues of racism, sexism, and stereotyping in science and mathematics classrooms. © 2019 School Science and Mathematics Association","classroom discourse;

To explore how current automated hate speech detection approaches perform in detecting this type of hate, we evaluated the performance of two state-of-the-art detection tools, HateSonar and Google’s Perspective API, on a balanced dataset of 300 tweets, half of which are examples of misogynoir and half of which are examples of supporting Black women and an imbalanced dataset of 3138 tweets of which 162 tweets are examples of misogynoir and 2976 tweets are examples of allyship tweets. We aim to determine if these tools flag these messages under any of their classifications of hateful speech (e.g. “hate speech”, “offensive language”, “toxicity” etc.). Close analysis of the classifications and errors shows that current hate speech detection tools are ineffective in detecting misogynoir. They lack sensitivity to context, which is an essential component for misogynoir detection. We found that tweets likely to be classified as hate speech explicitly reference racism or sexism or use profane or aggressive words. Subtle tweets without references to these topics are more challenging to classify. We find that the lack of sensitivity to context may make such tools not only ineffective but potentially harmful to Black women. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media","Social networking (online); 'current; Detection approach; Detection tools; Hate detection; Hate speech; Intersectionality; Misogynoir; Public response; Social media; Speech detection; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Bailey A., On anger, silence, and epistemic injustice, Royal Instit Philos Suppl, 84, pp. 93-115, (2018); Bailey M., Trudy R., On misogynoir: citation, erasure, and plagiarism, Fem Med Stud, 18, 4, pp. 762-768, (2018); Barbour R.S., Checklists for improving rigour in qualitative research: a case of the tail wagging the dog?, BMJ, 322, 7294, pp. 1115-1117, (2001); Bonds A., Race and ethnicity ii: white women and the possessive geographies of white supremacy, Prog Hum Geogr, 44, 4, pp. 778-788, (2020); Cao R., Lee R.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12Th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 11-20, (2020); Chandra M., Pailla D., Bhatia H., Sanchawala A., Gupta M., Shrivastava M., Kumaraguru P., Subverting the Jewtocracy, Online Antisemitism Detection Using Multimodal Deep Learning, pp. 148-157, (2021); Collins P.H., Intersectionality as critical social theory, (2019); Crenshaw K.W., On Intersectionality: Essential Writings, (2017); Davidson T., Bhattacharya D., Weber I., Racial Bias in Hate Speech and Abusive Language Detection Datasets, (2019); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, 11, 1, (2017); Douglass S., Mirpuri S., English D., Yip T., They were just making jokes: ethnic/racial teasing and discrimination among adolescents, Cult Divers Ethnic Minority Psychol, 22, 1, (2016); Eddo-Lodge R., Why i’m no longer talking to white people about race, (2020); Elsherief M., Kulkarni V., Nguyen D., Wang W.Y., Belding E., Hate lingo: A target-based linguistic analysis of hate speech in social media, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 12, (2018); Epstein R., Blake J., Gonzalez T., Girlhood interrupted: The erasure of black girls’ childhood, (2017); Farrell T., Fernandez M., Novotny J., Alani H., Exploring misogyny across the manosphere in reddit, Proceedings of the 10Th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 87-96, (2019); Fereday J., Muir-Cochrane E., Demonstrating rigor using thematic analysis: a hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and theme development, Int J Qual Methods, 5, 1, pp. 80-92, (2006); Fitzsimons A., ) Intersectional identities and machine learning: Illuminating language biases in twitter algorithms, Hicss, pp. 1-10, (2022); Fortuna P., Nunes S., A survey on automatic detection of hate speech in text, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51, 4, pp. 1-30, (2018); Gomez R., Gibert J., Gomez L., Karatzas D., Exploring Hate Speech Detection in Multimodal Publications, (2019); Gorrell G., Bakir M.E., Greenwood M.A., Roberts I., Bontcheva K., Race and Religion in Online Abuse Towards UK Politicians.

Working collaboratively, the researchers infused concepts of gender; masculinity; sexism and discrimination within the engineering curriculum in 2016 and 2017 and ran semi structured focus groups with 17 CEM female students from these years. The intention was to establish their experiences of sexism (hegemonic patriarchy) in their professional environment and to identify their responses. The findings demonstrate that female students question the authenticity of their inclusion in the workplace. The data shows an internalised patriarchy by the female students, who rationalise the sexist behaviour and/or over perform to be seen as equal to male colleagues within the work place. The research concludes that there are sexist practices that affect females' ability to develop as professionals within the construction workplace. Recommendations focus on appropriate curriculum responses and professional development skills and suggest upskilling students to invoke change within their future workplace. This gender research is important to South Africa where increased employment of women in construction is legislated.","Construction industry; Gender; Health; Socialisation; Women","Computational electromagnetics; Construction industry; Curricula; Health; Project management; Social sciences; Engineering curriculum; Gender; Professional development skills; Professional environments; Socialisation; University of Cape Town; Women; Women in constructions; Students","","","","","","","Babbie E., Mouton J., The Practice of Social Research, (2002); Johnston H., Voting for Change?

The phenomenon, also known as Catcalling, recently gained renewed attention in public discussions initiated by social media activists. Combining VR with interactive instruction settings known from museums might be a promising way to effectively reach victims, bystanders, and aggressors alike and obtain a lasting attitude and behavior change. We present a virtual gallery where visitors can explore a variety of curated interactive multimedia material intended to inform, raise awareness, inspire empathy, perspective-taking, and behavioral change. With interactions such as a self-assessment test, as well as opportunities for visitors to leave feedback and thoughts in the gallery, this virtual world can be used as a sensitization tool.

While these attitudes are measured as outcomes of prevention programs, students’ preexisting attitudes toward sexual violence shape how prevention programs are received by the students who participate in such programs. This quantitative study examines clusters of student attitudes within a single high school. Students in grades nine through 12 (N = 626) completed a survey measuring rape myth acceptance, hostile sexism and traditionalism, and empathy for survivors. Using K-Means cluster analysis, the authors identified five clusters of students by attitudes toward sexual violence: Progressive/Feminist, Rape Justifying Attitudes, Victim-Blaming Moderate, Perpetrator-Excusing Moderate, and Traditionalist. Implications of these findings for prevention programming are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Attitudes toward sexual violence; cluster analysis; prevention programming; secondary school","","","","","","","","Aldenderfer M.S., Blashfield R.K., Cluster Analysis, (1984);

An exception is the randomized controlled trial of Green Dot, found effective in reducing violence rates and violence acceptance in 26 high-schools (2010–2014). In ‘Life’s Snapshot’, 10,727 seniors were recruited from these same schools with the goal of determining the longer-term efficacy of bystander training. Students in intervention schools could have up to three years of Green Dot exposure. Seniors from intervention versus control schools had significantly lower scores (p <.01) indicating less violence acceptance or sexism for two of five measures. Seniors’ self-reports of bystander training received confirmed these findings. These cross-sectional analyses suggest that some reductions in violence acceptance associated with bystander programming may be maintained into early adulthood. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bystander intervention;

The perpetrators of these attacks explain their actions as necessary to stem an “invasion” of immigrants which threatens the very existence of the white race. At the same time, many of the same countries have experienced very similar attacks motivated by a particularly contemporary form of misogyny. Known as incels, an abbreviation of involuntary celibate, young men in this community believe they are denied sexual partners by feminism and societal norms of male attractiveness. These two series of attacks are generally understood to be separate (if overlapping) forms of extremism. In this article I contend that the concepts of white genocide central to white nationalism and misogynistic incelism are more intertwined than it appears. Misogyny and the notion of white genocide are mutually escalatory. Rather than separate and complementary forms of extremism, the two ideologies converge to create a single more volatile worldview, one which makes its proponents more prone to the use of violence. Misogyny and white genocide are synergistic, their effect greater than the sum of their parts. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","incels; misogyny; terrorism; White genocide; white nationalism","","","","","","","","","C.

We have moved from little or no studies on women to now departments of women and gender studies, centers for women and gender studies and in some countries, at the federal level, a ministry of women affairs. One way to look at gender studies is the way gender has been constructed, represented and enforced. For example, has the roles of both boys and girls beginning in the home, school, family and the workplace from traditional through colonial to post - colonial period changed? How have men and women been represented in literature, history texts, the media from pre-colonial to post-colonial era etc? How are expectations and roles ascribed to either sex been enforced? Another focus in the discussion and study of gender has been on the empowerment of women, the struggle for women to have a voice and to be heard and how to mitigate the strictures and traditions that perpetually work to keep women down. The issues of power, reproductive rights and body politics, violence against women in all its forms including rape, sex slavery, female gender mutilation, health policy and disparities, education for women and women and poverty reduction etc have also been fertile areas of study. African feminists address the place of women in society and according to Arndt (2002), African women and men ""suffer not only from sexism and patriarchal social structures, but are also victims of racism, neo-colonialism, cultural imperialism, religious fundamentalism, socio-economic mechanisms of oppression and dictatorial and/or corrupt systems"" (p. 73). This introduction sets out to discuss the conditions that have given rise to the growth of women studies programs in Africa, some of the programs in the universities and how this book fits into the current research and studies in women and g ender studies. © 2016 Sense Publishers.

This can lead to severe physical and psychological stress in young children and adolescents, leading to even suicides and negatively affecting social policies. Therefore, there is a significant need to identify and regulate harassing content posted on the Internet in a smart, automated, and accurate manner. With this aim, in this paper, we design and develop a hierarchical framework comprising machine learning algorithms in order of higher computational complexity to adaptatively switch among them for efficiently detecting hateful and abusive content. We combine simple machine learning models such as Naive Bayes/Logistic Regression classifiers with customized calibration and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, and compare them with the much stronger deep learning techniques. Our proposed hierarchical framework demonstrates a significant improvement of the automated detection of abusive contents in social networks with a relatively small twitter dataset in contrast with the deep learning-based counterpart, namely the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, training of which typically requires a much higher volume of labeled documents to detect abusive comments. © 2022 IEEE.","Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT); calibration; Cyberbully; Expectation-Maximization (EM); Naive Bayes; racism","Automation; Classifiers; Computational efficiency; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machinery; Maximum principle; Signal encoding; Social networking (online); Automated detection; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Cyberbully; Expectation Maximization; Expectation-maximization; Learning approach; Naive bayes; Online users; Physical stress; Racism; Calibration","","","","","Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia, (449)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this work through the project number 449.","Hamm M.P., Et al., Prevalence and effect of cyberbullying on children and young people: A scoping review of social media studies, JAMA pediatrics, 169, 8, pp. 770-777, (2015); Geiger A., How and why we studied teens and cyberbullying, Pew Research Center, (2018); Niu G., Et al., Cyberbullying victimization and adolescent depression: The mediating role of psychological security and the moderating role of growth mindset, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 12, (2020); Alam K.S., Bhowmik S., Prosun P.R.K., Cyberbullying detection: An ensemble based machine learning approach, 2021 Third International Conference on Intelligent Communication Technologies and Virtual Mobile Networks (ICICV), (2021); Behzadi M., Harris I.G., Derakhshan A., Rapid cyber-bullying detection method using compact BERT models, 2021 IEEE 15th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), (2021); Gada M., Damania K., Sankhe S., Cyberbullying detection using LSTM-CNN architecture and its applications, 2021 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), (2021); Tang D., Et al., Learning sentiment-specific word embedding for Twitter sentiment classification, ACL, pp. 1555-1565, (2014); Nguyen K., O'Connor B., Posterior calibration and exploratory analysis for natural language processing models, (2015); McCallum A.K., Multi-label text classification with a mixture model trained by EM, AAAI 99 Workshop on Text Learning, (1999); Founta A.-M., Et al., Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of Twitter abusive behavior, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; Huawei; LG; Qualcomm; Samsung; Technology Innovation Institute (TII)","2022 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2022","16 May 2022 through 20 May 2022","Seoul","182043","15503607","978-153868347-7","","","English","IEEE Int Conf Commun","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137271143"

The complexity of recognizing misogyny through computer models lies in the fact that it is a subtle type of violence, it is not always explicitly aggressive, and it can even hide behind seemingly flattering words, jokes, parodies, and other expressions. Cur-rently, it is even difficult to have an exact figure for the rate of misogynistic comments online because, unlike other types of violence, such as physical violence, these events are not registered by any statis-tical systems. This research contributes to the development of models for the automatic detection of misogynistic texts in Latin American Spanish and contributes to the design of data augmentation methodologies since the amount of data required for deep learning models is considerable. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, this manuscript analyzes Black women’s perceived expectations regarding what they believed their doctoral programs would be like prior to their enrollment in graduate school versus their actual experiences as doctoral students (n = 37). Findings conclude that Black women expected their coursework would either be academically rigorous or not very difficult at all, and that their faculty advisors would provide them with tailored academic and social support. In addition, some of the Black women also expected that they would not have to deal with racism and sexism under the assumption that their respective departments were inclusive and equitable. Black women’s actual experiences consisted of unsupportive faculty, surprising levels of racism and sexism, and an obligation to code-switch. This article also discusses the implications of the findings, and strategies for helping Black women succeed in engineering and computing doctoral programs are also discussed. © 2022 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.","Black women; code-switching; discrimination; doctoral students; engineering and computing doctoral programs; faculty advisement","","","","","","","","Adams W.

In a collaborative inquiry into the practices of two youth media producers, we explore how these counternarrative efforts are forms of restorying, in which young people write themselves into existence in ways that can reconfigure school spaces. Framed in Black feminist and critical cosmopolitan perspectives, this article considers how young people use new media tools in school to engage the narrative imagination and build the worlds they want to live in, simultaneously representing the political histories and realities of their everyday worlds and imagining alternative futures. We explore the ways schools can create opportunities for youth to engage in these new media practices that re-author themselves and the institutional spaces they encounter–and how these opportunities are situated within broader intersectional forms of systemic inequity and oppression. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescent literacies; cosmopolitics; critical literacy; identity; writing","","","","","","Collaborative Design School","We are incredibly thankful to work with Gabriel and Sara in this project as well as the staff and students of the Collaborative Design School.

Previous studies have confirmed that exposure to this online social intimidation can have very serious offline consequences. With the growth of these multimodal social media platforms, there is an urgent requirement of some device methods for social intimidation detection and prevention. However, most of the prior research has focused on only textual posts for one or two topics of intimidation, namely sexism and racism. The principal objective of this research is to recognize social intimidation from multimodal posts such as text, memes, videos and audio and to target various social media networks such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for several topics of harassment, namely religion based, personal attack, racism, sexism, physical appearance, etc. Previous research has stopped at detection, but this research has taken one step ahead to test the severity based on hate prediction score. The research study is performed using a combination of big data technology, namely Apache Spark, and several deep learning methods which are described below. The system is validated on five public datasets i.e., MLMA Hate Speech Dataset, MMHS150K Dataset, Hateful Memes Dataset, Instagram, Vine Dataset and measured on the basis of precision, recall and f1-score. Performance of the system has been inspected individually for every category of post under three subsections. The results attained specify that the proposed approach gives more feasible solution for social intimidation detection and its severity in online social networking platforms.  © 2022 Totem Publisher, Inc.","Apache Spark;

This percentage, however, is not due to a lack of interest or capacity, but to discrimination against women, sexual harassment and work safety. The purpose of this paper is to identify the main issues and current difficulties of women workers at construction sites, as well as good practices that might provide a better environment for them. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were carried out with workers and engineers who work/have worked at construction sites, to gather material for a discussion about the gender gap in this environment. The interviews were structured and analyzed around the following topics: acceptance, well-being, installations, gender perception and good practices. Findings: The hiring of women usually occurs at the end of the construction period, which brings up the issue of sexual division of labor. Effects of the glass ceiling and the leaky pipeline phenomena were evident, as well as harassment, discrimination and sexism. Originality/value: Studies about women in engineering have been become relative common, but studies about female workers on construction sites are still scarce. The women interviewed see themselves as warriors, symbolizing the gain of space within the construction sector and in society. It is hoped that the results can contribute to raising awareness about the benefits of gender mainstreaming at construction sites and to promote the health and well-being of women in these environments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction site; Interview; Management","Construction industry; Management; Construction period; Construction sectors; Construction sites; Design/methodology/approach; Interview; Sexual harassment; Women in constructions; Women in engineering; Professional aspects","","","","","","","Aboagye-Nimo E., Collinson J., Wood H., Jin R., Wyche K., Women as construction professionals: modern day challenges, Joint CIB W099 and TG59 Conference Coping with the Complexity of Safety, Health, and Wellbeing in Construction, Salvador, University of Brighton, pp. 370-378, (2018); Ahuja V., Kumari S., Issues and challenges for women in construction industry: global as well as Indian perspective, Regional Conference of the International Network of Women Engineers & Scientists, (2012); Aigbavboa C., Oke A., Aghimien D., Dithebe K., Mogane P., Minimising rape incidents in the South African construction industry – A Gauteng case study, Joint CIB W099 and TG59 Conference Coping with the Complexity of Safety, Health, and Wellbeing in Construction, Salvador, University of Johannesburg, pp. 362-369, (2018); Andrade T., Mulheres no mercado de trabalho: onde nasce a desigualdade?

Four coders engaged in content analysis on the video-recordings as well as transcripts of the video data in two rounds. Overall, our analysis revealed that the women in our study experienced discrimination, expectations from others that are too high or too low, isolation, sexism, and racism; yet they still choose to stay in the discipline.

The initiative called for providing $4 billion in funding for states to increase access to CS in K-12 through teacher training, curriculum development, and partnerships with $100 million provided directly for districts; over $135 million in investments over five years by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to support and train CS teachers; and a call to action for state and city leaders, educators, philanthropists, creative media and technology professions, and others to get involved in supporting this initiative [24].","Allen S., Daley K., The Effects of Father Involvement: An Updated Research Summary of Evidence, (2007); Biller H.B., Fathers and Families: Paternal Factors in Child Development, (1993); Burge J.D., Thomas J.O., Yamaguchi R., Follow-Up Workshop: Computing and Intersectionality: The Social and Behavioral Structures at Play for Black Women in the Computing Sciences, (2017); Burge J.D., Thomas J.O., Yamaguchi R., Computing and Intersectionality: The Social and Behavioral Structures at Play for Black Women in the Computing Sciences, (2016); Carbado D.W., Gulati M., The fifth black woman, Journal of Contemporary Legal Issues, 11, pp. 701-729, (2000); Colby S., Ortman J., Projections of the Size and Composition of the U.

These vectors are used to improve the quality of generative and predictive models. Recent studies demonstrate that word embeddings contain and amplify biases present in data, such as stereotypes and prejudice. In this study, we provide a complete overview of bias in word embeddings. We develop a new technique for bias detection for gendered languages and use it to compare bias in embeddings trained on Wikipedia and on political social media data. We investigate bias diffusion and prove that existing biases are transferred to further machine learning models. We test two techniques for bias mitigation and show that the generally proposed methodology for debiasing models at the embeddings level is insufficient. Finally, we employ biased word embeddings and illustrate that they can be used for the detection of similar biases in new data. Given that word embeddings are widely used by commercial companies, we discuss the challenges and required actions towards fair algorithmic implementations and applications. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Bias; Detection; Diffusion; Fairness; Homophobia; Mitigation; Racism; Sexism; Word embeddings","Diffusion; Error detection; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Transparency; Bias; Fairness; Homophobia; Mitigation; Racism; Sexism; Embeddings","","","","","","","Which Jobs Do Men and Women Do?

Previous qualitative research demonstrates experiences of gender and race-based discrimination in engineering graduate education. Women and men from marginalized racial backgrounds experience discrimination and unfair treatment from advisors, peers, and faculty during graduate education and research. Similarly, women experience gender-based discrimination throughout their graduate education from faculty and peers in classrooms, labs, and other education spaces. However, the prevalence of these experiences has not been well documented. In this paper, we report the frequency of discrimination and unfair treatment in graduate engineering education, and those rates by race/ethnicity and gender. We conducted a national survey of engineering graduate programs stratified by discipline, state, program size, and university size. The resulting sample included 913 engineering doctoral students from 113 universities representing 23 engineering disciplines. The descriptive statistics from this survey provide evidence of the types, frequency, and pervasive nature of academic mistreatment and discrimination in engineering graduate education. Participants responded to nine items about unfair treatment and completed the Discrimination in Engineering Graduate Engineering (DEGrE) scale, a measure of bias and discrimination experienced by engineering graduate students. The DEGrE scale includes 25 items across six constructs. Nineteen percent of participants experienced unfair treatment during their doctoral education. In addition, the responses to the DEGrE scale show students observe and experience discrimination against women as well as students from marginalized racial and ethnic groups from advisors, faculty, and peers in classrooms, labs, and other education environments. More than 14% of students from marginalized racial and ethnic backgrounds agreed that racism has caused them to consider leaving engineering. Similarly, 36% of women agreed that peers try to exert authority over them because of their gender. The prevalence of racism and sexism from this national survey highlight the necessity of addressing inequality within engineering doctoral education. This paper sets a foundation for continued research assessing progress towards equity and justice in engineering graduate programs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.","Gender; Graduate; Race/Ethnicity","Engineering education; Professional aspects; Surveys; Doctoral education; Engineering graduate programs; Engineering graduates; Gender; Graduate; Graduate education; National surveys; Race/ethnicity; Research papers; Student experiences; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (EEC # 1763288)","Primary Advisor Peer Graduate Student Post-Doctoral Staff Undergraduate Students Has your primary advisor spoken inappropriately to you?

Thriving in the online Manosphere, the involuntary celibates, or “Incels,” are men who feel they have been victimized by feminism. Initially just another misogynist social group online, this article argues that Incels are moving beyond social commentary to become a political movement. This article demonstrates that Incels have begun to craft a particularly violent political ideology drawing on a unique form of misogyny rooted in the construction of a counternarrative to hegemonic masculinity. Using critical narrative analysis, this article assesses the discourse and narratives used by the Incels to create their unique worldview and identifies core components of their emerging political ideology to understand how this group may justify the use of political violence as part of their political movement. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.","ideology; Incel; Manosphere; Misogyny; political violence","","","","","","","","","S.

What about other socially constructed identities? Although diversity and inclusion have become important topics discussed and researched within engineering education, these are not easy concepts for most engineering educators to discuss with students in the classroom. In this paper, we describe examples of class activities that we have used in two engineering courses to help students learn about privilege, its relationship to differentisms, such as racism, sexism, classism, ableism, and heterosexism, and the role engineering plays/can play in maintaining or dismantling that privilege. Specifically, we describe activities in a required User Centered Design course for first or second year students, and an Engineering and Social Justice course required for third year students in General Engineering and open as an elective to other engineering majors. As engineering professors, we also describe our own positionality as the instructors. We hope that these examples will be helpful to others interested in integrating such content into their courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation’s REvolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments; National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Research and Economic Development, University of California, Riverside, RED, (1519453); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: The authors wish to thank the National Science Foundation’s REvolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments (RED) program through Award #1519453 for support of this collaborative effort.

Conflating the act of writing a book–a thesis against institutional misogyny–with the construction of an imaginary city, the first work, The Book of the City of Ladies, 1405, has been seen as a proto-feminist manifesto. I focus on the under-researched architectural and urban allegory depicted in the text, which imagines a utopia inhabited solely by women and constructed for them by a woman and on the manuscript's accompanying illuminations displaying three different stages of the construction of the city. Inspired by Aristotle’s Politics and revisiting the ancient Greek metaphor, by which a state or society and its institutions are conceived of as a biological human body, in The Book of the Body Politic, 1404, de Pizan offers her version of a medieval political theory, which I connect with her allegorical city. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","allegory; architecture; body politic; Christine de Pizan; digital film; feminist city; practice-led research","","","","","","Architecture Research Fund; Bartlett School of Architecture; University College London, UCL","The research was kindly funded the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL, Architecture Research Fund, and culminated with an exhibition, “City of Ladies” hosted by Domobaal Gallery in January–February 2020.

In particular, the Technology and Computing space have always struggled to recruit and retain women. A similar trend is seen in employment, where approximately 25% of computing jobs are held by women 2. Within Brigham Young University's Information Technology program, we have struggled to achieve 10% female enrollment. This is unfortunate, as it is the universal opinion of our own faculty, supported by both internal and external research data that gender balance enables peak productivity. It is thus extremely unfortunate that elements of society are still struggling with mistaken gender stereotypes, and that this, coupled with occasional misogyny can dissuade young women from pursuing a career in computing. While this may not be the only cause, it is unacceptable. We have found (in line with other research) that strong faculty mentorship is an important factor in recruiting and retaining women in technology computing disciplines. This paper thus describes the approaches implemented by a cybersecurity research group of over 20 students in achieving a 2: 3 female to male participation ratio within a program of less than 10% female enrollment. There have been significant immediate and long-term benefits to establishing this ratio in a research group. These include a measurable increase in research productivity from both genders, peer-to-peer mentoring, and a more complete perspective into the significance and impact of research overall. In the past four years, female students have participated in both pedagogical and technical research conferences, obtained research funding and developed entire courses. One particular effect of significance has been an increase in direct, targeted recruitment of women into the program - and subsequently from the program by employers. We anecdotally note also that women in cybersecurity command a higher average placement wage than men, although regret that to date, this data is not statistically significant due to insufficient data samples. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","","","","","","","","","Blume-Kohout M.E., Understanding the Gender Gap in STEM Fields Entrepreneurship, (2014); Khanna D., We Need More Women in Tech: The Data Proves It, (2013); Lev-Ram M., The powerful Woman behind intel's new $300 million diversity initiative, Fortune, (2015); Wilhelm A., Intel Promises $300M to Boost the Representation of Women and Minorities in Tech, (2015); McGregor J., Is Intel's Diversity Goal Really that ""bold""?, (2015); Bridging the Gender Gap: Growing the Next Generation of Women in Computing, (2014); Olson R., Percentage of Bachelor's Degrees Conferred to Women, by Major (1970-2012), (2014); Caldwell T., Plugging the cyber-security skills gap, Computer Fraud & Security, 2013, 7, pp. 5-10, (2013); Leclair J., Lifang S., Sherly A., Women in STEM and cyber security fields, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference for Industry and Education Collaboration, (2014); Dampier D.A., Kelly K., Carr K., Increasing participation of women in cyber security, 2012 ASEE Southeast Section Conference, (2012); Fuller A., Turbin J., Johnson B., Computer club for girls: The problem with seeing girls as the problem, Gender and Education, 25, 4, pp. 499-514, (2013); The Center for Women and Information Technology (CWIT), The Center for Women & Information Technology: Mentoring Tool Kit, (2004)","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","2015 122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition","14 June 2015 through 17 June 2015","Seattle","113020","21535965","","","","English","ASEE Annu.

The user has freedom to post whatever he/she likes in social networking and blogging sites. However, sometimes the content when directed towards certain group of individuals with an intention to incite hate or discrimination, causes a turmoil in the society. Such content is known as hate speech. Hate speech can be a serious problem to peace and harmony in the society. There are instances where hate speech have led to social unrest and extremism. Thus, hate speech in the internet needs to be monitored. In this paper, we discuss the relevant works done in the field of hate speech detection. Different types of hate speech like racism, sexism, religious hate speech, etc. and the various methods proposed to tackle them are discussed. Further, we identify the challenges and propose the solutions to challenges in hate speech detection in the public internet sphere.  © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Racism; Sexism","Natural language processing systems; Speech; Blogging; Common platform; Internet needs; NAtural language processing; Public internet; Speech detection; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Ghimire A., Thapa S., Jha A.K., Adhikari S., Kumar A., Accelerating business growth with big data and artificial intelligence, 2020 Fourth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 441-448, (2020); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Cyber hate speech on twitter: An application of machine classification and statistical modeling for policy and decision making, Policy & Internet, 7, 2, pp. 223-242, (2015); Del Vigna F., Cimino A., Dell'Orletta F., Petrocchi M., Tesconi M., Hate me, hate me not: Hate speech detection on facebook, Proceedings of the First Italian Conference on Cybersecurity (ITASEC17), pp. 86-95, (2017); Banks J., Regulating hate speech online, International Review of Law, Computers & Technology, 24, 3, pp. 233-239, (2010); The Number of Tweets per Day in, (2020); Adhikari S., Thapa S., Singh P., Huo A., Bharathy G., Prasad M., A comparative study of machine learning and nlp techniques for uses of stop words by patients in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 1-8, (2021); Thapa S., Adhikari S., Ghimire A., Aditya A., Feature selection based twin-support vector machine for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, 2020 IEEE 8th R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC), (2020); Malmasi S., Zampieri M., Detecting Hate Speech in Social Media, (2017); Cao R., Lee R.K.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 11-20, (2020); Park J.H., Fung P., One-step and Two-step Classification for Abusive Language Detection on Twitter, (2017); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 11, 1, (2017); Founta A., Et al., Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of twitter abusive behavior, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 12, 1, (2018); Gamback B., Sikdar U.K., Using convolutional neural networks to classify hate-speech, Proceedings of the First Workshop on Abusive Language Online, pp. 85-90, (2017); De Gibert O., Perez N., Garcia-Pablos A., Cuadros M., Hate Speech Dataset from A White Supremacy Forum, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people. predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter, Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pp. 88-93, (2016); Pitsilis G.K., Ramampiaro H., Langseth H., Effective hate-speech detection in twitter data using recurrent neural networks, Applied Intelligence, 48, 12, pp. 4730-4742, (2018); Bartlett J., Reffin J., Rumball N., Williamson S., Anti-social media, Demos, 2014, pp. 1-51, (2014); Calderon C.A., De La Vega G., Herrero D.B., Topic modeling and characterization of hate speech against immigrants on twitter around the emergence of a far-right party in Spain, Social Sciences, 9, 11, (2020); Warner W., Hirschberg J., Detecting hate speech on the world wide web, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Language in Social Media, pp. 19-26, (2012); Basile V., Et al., Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter, 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63, (2019); Albadi N., Kurdi M., Mishra S., Are they our brothers.

Women constitute 47% of the overall workforce but only 28% of jobs in science and engineering belong to women. This deficit is particularly noticeable in the fields of computer science and engineering as women comprise just 26% of the computer science workforce and hold only 15% of engineering positions. This gender divide begins to emerge at the undergraduate level, as women earn only 19% and 18% of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering and computer science, respectively [2]. It has been hypothesized that these deficits of women in engineering fields have resulted from social marginalization. Specifically, Flam [3] argued that women experience a chilly climate when entering male-dominated fields. In such a climate, women receive direct and indirect messaging that their gender could be an obstacle to success in the work environment, which causes them to feel unwelcome. In such a climate, women often doubt whether they will be fully included, valued, and respected in the field despite their abilities [4], [5]. Further, women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors report notable levels of gender bias and sexual harassment within the context of their work [6]. Among women in STEM majors, experiences of STEM-related gender bias have been found to be related negatively to their career aspiration and motivation to pursue vocational opportunities in STEM [6]. In addition to messages of being unwelcome in the field, women in STEM fields have also been shown to encounter benevolent sexism (e.g., protective paternalism or gender differentiation) from their male peers [7]. This form of sexism has been linked with lower grade point averages (GPAs) in STEM courses [7]. These findings highlight the impact the academic climate can have on underrepresented students pursuing careers in STEM fields. Because GPA represents a primary achievement measure that carries important implications for one's academic trajectory, efforts to enhance representation of women and people of color in STEM fields can be evaluated using GPA. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","","Engineering education; Personnel; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Computer engineering; Computer science and engineerings; Engineering and computer science; Engineering position; Grade point average; Science and engineering; Underrepresented students; Women in engineering; Professional aspects","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (EEC-1565130)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award EEC-1565130.

Through retrospective interviews with 40 STEM graduates working professionally for five or more years in STEM, the data revealed that (1) experiences of racism and sexism among women of color affected their ability to build strong relationships with professors and gain access to career-related opportunities through those con-nections; (2) white females experienced sexism from faculty, but their white privilege buffered the negative effects associated with their gender and allowed them to form closer connections with fac-ulty; (3) being exposed to diverse faculty facilitated conversations between professors and students of color, as well as faculty and female students, about their career pathways in STEM; and (4) the negative influence of race/ethnicity and gender on student–faculty relationships was alleviated, but not eliminated, through research engagement, which in turn expanded students’ access to professional opportunities. Grounded on these findings, we provide recommendations for research and practice. © 2020 by Begell House, Inc.","Career outcomes; Postgraduation; Social capital; Social ties; STEM; Students of color; Student–faculty interactions; Women","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1660914)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1660914.","Amelink C.

Despite decades of concerted effort to broaden participation in engineering, representation continues to lack. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide education researchers and practitioners with a clear understanding of barriers to the participation of Black American children in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our interest is driven by the role that precollege STEM experiences play in children's likelihood of becoming potential engineering students. Scope/Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of 41 articles focused on Black children in precollege STEM contexts. Each article underwent individual review to gain deeper insight into key contextual factors that enable and constrain these potential engineers. Results: We situate our research findings in Perna's college choice model to highlight the key factors that may influence one's career and college decisions. The contextual factors are associated with the (1) social, economic, and policy context (e.g., racism, sexism, and classism); (2) STEM educational and community context (i.e., social perceptions and access); and (3) the local support context (i.e., teachers and family). Conclusions: Our results represent the early workings of a “glass ceiling” above the heads of potential engineering students. The underrepresentation of Black Americans who thrive in engineering is a byproduct of the lack of accessibility to quality and advanced learning experiences that too often plague K–12 schools and communities that serve high populations of Black Americans. Such findings have implications for research and practice. © 2021 The Authors.

However, social media platforms have been used maliciously and subsequently lead to cyberbullying. Detecting cyberbullying manually is almost impossible due to massive data generated by social media users daily. Several strategies including opinion mining methods, machine learning techniques and deleting fake profiles have been utilized to deal with cyberbullying on social media platforms. However, due to the nature and structure of datasets as well as the language used, it is tremendously becoming difficult to detect cyberbullying. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive review of deep learning models applied to detect cyberbullying on various social media platforms. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, recurrent neural networks and bidirectional gated recurrent unit are predominantly used to detect different forms of cyberbullying such as hate speech, harassment, sexism, bullying among others. The study also revealed that cyberbullying causes psychological effects such as stress, anxiety, worthlessness, depression, reduced self-esteem, suicidal ideation and psychological distress, frustration, sleep-related issues and psychosis. This study also revealed that the majority of deep learning-based cyberbullying detection models utilized Twitter textual dataset. In the future, there is a need to utilize multimedia data such as images, audio and videos from various social media platforms to effectively develop cyberbullying detection models that can automatically detect all forms of bullying. This can tremendously assist law enforcement agencies to curb the menace of cyberbullying on various social media platforms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cyberbullying; Deep learning; Detection; Social media networks","","","","","","","","Beale A.V., Hall K.R., Cyberbullying: What School Administrators (and Parents) Can Do, Clear.

To test the students’ perception of emotional stereotypes in both sexes, we calculated their score in ambivalent sexism for a sample of 77 subjects of both sexes. The presence of sexism was detected in the sample; according to the formulated scale, it appears to be present in low levels. Hostile sexism prevails over benevolent sexism in both sexes. It has been found that in hostile sexism the differences are statistically significant between both sexes. Hostile sexism with respect to benevolent sexism is higher in boys than in girls, while benevolent sexism is equally low in girls. These findings encourage working on this topic in schools in a more specific manner, and thus promote more comprehensive education for students. © 2019 © Common Ground Research Networks, Alberto Nolasco Hernández, Raúl Carretero Bermejo, Laura Gracia Sánchez, All Rights Reserved.","Education; Emotional Intelligence; Emotional Stereotype; Gender; Sexism","","","","","","","","Aquino Alberto, Differences of Gender and Age in the Emotional Intelligence of a Group of Internet Users, (2003); Ayres Melanie M., Friedman Carly K., Leaper Campbell, Individual and Situational Factors Related to Young Women's Likelihood of Confronting Sexism in Their Everyday Lives, Sex Roles, 61, 7–8, pp. 449-460, (2009); Baron-Cohen Simon, The Essential Difference: The Male and Female Brain, Phi Kappa Phi Forum 2005, 85, pp. 22-26, (2005); Beal Carole, Boys and Girls: The Development of Gender Roles, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 29, 9, pp. 1147-1158, (1994); Brackett Marc, Warner Rebecca, Bosco Jennifer, Emotional Intelligence and Relationship Quality among Couples, Personal Relationships, 12, 2, pp. 197-212, (2005); Brackett Marc, Rivers Susan, Shiffman Sara, Lerner Nicole, Salovey Peter, Relating Emotional Abilities to Social Functioning: A Comparison of Self-Report and Performance Measures of Emotional Intelligence, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91, 4, pp. 780-795, (2006); Bridges Judith S., Pink or Blue: Gender-Stereotypic Perceptions of Infants as Conveyed by Birth Congratulations Cards, Psychology of Women Quarterly, 17, 2, pp. 193-205, (1993); Carretero Bermejo Raul, Sexo, sexismo y acoso escolar entre iguales” [Sex, Sexism and Bullying among Equals, Complutense Magazine of Education, 22, 1, pp. 27-43, (2011); Emotional Intelligence and Sexism.

Recently, the NAE hosted their annual meeting and included a keynote speaker, Dr. John Slaughter, who has committed his life's work to dismantling racism specifically in engineering education. He called the organization and members to recognize the challenges that systemic racism poses for the engineering field and to take action in changing the way our students are educated. Dr. Slaughter pointed out that without an inclusive engineering workforce, we are missing viable and important solutions to engineering problems. As engineering leadership educators, our obligation to our students extends beyond transmission of technical knowledge. We have a responsibility to infuse our curriculum with knowledge of systemic racism, how bias can impact our solutions, and how engineers can lead and create teams that foster belonging and inclusivity. We must help engineering leadership students develop a growth mindset and discover the sophistication of mind to celebrate diversity, equity, and inclusion in their daily lives, school, and workplace. This requires us to consider inclusive leadership as a foundational approach to engineering leadership development. Inclusive leadership has been shown to positively impact team performance, decision-making, collaboration, innovation, and motivation. Inclusive leaders celebrate differences and recognize and challenge attacks on DEI. As engineering leadership educators, we must lead by example, model inclusive leadership behavior, and have courage to infuse these concepts into our curriculum. This paper assembles the collective thoughts, perspectives, insights, and experiences of a distinguished panel of educators and scholars on embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom and teaching practices. The panel brings together people from multiple universities, different stages of their career, with interests in various areas related to DEI. It includes John Slaughter who has devoted his life to combatting racism, to scholars whose research is dedicated to teaching about DEI and creating a work environment that values DEI, and educators who have found creative ways to incorporate DEI in their instruction of engineering courses. The panel and this paper will have recommendations on why it is important to welcome DEI in our workplace and in our classrooms, how to embrace DEI in designing and delivering our courses and teaching strategies to celebrate and support DEI as we prepare students for the workforce. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","","Behavioral research; Curricula; Decision making; Education computing; Engineering education; Teaching; Classroom practices; Collaboration innovations; Daily lives; Decisions makings; Engineering fields; Engineering leadership; Engineering problems; Leadership behaviors; Leadership development; Team performance; Students","","","","","","","Mcgee E.

Moreover, ease of access to social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. has led to an exponential increase in the mistreatment of people in the form of hateful messages, bullying, sexism, racism, aggressive content, harassment, toxic comment etc. Thus there is an extensive need to identify, control and reduce the bullying contents spread over social media sites, which has motivated us to conduct this research to automate the detection process of offensive language or cyberbullying. Our main aim is to build single and double ensemble-based voting model to classify the contents into two groups: 'offensive' or 'non-offensive'. For this purpose, we have chosen four machine learning classifiers and three ensemble models with two different feature extraction techniques combined with various n-gram analysis on a dataset extracted from Twitter. In our work, Logistic Regression and Bagging ensemble model classifier have performed individually best in detecting cyberbullying which has been outperformed by our proposed SLE and DLE voting classifiers. Our proposed SLE and DLE models yield the best performance of 96% when TF-IDF (Unigram) feature extraction is applied with K-Fold cross-validation. © 2021 IEEE.","Cyberbullying; Machine Learning Classifiers; Offensive Language; Text Classification; Twitter","Cellular radio systems; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Extraction; Feature extraction; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Detection process; Exponential increase; Feature extraction techniques; K fold cross validations; Machine learning approaches; Offensive languages; Social media platforms; Voting classifiers; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Schmidt A., Wiegand M., A Survey on Hate Speech Detection Using Natural Language Processing, pp. 1-10, (2017); Niu G., He J., Lin S., Sun X., Longobardi C., Cyberbullying victimization and adolescent depression: The mediating role of psychological security and the moderating role of growth mindset, Int.

Consequently, hate speech is used more and more, to the point where it has become a serious problem invading these open spaces. Hate speech refers to the use of aggressive, violent or offensive language, targeting a specific group of people sharing a common property, whether this property is their gender (i.e., sexism), their ethnic group or race (i.e., racism) or their believes and religion. While most of the online social networks and microblogging websites forbid the use of hate speech, the size of these networks and websites makes it almost impossible to control all of their content. Therefore, arises the necessity to detect such speech automatically and filter any content that presents hateful language or language inciting to hatred. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect hate expressions on Twitter. Our approach is based on unigrams and patterns that are automatically collected from the training set. These patterns and unigrams are later used, among others, as features to train a machine learning algorithm. Our experiments on a test set composed of 2010 tweets show that our approach reaches an accuracy equal to 87.4% on detecting whether a tweet is offensive or not (binary classification), and an accuracy equal to 78.4% on detecting whether a tweet is hateful, offensive, or clean (ternary classification). © 2018 IEEE.","hate speech; machine learning; sentiment analysis; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Speech; Websites; Binary classification; Common property; Offensive languages; On-line social networks; Sentiment analysis; Speech detection; Training sets; Twitter; Speech recognition","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (15H04010)","","King R.D., Sutton G.M., High times for hate crimes: Explaining the temporal clustering of hate-motivated offending, Criminology, 51, 4, pp. 871-894, (2013); Breckheimer J.P., A haven for hate: The foreign and domestic implications of protecting Internet hate speech under the first amendment, South California Law Rev., 75, 6, (2002); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Cyber hate speech on twitter: An application of machine classification and statistical modeling for policy and decision making, Policy Internet, 7, 2, pp. 223-242, (2015); Razavi A.H., Inkpen D., Uritsky S., Matwin S., Offensive language detection using multi-level classification, Advances in Artificial Intelligence, 6085, pp. 16-27, (2010); Warner W., Hirschberg J., Detecting hate speech on the world wide Web, Proc. 2nd Workshop Lang.

Previous studies have primarily focused on examining why the number of women enrolled in engineering colleges remains persistently low. In doing so, while we have gained btter understanding of the challenges and barriers that women encountered and factors that contribute to such negative experiences, it also, as some scholars have pointed out, has cast a deficit frame on such matters. In this study, we take on a positive stand where we focus on women undergraduate students who not only “stay” but also succeed in engineering programs (that is, our definition of thriving) as a way to locate the personal and institutional factors that facilitate such positive outcomes. Our initial pilot study involved two female engineering undergraduate students at an R1 university. Each student was interviewed three times. While each of the interviews in the sequence had a slightly different focus, the overall goal was to understand the women's autobiographic and educational experiences leading to their paths to engineering and participation in the engineering project teams. The inductive thematic analysis revealed several primary findings which subsequently played a major role in developing a codebook for the current study. Building upon what is learned from the pilot study, the current study uses a layered multi-case study design involving three institutions: a public/private Ivy League and statutory land-grand research university in the Northeast, a public land-grant research university in the Midwest, and a public land-grant research university in the Southwest which is also designated as MSI/HSI. In addition to the interview method, data collection also contains documents and artifacts. For this paper, we zone in onto the data collected in the first interviews, known as the “life history” where we mainly learn about the women undergraduate participants' personal-familial contexts that contribute to their entry to majoring in engineering as identified by the women themselves. Preliminary findings indicate that: (1) our participants tend to have supportive families; (2) while all experienced gender biases, not everyone has formed a critical consciousness of sexism; and (3) being able to actually engage by “doing” something and creating a product is key to the women's finding joy in engineering and associating themself with the field/profession. It is important to note that the second interviews, which focus on the educational journey of the participants in relation to engineering identity development and project team experiences, are underway. The ultimate goal for the study is to develop a theoretical framework speaking to a multifaceted model of forces (micro as autobiographic, macro as institutional, and in-between or middle-level as team-based) in shaping women's entry and advance in engineering programs. This framework will recognize the variations in institutional type, resource availability, and structural and cultural characteristics and traditions in teams. It will also use such differences to show possibilities of more versatile ways for diversifying pathways for women and other minoritized groups to thrive in engineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.","","Engineering education; Professional aspects; 'current; Engineering colleges; Engineering education research; Engineering program; Pilot studies; Project team; Public lands; Research universities; Undergraduate students; Women in engineering; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2015688, 2015741, 2015909, 2100560); University of Nebraska-Lincoln, UNL, (1950597)","This work was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF # 2100560, 2015688, 2015741, 2015909).

Authorship attribution is a forensics tool that can help fight against these misconducts when applied to the small texts posted on these platforms. In this work, we exploit the recent developments in language models to tackle the problem of authorship attribution of small messages. Training one model per suspect, we devise a generative approach and compare it against a state-of-the-art discriminative method. Our results show that generative and discriminative features are complementary and can be leveraged to improve the results of current methods. Finally, we propose a strategy to use discriminative and generative models jointly and draw future research paths.  © 2022 IEEE.","Authorship Attribution; Deep Learning; Language Models; Multimedia Forensics; Social Media","Deep learning; Digital forensics; Social networking (online); Authorship attribution; Deep learning; Discriminative methods; Forensic tools; Language model; Large-scales; Multimedia forensics; Social media; Social media platforms; State of the art; Computational linguistics","","","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2017/12646-3, 2018/10204-6, 2019/21030-1)","Google® Latin America Research Awards (LARA) and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) DéjàVu #2017/12646-3, #2018/10204-6, and #2019/21030-1 funded this work. 1https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/","Chen A., The agency, (2015); Davey-Attlee F., Soares I., The fake news machine. inside a town gearing up for, (2020); Kirkpatrick D.D., Who is behind qanon? linguistic detectives find fingerprints, (2022); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 30, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Schuster M., Nakajima K., Japanese and korean voice search, Proc. of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

Ideally, a chatbot is void of racism, sexism, or any other offensive speech, however several well-known public instances indicate otherwise (e.g., Microsoft Taybot). In this paper, we explore the mechanisms of how open source conversational chatbots can learn bias, and we investigate potential solutions to mitigate this learned bias. To this end, we developed the Chatbot Bias Assessment Framework to measure bias in conversational chatbots, and then we devised an approach based on counter-stereotypic imagining to reduce this bias. This approach is non-intrusive to the chatbot, since it does not require altering any AI code or deleting any data from the original training dataset.  © 2022 IEEE.","AI; chatbot; ethics; NLP","Chatbots; Humaninteraction; Learn+; MicroSoft; Non-intrusive; Open-source; Training dataset","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (281301)","","Vincent J., Twitter taught Microsoft's AI Chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day, (2016); Han X., Et al., Designing Efective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging, ACM CHI Virtual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2021); Srivastava B., Et al., Personalized Chatbot Trustworthiness Ratings, IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society, 4, (2020); Zhong S., Et al., How To Evaluate Single-Round Dialogues Like Humans: An Information-Oriented Metric, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 28, (2020); Srivastava B., Et al., Rating AI systems for bias to promote trustable applications, IBM Journal of Research and Development, 63, 4-5, (2019); Hanu L., Et al., How AI is Learning to Identify Toxic Online Content, Scientific American Online, (2021); Chatterbot, Github; Shekhar A., Chatbot Using Deep Learning in Python, CodeSpeedy; Chai Y., Et al., How to Keep an Online Learning Chatbot from Being Corrupted, IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, (2020); Treml F., How to Test a Chatbot - Part 1: Why is it so Hard?, Chatbot Magazine, (2018); Fauzia M., Fact Check"" Facebook didn't pull the plug on two chatbots because they created a language, USA Today, (2021); McKay T., No, Facebook Did Not Panic and Shut Down an AI Program That Was Getting Dangerously Smart; Kempf A., If We Are Going to Talk About Implicit Race Bias, We Need to Talk About Structural Racism: Moving Beyond Ubiquity and Inevitability in Teaching and Learning About Race, Taboo: The Journal of Culture and Education, 19, 2, (2020); Khan A., Why is Education Industry opting for AI Chatbots?

Our LLC model at the University of Denver calls for students to live together on the same dorm floor, take a two-credit course together, and various co-curricular activities. For the course, students read articles and watch videos curated by the instructors. Students then engage in short writing exercises, small group discussions, and then full class presentations. Other active learning models such as design exercises are being utilized. Topics covered during the two quarters include racism/anti-racism, sexism/anti-sexism, social media, AI, robotics in policy, robotics in the military, privacy, genetic engineering, biomechanical augmentation, ethics, diversity in engineering and computer science, and infusing JEDI into engineering/computer science education. Students are exploring how recent and new technology is codifying systemic oppression based on race and gender. We have been using ethical models to explore decision making of hypothetical and real products/systems. Our curriculum is a work in progress; hence we are assessing the course on an on-going basis. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.","","Decision making; Education computing; Engineering education; Ethical technology; Robotics; Active Learning; Co-curricular activities; Community model; Engineering and computer science; Learning community; Learning models; Living communities; Small group discussions; Social media; University of Denver; Students","","","","","","","Atadero R.

Existing research on technology-related abuse has primarily focused on describing the dynamics of abuse and developing solutions for this problem; we extend this literature by focusing on the security practices of advocates working “on the ground”, i.e. in domestic violence shelters and other support services. We present findings from 26 semi-structured interviews and a data walkthrough workshop in which advocates described how they support survivors. We identified a variety of intertwined emotional and technical support practices, including establishing trust, safety planning, empowerment, demystification, supporting evidence collection and making referrals. By building relationships with other services and stakeholders, advocates also develop networks of care throughout society to create more supportive environments for survivors. Using critical and feminist theories, we see advocates as sources of crucial technical expertise to reduce this kind of violence in the future. Security and privacy researchers can build on and develop these networks of care by employing participatory methods and expanding threat modelling to account for interpersonal harms like coercive control and structural forms of discrimination such as misogyny and racism. © USENIX Security Symposium, Security 2022.All rights reserved.","","Developing solutions; Digital security; Domestic violence; Emotional supports; Safety planning; Security Practice; Semi structured interviews; Support services; Technical support; Walkthroughs; Security systems","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R045178/1)","Many thanks to our participants, without whose ideas and dedication this work would not be possible.

This growth influenced the creation of new federal policies (e.g., the Bayh-Dole Act) and federal government agencies' programming (e.g., SBIR, STTR and I-Corps) that sparked innovation to help drive the U.S. economy forward. Although there has been a significant push for entrepreneurship and innovation, there is still a lack of representation of racially minoritized populations (i.e., African Americans or Black people, Hispanics/Latinx, and Native Americans/Alaskan Natives) in entrepreneurship, innovation, and science technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. In 2012, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy found that racially minoritized business owners accounted for only 22.9% of all U.S. business owners. This representation is even lower within STEM entrepreneurship (i.e., individuals in STEM disciplines who practice entrepreneurship or innovation as business owners or by starting a new venture). Previous research has focused on understanding and improving racial disparities and diversity gaps within STEM and within entrepreneurship that affect women, people of color, and low-income populations. Here, we present a literature review that seeks to describe the current state of knowledge in examining the experiences of racially minoritized populations in STEM entrepreneurship and how they are studied with hopes to identify potential opportunities for research in the future and the use of intersectionality. During the 1990s, the term “intersectionality” emerged from critical legal scholarship to examine how systems of power (e.g., racism, sexism, classism, ableism) intersect to affect the social and political implications of individuals' lived experiences. Since then, intersectionality has become a critical approach to better understand and address the experiences and challenges of racially minoritized populations. The goal of this review is to summarize how the experiences of racially minoritized individuals in STEM entrepreneurship are studied and provide an overview of the frameworks used and study outcomes. First, we conducted a literature review search using Scopus and ProQuest to include literature on underrepresented populations' experiences in STEM entrepreneurship using a combination of the STEM, entrepreneurship, diversity, and experience search strings. Next, we explored the 772 results. We then applied all inclusion and exclusion criteria to this literature review search and removed all duplicates. This resulted in eight remaining articles that studied the experiences of racially minoritized populations in STEM entrepreneurship. However, none of these articles referenced intersectionality or used intersectionality as a framework to examine the experiences of racially minoritized populations. This resulted in many of the research findings' being limited and unable to address the unique barriers that racially minoritized populations confront in STEM entrepreneurship. Thus, we propose the use of Intersectionality Theory as a lens for examining STEM entrepreneurship will help to better understand the complex intersecting identities that shape social inequality and the experiences of marginalized groups in STEM entrepreneurship. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","Entrepreneurship; Intersectionality; Racially minoritized groups; STEM","Bayh-Dole Act; Business owners; Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship education; Federal policies; Intersectionality; Literature reviews; Racially minoritized group; Science technologies; Science technology, engineering, and math; Engineering education","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF","Pathways to Innovation, an NSF funded program, seeks to aid and fund institutions in incorporating innovation and entrepreneurship into university courses [20].

However, government, commercial and cultural pressure on amateur radio to justify its existence forced the predominantly male hobby to police its borders against female incursions. Countering a domestic containment ideology that positioned male hams as wage-earning husbands and national defenders inhabiting the public sphere, and female hams as housewives confined within the private sphere, women promoted a cosmopolitan, technocratic vision of radio's capacity to foster a progressive society unencumbered by outmoded gender expectations. Women's QSL cards (postcards exchanged to confirm on-air communication) map an international social network of likeminded women at a moment in which they were ignored and maligned. By designing their own cards, women recuperated sexist visual tropes to define their own gender identities and behaviours. They constituted physical proof of the technical expertise of female amateurs and documented their participation in radio organizations and public-minded activities. Finally, the cards facilitated female solidarity critical to rooting out sexism in the Cold War-era ham community. Examining the strategies of female hams for contesting institutionalized sexism helps us understand how women create community and foster understanding in maledominated fields. © 2017 Intellect Ltd Article.

In India, men and women are witnessing gender discrimination for generations, affecting the lives of both genders. This review paper focuses on past studies of gender role portrayal in Indian advertisement to comprehend the contemporary situation of gender representation. Around thirty articles have been analyzed between the years 2000 and 2020. The article and conference papers that are published in the English language have been considered for the undertaken study. Based upon the study, the magazine print advertisement shows that gender stereotype still exists in Indian advertisements. The findings of the study reveal that stereotype portrayal of gender is used in different product categories. Moreover, sexism and degrading portrayal of women are used to sell product in Indian advertisement. Some researchers also observed a slight improvement in women representation in Indian advertisements. Based upon this study, a few gap areas are identified in the study of gender role portrayal in Indian advertisements. The study also provides a platform to fill those lacunas for future researchers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cognative ergonomics; Gender-role portrayal; Human factor; Indian advertisements; Stereotypes","","","","","","","","Wright J.S., Warner D.S., Advertising: With a foreword by Norman H.

Experiences of sexism, gender stereotyping, and delegitimization typify the chilly climate characteristic of engineering fields. Nonetheless, women continue to demonstrate considerable resolve to endure in the field. The present study examined the resilient coping strategies employed by 15 women in engineering. Results revealed that women still encountered gendered and stereotyped experiences as well as broader environmental obstacles that perpetuate the unwelcoming engineering climate. Despite these challenges, women employed a myriad of resilient coping strategies to create their success. These included perseverance, asserting one’s legitimacy, cultivating support and belongingness, recognition of strengths, and meaningful impact as a reason to thrive. Implications and future research directions are discussed. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc.","Engineering; Resilience; STEM; Women","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: tioners and educators can play a salient role in efforts to promote their retention. For example, STEM department chairs and employers could offer programs and workshops designed to counter internalized messages of self-doubt and increase women’s confidence in both their transferrable and discipline-specific skills. Career counseling and advising services could also include workshops and groups that cultivate support and strength-focused skill building (e.g., assertiveness, recognition of strengths, etc.) in order to augment students’ coping strategies. In addition to the above, practitioners can provide empirically validated resources that can aid in building students’ resilience coping strategies. One such practical resource is CareerWISE, an evidence-based online resilience training program created by Dr. Bianca Bernstein and colleagues and funded by the National Science Foundation (Bernstein, 2011; Bekki et al., 2013).; Funding text 2: Our findings also offer evidence to indicate that engineering environs continue to present a myriad of barriers to women’s persistence. Here, educators, employers, and administrators can play a salient role in addressing the pervasive and systemic issues within engineering departments and workplaces. Such an endeavor will require the involvement of all faculty and employees, particularly men. Fundamental to such endeavors is the cultivation of a climate that listens and acts in cases of bias and discrimination instead of silencing and ostracizing those who file reports. To create such a climate, ongoing programs that promote diversity and inclusivity are paramount. One program shown to be effective in facilitating increased understanding and recognition of both explicit and implicit gendered discrimination among male faculty is the Advocates and Allies initiative, a program funded by the National Science Foundation which has now been implemented in over eight universities. The promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion values needs to move beyond a one-and-done approach but instead needs to be woven into the very fabric of the organization (e.g., hiring committees, classrooms, meetings, etc.).","Barto H., Lambert S., Brott P., Career adaptability, resiliency and perceived obstacles to career development of adolescent mothers, The Professional Counselor, 5, 1, pp. 53-66, (2015); Bekki J.

This paper focused on hate speech racism and sexism and built a refined classifier that detects racist and sexist comments from the tweets. Investigating accessible data from Internet-based existence may produce interesting findings and bits of information about virtually every object, organization, or individual inside the universe of general feelings. Opinion mining is the statistical action behavior of suppositions, notions, and subjectivity of content from a corpus that integrates natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to classify a range of emotions. As such, sentiment analysis remains a widely researched and ever-evolving topic in the field of NLP. XGBoost with word2vec gave us the most promising results, so we refined it further by fine-tuning.

While concerns around the impact of anonymity, particularly for women, people of color and LGBTQ folks, is legitimate, this paper argues that a flat rejection of digital anonymity is problematic, foreclosing certain forms of queer and feminist praxis. To make this case, I turn to the platform politics of Craigslist. Using Craigslist as a case study, I discuss the persistent stigma attached to online anonymity, before addressing specific tactics of online anonymity associated with queer and feminist values of privacy and mutual aid. Drawing on accounts of Craigslist users who saw anonymity as a protective form of control over their personal information, I outline ways in which anonymity is not solely an enabler for misogyny and homophobia, and can instead (or rather, also) be a subversive tool for self-expression and intimacy. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

While some aspects of teaming with engineering students are well understood and implemented into instructional tools, tools for handling student teams dealing with implicit and explicit racism, sexism, and homophobia are infrequent. Instructors of large undergraduate courses need tools to help make team-level marginalization visible at the classroom level to interrupt discriminatory or marginalizing behavior amongst teammates, and to model allyship so teammates learn how to interrupt others' marginalizing behavior when instructors are not around. This paper describes the broader project, and describes some early results, focused on an algorithm that can help identify teams engaging in marginalizing behaviors against minoritized students, whether minoritized by race, gender, nationality, LGBTQ identity, or other categorization schemes. We describe how the algorithm is proving useful to identify student teams to focus on for analysis to answer some of our research questions focused on how engineering undergraduate teams marginalize minoritized members, and illustrate one such analysis.

Often, diversity and inclusion issues, along with other societal challenges, are perceived as unrelated to engineering. Conversely, engineering as currently practiced and taught is embedded in dominant culture norms that are frequently invisible to the majority of the students and faculty. One strategy to shift this erroneous ""neutral""perspective is to integrate diversity and inclusion into engineering curricula. Using inclusive professional identities as a theoretical lens, we developed an activity that incorporates diversity and inclusion into the technical content of Engineering Mechanics: Statics. Using thematic analysis, we found that students' responses to prompts about their identities, engineering as a profession, and their perceived learning revealed two primary themes: teamwork and engineering/math-related skills/experiences. Although diversity and inclusion were included in responses, students did not connect diversity and inclusion to engineering as a profession. Therefore, students might need more support to make this connection. Although singular activities cannot explicitly overcome racism, sexism, or other deeply entrenched biases in our society, the activity type we describe might help students develop a more holistic perspective of engineering and understand the importance of addressing biases in their future engineering careers.  © 2021 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.","Civil engineering education; Diversity; Equity; Inclusive professional identities; Thematic analysis","Engineering education; Students; Engineering careers; Engineering curriculum; Engineering mechanics; Holistic perspectives; Perceived learning; Professional identity; Technical content; Thematic analysis; Professional aspects","","","","","","","ASEE Best Diversity Paper Past Winners, (2019); Atadero R.A., Paguyo C.H., Rambo-Hernandez K.E., Henderson H.L., Building inclusive engineering identities: Implications for changing engineering culture, Eur.

Most such studies are addressing the perception of sexist content in games and the attitude in gaming communities. This article analyses the digital game Behind Every Great One, which portraits benevolent sexism, i.e. sexism that may appear positive but that has a damaging effect. What is unique with this game is that it is played from the victim's perspective, a housewife. The article presents an inductive analysis of the game using a triangulation of three different methods: a textual analysis, a player study, and an interview with the developer. The result shows that the game manages to convey benevolent sexism to players and evoke empathy for the victim. This is achieved through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and visual and musical aesthetics. For example, the physical space available for the protagonist is constantly shrinking and crying is used as a powerful mechanics in the game. The player needs to find an empty space for the protagonist to cry and this provides insight into her emotional state. Through the game, the developer reflects upon his own behaviour towards women and the consequences it might have had for them. In particular how his, and other men's, self-absorption forces their female partners into an undesirable social role, in which their needs are constantly neglected. The combination of a meaningful gameplay and the use of game mechanics to convey a message lead us to suggest that the gameplay can be characterized as a persuasive meaningful play. The game has a potential to be used in educational environments as a starting point for discussions regarding gender roles and benevolent sexism. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

Female RMSP participants exhibited substantially higher retention rates and grade point averages relative to other female engineering students at CSU. To better understand the impact of the RMSP, and its effectiveness among female engineering students, researchers focused on whether, and how, experiences and perceptions differ between male and female students in engineering programs. That is, how do male and female students differ, if at all, in their subjective perception of life as an engineering major at CSU? A survey was developed measuring resilience, self-efficacy, motivation, social support, academic support, and perceived sexism. Data was obtained from 144 first-year engineering students at CSU. Results indicated that social support from extracurricular activities is particularly important among female students. This points to an increasing need for programs like the RMSP to create social networks among students and faculty, link students to the broader impacts of their work, and ultimately improve the undergraduate experience of under-represented groups in STEM programs. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.

Isolation limits women of color’s ability to form supportive networks to deal with the stressors that result from bias and discrimination. Isolation can also prevent women of color from creating support networks that may buffer against stressors. We used a grounded approach to explore the extent to which being the “only” woman of color, versus one of a few, mediates the experiences of incivility, harassment, and broader discriminatory practices experienced by science faculty across rank. We ran six focus groups with a total of 15 women of color science faculty at a research-intensive Midwestern university to explore these themes. Our research supports previous findings that women of color of all ranks experience negative workplace experiences such as incivility and harassment, and the exclusion of women of color occurs at both institutional and interpersonal levels. Our findings yielded new insights into how experiences of social isolation lead to the internalization of gaslighting messages that deny or minimize the occurrence of incivility and harassment. We also found that social support helps women to contextualize their experiences, allowing them to recognize and identify it within the broader cultural patterns of sexism and racism. Social exclusion and isolation intensify the negative psychological impact of negative workplace experiences, whereas social support validates women of color’s negative experiences and helps externalize these events. Therefore, we suggest that the level of isolation experienced by women of color faculty can mediate the relationship between negative experiences in academic science and personal and professional outcomes such as mental health and productivity. We use this model of psychological impacts of incivility and harassment to suggest future areas of research regarding women of color in STEM. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.","Harassment; Incivilities; Social support; STEM; Women of color","","","","","","Illinois Leadership Center; Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign","This research was funded by the Illinois Leadership Center Faculty Fellowship, and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Some are successful, some are not. Many of them take time to share a small piece of themselves with a protégé, to encourage others. Some have been doing it for a long time, some just started. What they all have in common, however, is that they are connecting with protégés about careers in a field that is dominated by men, where most have learned how to get along in a world where they are members of an out-group during the day, and expected to morph into in-group (including family, friends, etc.) by night [35]. And, yes, sometimes it is hard to resist the pull of benevolent sexism [67]. For that reason alone, this research is important for women who work with mostly men and mentor mostly females in their field. Once the reader understands the pervasiveness of implicit attitudes that are instilled through stereotypes and the duality of heterosexual attraction with paternalism or differentiation, it becomes clearer why mentors' should baseline their own gender bias to better understand how that may impact the work they do as mentors. It is also important for leaders to understand the distribution of gender bias in their organizations so that they can prepare and administer appropriate workforce or institutional training. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","","Engineering education; Professional aspects; Engineering and technology; Gender bias; Implicit attitudes; Pre-college; Role model; Engineering research","","","","","","","Data: Tab9-17_updated_2013_11.Xlsx, (2013); Diversity in the Physician Workforce: Facts & Figures 2010, (2010); Jolliff L., Leadley J., Coakley E., Sloane R.A., Women in U.S. Academic Medicine and Science: Statistics and Benchmarking Report, (2012); First Year and Total J.D.

The rise of the hip-hop culture over the last 50 years has turned into a powerful movement, empowering people from various communities and making their voices heard. However, certain parts of hip-hop and rap music have started being associated with misogyny, substance abuse and violent behavior. This study aims to find a correlation between lyrics of hip-hop and rap songs that glorify such illicit behavior through their lyrics and the actual rate of criminal activity of individuals that are directly or indirectly influenced by hip-hop culture. This research employs NLP concepts to build a model that detects song lyrics that falls into any of the 3 categories—“Misogyny,” “Substance Abuse” and “Violence.” A comparative study is conducted by training multiple models including multinomial naïve Bayes, random forest and LSTM on a manually collected and labeled dataset consisting of rap song lyrics released between 1970 and 2020. The highest performing model (LSTM—87% accuracy) was subsequently used to detect objectionable lyrics in popular rap songs of the decade of 2010–2019. To obtain a correlation of these with the criminal activity of the target population, official data of criminal activity (2010–2019) of citizens aged 0–29 from the largest hip-hop influenced areas in the world are compiled. This dataset is analyzed and to obtain strong evidence of a correlation between objectionable rap song lyrics being promoted through song lyrics and the criminal tendencies of the youth that is primarily affected by it. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Criminal; Hip-Hop; Juvenile crime; LSTM; Misogyny; NLP; Rap; Substance abuse; Violence","","","","","","","","Alridge J Stewart D.P., Introduction: Hip Hop in history: Past, present, and future, J.

It would be useful to discover the hidden relationships between gender harassment and certain beliefs about women as travellers, tourism professionals and sex objects in the field of hospitality. Methodologically, a survey was carried out reaching a sample of ±684 units by means of a convenience sampling procedure. The measuring instruments consisted of a structured questionnaire divided into two kinds of Likert beliefs scales comprising general statements and statements related to tourism. The survey respondent data were also gathered as regards sociodemographic characteristics. This paper presents empirical evidence to identify the causal factors of gender violence by considering general and particular stereotyping in tourism. Firstly, by performing three exploratory factor analyses, three female stereotyping dimensions were labelled in the field of tourism (occupational sexism, ambivalent sexist discrimination, and sex as a commodity), as well as three general prejudices about women (dysfunctional romantic relationships, ethically challenged presumptions, and aesthetical manners conventions) and the gender harassment factor. Secondly, a linear regression analysis was carried out to demonstrate that both general stereotyping related to a broader “life” framework and sectorial prejudices in tourism cause gender harassment. Finally, this research proves that general stereotyping determines sectorial prejudices in the field of tourism. The practical implications could be to enhance gender equality and combat gender harassment by revealing unintentional and unobserved prejudices that occur in a general life setting and in the tourism sphere against women as neglected professionals, under the subtle and ambivalent condition of travellers, and even as objects of consumption. © 2020 by the authors.

However, for whatever reason it is noticeable that verbal misbehaviors, such as hate speech is now propagated through the social networks. One of the most popular social networks is Twitter which has gained widespread in the Arabic region. This research aims to identify and classify Arabic tweets into 5 distinct classes: none, religious, racial, sexism or general hate. A dataset of 11 K tweets was collected and labelled and SVM model was used as a baseline to be compared against 4 deep learning models: LTSM, CNN + LTSM, GRU and CNN + GRU. The results show that all the 4 deep learning models outperform the SVM model in detecting hateful tweets. Although the SVM achieves an overall recall of 74%, the deep learning models have an average recall of 75%. However, adding a layer of CNN to LTSM enhances the overall performance of detection with 72% precision, 75% recall and 73% F1 score. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Arabic NLP; Arabic tweets; Deep learning; Hate speech; Multiclassification; Social networks; Text mining","Deep learning; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Arabic NLP; Arabic tweet; Deep learning; Hate speech; Learning models; Misbehaviour; Multi-classification; Social network; SVM model; Text-mining; Support vector machines","","","","","Deanship of Scientific Research, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, DSR; Department of Sport and Recreation, Government of Western Australia, DSR; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Deanship of scientific research in King Saud University, for funding and supporting this research through the initiative of DSR Graduate Students Research Support (GSR).; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank Deanship of scientific research in King Saud University, for funding and supporting this research through the initiative of DSR Graduate Students Research Support (GSR).

Some programs with a heavy emphasis on developing technical skills or engaging with specific engineering content may not attend specifically to critical theorizations of learning [1]-[3]. As a result, such program designs may not consider youths' prior experiences with engineering or issues of power as consequential to participation [4], [5]. Further, those that seek to develop learner- or youth-centered programs have little research to support them. Although important strides have been made [6]-[9], there is still much to know about how young people have experienced engineering programs from their perspectives and what concerns they may have about participating in them. Further, even less work has explored what makes engineering design work meaningful for youth [10], interrogating what they want to learn and experience in engineering spaces [11], [12]. Centering youths' experiences and voices, particularly those of historically marginalized youth, offers a possible way toward more equitable program design. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the development of more equitable and inclusive engineering programming by centering focal Black and Latina/o/x youths' self-raised experiences in engineering programs as important data for educational design work. The study is drawn from a larger qualitative study seeking to understand how the seven focal youth began to engage in engineering work and discussed their various engineering experiences, within a community program co-designed by the author. I forefront a constant comparative analysis of interview data to examine focal youths' discussions of their various engineering experiences and how they discussed their experiences in relation to themselves. I drew on critical sociocultural theories [13], [14] to help me locate youths' discussions of their experiences as contextual, socially mediated, and operating under larger systems of oppression (e.g., racism, classism, and misogyny). The research questions guiding this particular study are: In what ways do Black and Latina/o/x youth critically talk about their engineering experiences? Specifically, how do they narrate engineering in relation to themselves, if at all? Findings revealed that youth experience and position engineering as a heavy science, technology, and math space, which seemed to create a sense that engineering work was narrow. Further, although varied in nature and degree across youth, all youth discussed an awareness of engineering experiences as potentially being uncomfortable or othering. From actual experiences or theoretical knowledge, youth discussed engineering experiences as places where racism, gender, classism, or other systems of oppression might come to bear on their participation. These findings show the immense amount of work historically marginalized youth may do to understand themselves in current engineering spaces while emphasizing the important challenge of imagining and designing youth-centered engineering spaces that celebrate all aspects of youth and actively counter oppression. Findings imply a need to continue to interrogate youths' prior experiences with engineering and unpack ways systems of oppression operate in all dimensions of youth engineering work. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022","","Behavioral research; Engineering research; Design work; Engineering design; Engineering program; Engineering works; K-12 engineering education; Power; Prior experience; Program design; Technical skills; Young peoples; Engineering education","","","","","","","Johri A., Olds B.

It exposes shared colonial and extractive rationalities and histories of research, higher education, digitalization, and bioeconomy while proposing in the idea of BluesCollarship, a sketch for an alternative culture of worlding and commoning knowledge work and for making care matter in research and higher education. In a discourse analysis and provincialization of research and higher education, a tradition of elitist White-Collaredness in academia and in the social sciences, in particular, is criticized, and an alternative attitude towards the production, transfer, and use of knowledge - BluesCollarship - is proposed. The latter is rooted in a different idea of what ""infrastructure"" is, and in practices of decoloniality. Noting the current political climate of propaganda and populism, the persistence of social inequalities as well as of racism and misogyny, it is proposed that how people give warrant for knowledge claims should be reviewed under different terms. A coherent theme is that there is a genealogical root for current neo-extractive and neo-colonial rationalities in the Athenian idea of oikos, which conflates family, household, and property. In taking a distinctly writerly approach - rather than giving ready-made answers - the book aims at permanently provoking readers at every turn to think further, as well as before-and-beyond what is written, but to do so in thinking together with Others. Thus the book addresses scholars and students from across the social sciences who seek challenges to established ways of thinking in academia without simply replacing one canon for another. This book is for those who think of themselves as knowledge and culture laborers in this age of precarization, who seek to replace the university and cognitive capitalism with a pluriversity and an infrastructure built on knowledge and culture as fundamental values. © 2020 Alexander I.

Since that population change appears in recent 10 years, formerly male-oriented gaming community has confronted gender issues. In this paper, we witness that a strong gender stereotype exists for both genders in Korea by two surveys. In the first survey, subjects show that they have different expectations of opposite gender‟s favorable game style where both genders have exactly same favorite styles. In the second survey, we investigate how members of hostile sexism community groups choose teammates in Overwatch game if they have privilege to select teammates for specific roles. Ilbe and Womad as two far extreme misogyny and misandry groups show hostile sexism in teammate selection. The result implies that hostile sexism and gender stereotype shown in game playing may be induced from other social factors than the amount of the game playing experiences.

Universities have experienced a 37% increase from 2000 to 2010; this includes a rise in underrepresented minority (URM) students from 1976 to 2010. Hispanic student numbers rose from 3 percent to 13 percent, Asian/Pacific Islander students rose from 2 percent to 6 percent, and the percentage of Black students rose from 9 percent to 14 percent. However, the faculty demographic has not kept pace with the increase in URM enrollment. The percentage of URM faculty has remained flat over the last 20 years, hovering at just a little over 5 percent. Researchers, educators, and practitioners believe that in order for students to succeed academically, they need role models and mentors with whom they can identify. Racial and ethnic diversity has both direct and indirect positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of students. The campus climate improves when the diversity of the student population matches that of the faculty. Students from majority groups equally benefit from learning and exchanging ideas in a multicultural environment, offering a wider range of research and a broader representation of alternative perspectives. Therefore, the shift in American demographics over the next ten years changes the question from whether colleges and universities want to support diversity in their faculty distribution to how colleges and universities will accommodate this necessity. Thus, this is a review of the literature on one demographic in engineering academe, the African American woman. African American women are at the intersection of two of the most pervasive prejudices in this country: racism and sexism. This review will unveil some of the unique challenges African American female engineering faculty due to the intersectionality of race and gender. In order, to increase the numbers, the engineering education community must first fully understand the barriers these women face. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","","","","","","","","","Burrelli J.S., Academic institutions of minority faculty with science, engineering, and health doctorates, Science, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, (2011); Promoting Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the Faculty: What Higher Education Unions can Do, (2010); The research agenda for the new discipline of engineering education, Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 259-261, (2006); Anderson-Rowland M.R., A first year engineering student survey to assist recruitment and retention, Frontiers in Education Conference, 1996.

The field continues to suffer from a lack of diversity and struggles to recruit and retain underrepresented students. We argue that structural barriers prevent equitable participation. In this paper, we examine structural barriers-specifically racism and sexism-experienced by underrepresented students in engineering education and highlight useful interventions. We then call for action to improve and diversify educational pathways in engineering. Specifically, we call for and highlight examples of rethinking mindsets for research and instruction.

Today, machine learning techniques play an important role in detecting inappropriate content and help moderate online interaction. Text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods has been extensively studied using deep learning models and transformers which have shown impressive results. Despite this, specific classification tasks on limited datasets still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose an approach based on an Attention-Based Bidirectional LSTM model and a combination of custom features to enhance automatic misogyny identification (AMI) on social media. We present a multi-lingual study of the phenomena by carrying out different classification experiments. Our study focuses on selecting most important features to improve the model for misogyny detection. The proposed model outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Classification tasks; Learning models; Machine learning techniques; Online gaming site; Online interaction; Online moderation; Processing method; Social media; Social media platforms; Text classification; Long short-term memory","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-06233); Mitacs","*This work was enabled in part by support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2018-06233, and the Mitacs Accelerate program.

Design/methodology/approach: A combination of scientometric analysis and meta-analysis was adopted to systematically review 32 relevant studies from 1984 to 2020, to provide a holistic review of research on women’s health and safety in construction aimed to identify the trend of research development. Techniques such as co-authorship, keyword co-occurring and cluster analysis were adopted. Findings: Five main themes summarized by clustering focusing on Workplace Psychological Health, HIV/AIDS and Construction Work, Occupational Health and Safety Injuries, Gender Inclusivity and Sexism in Construction and Gender-specific Health and Safety Analysis. Findings revealed a slow growth in women’s health and safety research with the USA, South Africa, Australia and Japan leading research development. Additionally, the major stressors or hazards faced by women in construction were found to be biological related hazards. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the study are limited, resulting from the use of one abstract and citation database. Practical implications: Findings from the study provide insights to the health and safety challenges of women in construction and identifies of knowledge gaps in the existing literature could provide researchers and industry practitioners with a comprehensive insight into intellectual landscapes, potential research frontiers on technologies for women’s construction health and safety. Originality/value: While numerous studies have focused on the health and safety of workers in the construction industry, research on women’s health and safety is lacking. The study adopted a scientometric and meta-analysis approach to explore the intellectual evolution and reflect the research status on the subject. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction industry; Global research; Health and safety; Meta-analysis; Scientometric; Women","Accident prevention; Biohazards; Biology; Cluster analysis; Construction industry; Health; Health hazards; Industrial hygiene; Design/methodology/approach; Health and safety in constructions; Occupational health and safety; Potential researches; Psychological health; Research development; Scientometric analysis; Women in constructions; Occupational risks","","","","","National Research Foundation, NRF","The financial assistance of the National Research Foundation (NRF) towards this research is hereby acknowledged.

It investigates the struggle of African American women, social realities, Harlem, the defeat of women, African American culture and Triple Oppression. It asks into sexual orientation, segregation, personality and circumstance of ladies in the public arena the situation of African American and self - acknowledgement or self-arousing through the procedure of colonization, African American culture conveyed to America by the slaves. Actually, African Americans are abused and smothered in various angles. This paper is an examination of the manners by which the protagonists of these novels justify the struggles, concealment and suppression they suffered from horrible conditions under which African live. This is an endeavour to investigate from various points of view the mission for the characters Lutie Johnson (The Street) and Abbie Crunch (The Narrows). The protagonist’s involvement in picking up the normal womanhood has various dubious complexities. These fictions particularly explored the black female struggle from a feminist perspective. This paper is an analysis of African American feminism, racial discrimination against blacks, gender disparities, sexism and dominance expressed by both white people and people from their own community. It inquires suppressed life of black women in society in the form of different aspects. The goal of this paper is to break down the sufferings of Africans and their persecuted life. Also, this paper demonstrates how the difficulties looked by the protagonists and how their life ends up outside in the general public and their partition from self-acknowledgement in the general public. © BEIESP.","African American Feminism; Gender and Social Disparities and Psychological Approach; Harlem; Triple Oppression","","","","","","","","Locke A., (1968); Baker H., (1987); Bell B.W., Ann Petrys Demythologizing of American Culture and Afro-American Character.”, Conjuring: Black Women, Fiction, and the Literary Tradition, (1985); Bontemps A.; Ervin H.A., Ann Petry: A Bio-Bibliography and A Comprehensive Compilation of Reviews, Analytical Articles, and Interviews with Petry, (1993); Gates H.L., Ann Petry: Critical Perspectives past and Present, (1998); Gates H.L., The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of Afro- American Literary Criticism, (1988); Huggies N., Renaissance H., (1971); Petry A., The Narrows, (1988); Petry A., The Street Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, (1974); Ellison R., Shadow and Act, Vintage Book.

The goal of the first of five experiments was to assess how witnessing subtle gender bias events influences explicit stereotype activation among people who recognize the events as gender stereotyping as well as those who do not. We utilized video materials that were developed and tested in our previous NSF research that show a group of four engineering students, 2 women and 2 men, working together on an engineering design task. There are two versions of the video: one in which the students engaged in subtle gender bias (bias version), and one in which the students engaged in neutral interactions (control version). Over 400 participants were recruited from a large midwestern research university from computer science and engineering majors in which 30% or fewer majors are women. The survey included assessments of perceptions of gender stereotyping in the video, general stereotype endorsement and STEM stereotype endorsement, and three individual difference measures (gender-based rejection sensitivity, sexism sensitivity and negative emotionality) used as covariates in analyses. We found that participants who saw the bias video reported greater explicit stereotyping when they failed to recognize gender bias in the video. When they did recognize bias, they reported explicit stereotyping at levels similar to those in the control condition. This pattern suggests that exposure to subtle gender bias events may have activated gender stereotypes, but when participants recognized the events as gender bias, they tempered their explicit stereotyping. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.","","Behavioral research; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Computer science and engineerings; Condition; Covariates; Design tasks; Engineering design; Gender bias; Individual Differences; Interaction controls; Research universities; Video material; Students","","","","","National Center for Institutional Diversity; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1954908); Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the contributions of Nadia Vossoughi, Desiree Aleibar, Ariana Munoz Salgado, Koji Takahashi, Nicolas Anderson, Saleen Picard, Callie Cade, Katrina Castillano, and Leo Thiesen.

In two correlational studies, we examined possible antecedents of people’s willingness to participate in the #MeToo campaign by focusing on the role of ambivalent beliefs toward women and men and the perceived effects of the movement. Men (Study 1) and women (Study 2) were asked to answer questions concerning hostile and benevolent beliefs about women and men, respectively, their perception of the beneficial and detrimental effects of #MeToo, and their intentions to participate in the campaign. Study 1 showed that men’s hostile sexism toward women was associated with fewer intentions to actively support the #MeToo campaign and that the reduced beliefs that the movement had beneficial effects mediated this relation. Study 2 revealed that women’s stronger benevolent beliefs about men were associated with decreased perception that the #MeToo campaign had a beneficial impact. In turn, such a perception was related to lower intentions to participate in supporting the campaign. Moreover, women’s hostility toward men explained the intention to join the #MeToo movement through the mediation of the perception that the campaign was beneficial. The findings suggest that to foster participation in a feminist movement that promotes women’s rights, it is necessary to eradicate traditional gender roles and the related ideologies that legitimate men’s dominant position in society. © 2022 by the authors.","ambivalent sexism; collective action; feminism; gender equality; sexual harassment; sustainable development goals","exploration; movement","","","","","","","Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018: Global, Regional and National Prevalence Estimates for Intimate Partner Violence against Women and Global and Regional Prevalence Estimates for Non-Partner Sexual Violence against Women: Executive Summary, (2021); Fernando D., Prasad A., Sex-Based Harassment and Organizational Silencing: How Women Are Led to Reluctant Acquiescence in Academia, Hum.

Given the increasing number of experiences of sexism shared online, categorizing these recollections automatically can support the battle against sexism, since it can promote successful evaluations by gender studies researchers and government representatives engaged in policy making. In this paper, we examine the fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. To the best of our knowledge, we consider substantially more categories of sexism than any related prior work through our 23-class problem formulation. Moreover, we present the first semi-supervised work for the multi-label classification of accounts describing any type(s) of sexism. We devise self-training-based techniques tailor-made for the multi-label nature of the problem to utilize unlabeled samples for augmenting the labeled set. We identify high textual diversity with respect to the existing labeled set as a desirable quality for candidate unlabeled instances and develop methods for incorporating it into our approach. We also explore ways of infusing class imbalance alleviation for multi-label classification into our semi-supervised learning, independently and in conjunction with the method involving diversity. In addition to data augmentation methods, we develop a neural model which combines biLSTM and attention with a domain-adapted BERT model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Further, we formulate a multi-level training approach in which models are sequentially trained using categories of sexism of different levels of granularity. Moreover, we devise a loss function that exploits any label confidence scores associated with the data.

The analyses of variance indicated that benevolent sexism influenced the stereotypical statements about boys' and girls' abilities in the different subject areas, when gender and the specialty was chosen (STEM or non-STEM). The higher the level of benevolent sexism among pre-service teachers, the higher their endorsement of gender stereotypes about students' abilities.

Some situations require intervention by those with authority, some can be confronted directly by individuals, and still others should be ignored. To better understand how students and faculty should respond to sexist comments made by one student to another, we interviewed engineering students, professionals, and faculty, asking them to respond to two different real-life scenarios containing sexist comments. We found that three-fourths of professionals and over one-third of students had experienced inappropriate behaviors that could be labeled as sexist. Furthermore, we found major differences in how students and others perceive particular behaviors. For instance, while close to half of professionals and faculty perceived a sexual joke as ""completely inappropriate,"" most students indicated that they would either ignore the comment or joke back because the speaker was not serious and had no malicious intent. By contrast, students were more inclined to confront a comment that most professionals perceived as a minor irritation and not worth the effort of responding. Our findings also indicate that faculty members were both concerned about students encountering inappropriate sexist behaviors and confused about what to do. We did find evidence, though, that sexual harassment training can help faculty respond more effectively to such situations. The faculty at one campus that mandates harassment training every two years were more likely than others to take action and were much more aware of HR policies and proper professional expectations. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","","","","","","","","","Fouad N.A., Singh R., Stemming the Tide: Why Women Leave Engineering, (2011); Riley D., Engineering and Social Justice, (2008); #StandingwithDNLee [Web Log Post], (2013); Urry M., Male Scientists, Don't Harass Young Female Colleagues, (2014); Schulte B., Study: Uncivil Work Environment Pushing Women Out of the Engineering Field, (2014); Hewlett S.A., Luce C.B., Servon L.J., Sherbin L., Shiller P., Sosnovich E., Sumberg K., The athena factor: Reversing the brain drain in science, engineering, and technology, Harvard Business Review Research Report, (2008); Perez E., Female Engineering Majors Struggle with Confidence Issues, (2011); Frehill L.M., Images of women in engineering textbooks, 1994 WEPAN Coference, pp. 179-184, (1994); Tonso K.L., On the Outskirts of Engineering: Learning Identity, Gender, and Power Via Engineering Practice, (2007); Women Scientists and Engineers Employed in Industry: Why So Few?

For example, the sentiments expressed in a text concerning a topic in the discussion tend to influence a community when a Twitter user retweets the original text, causing a chain of reactions within a network. This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo. Specifically, we collect the tweets mentioned above and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral. In this context, we address the problem as a multiclass classification problem by using the pre-trained language models ULMFiT and AWD-LSTM, which achieved a Fmicro of 0.85. Finally, we use the classified dataset to conduct a case study in which we capture the sentiment orientation during the network evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; NLP; Online Social Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; ULMFiT","E-learning; Long short-term memory; Polarization; Sentiment analysis; Case-studies; Classifieds; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Hashtags; Hate speech; Language model; Multiclass classification problems; Sentiment analysis; ULMFiT; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Bollen J., Pepe A., Mao H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena, CORR, (2009); Belkin L., Kurtzberg T., Naquin C., Emotional contagion in the online environment: Investigating the dynamics and implications of emotional encounters in mixed-motive situations in the electronic context, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2006); Hillmann R., Trier M., Sentiment polarization and balance among users in online social networks, AMCIS, 24, (2012); Seo K., Pan R., Panasyuk A., Detecting communities by sentiment analysis of controversial topics, SBP-BRiMS, 9708, pp. 206-215, (2016); Collobert R., Weston J., Bottou L., Karlen M., Kavukcuoglu K., Kuksa P., Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch, (2011); Frenda S., Ghanem B., Montes M., Rosso P., Online hate speech against women: Automatic identification of misogyny and sexism on twitter, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 36, pp. 4743-4752, (2019); Sharma S., Agrawal S., Shrivastava M., Degree based classification of harmful speech using twitter data, TRAC, pp. 106-112, (2018); Mathew B., Dutt R., Goyal P., Mukherjee A., Spread of Hate Speech in Online Social Media, (2018); Wulczyn E., Thain N., Dixon L., Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale, (2016); Tsantarliotis P., Pitoura E., Tsaparas P., Troll vulnerability in online social networks, ASONAM, pp. 1394-1396, (2016); Fornacciari P., Mordonini M., Tomaiuolo M., Social Network and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: Towards A Combined Approach, pp. 53-64, (2015); Xu Z., Yang Q., Analyzing user retweet behavior on twitter, ASONAM, pp. 46-50, (2012); Jiang L., Yu M., Zhou M., Liu X., Zhao T., Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification, pp. 151-160, (2011); Speriosu M., Sudan N., Upadhyay S., Baldridge J., Twitter Polarity Classification with Label Propagation over Lexical Links and the Follower Graph, pp. 53-63, (2011); Founta A.M., Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Vakali A., Leontiadis I., A unified deep learning architecture for abuse detection, WebSci, pp. 105-114, (2019); Cao R., Lee R.K.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, Ser.

Despite its emerging prevalence, little is known about the characteristics of revenge porn perpetrators. In the current study, a revenge porn proclivity scale was devised to examine participants' behavioural propensity to engage in revenge porn. One hundred adults, aged 18-54, were recruited online from a community sample. The correlational relationship between revenge porn proclivity and the self-reported endorsement of the Dark Triad, sadism, and ambivalent sexism was examined. Additional proclivity subscales of revenge porn enjoyment and revenge porn approval were also created. The study's main findings revealed a positive correlation between a greater behavioural propensity to engage in revenge porn and higher levels of the Dark Triad and ambivalent sexism. Moreover, endorsement of psychopathy was found to be the only Dark Triad trait that independently predicted revenge porn proclivity. The results suggest that perpetrators of revenge porn may have distinct personality profiles. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. © 2017, IGI Global.","Ambivalent Sexism; Dark Triad; Nonconsensual Pornography; Proclivity; Revenge Porn; Sadism","Ambivalent Sexism; Dark Triad; Nonconsensual Pornography; Proclivity; Revenge Porn; Sadism; Engineering","","","","","","","Alleyne E., Gannon T., Ciardha C O., Wood J.L., Community males show multiple-perpetrator rape proclivity: Development and preliminary validation of an interest scale, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 26, 1, pp. 82-104, (2014); Alleyne E., Tilston L., Parfitt C., Butcher R., Adult-perpetrated animal abuse: Development of a proclivity scale, Psychology, Crime & Law, 21, 6, pp. 570-588, (2015); Revenge Pornography Victims As Young As 11, Investigation Finds, (2016); Berlatsky N., Ethics of Revenge Porn, (2013); Bohner G., Eyssel F., Pina A., Siebler F., Viki G.T., Rape myth acceptance: Cognitive, affective, and behavioural effects of beliefs that blame the victim and exonerate the perpetrator, Rape: Challenging Contemporary Thinking, pp. 17-45, (2009); Bohner G., Pina A., Viki G.T., Siebler F., Using social norms to reduce men's rape proclivity: Perceived rape myth acceptance of out-groups may be more influential than that of in-groups, Psychology, Crime & Law, 16, 8, pp. 671-693, (2010); Bohner G., Reinhard M.-A., Rutz S., Sturm S., Kerschbaum B., Effler D., Rape myths as neutralizing cognitions: Evidence for a causal impact of anti-victim attitudes on men's self-reported likelihood of raping, European Journal of Social Psychology, 28, 2, pp. 257-268, (1998); Brewer G., Hunt D., James G., Abell L., Dark triad traits, infidelity and romantic revenge, Personality and Individual Differences, 83, pp. 122-127, (2015); Buckels E.E., Jones D.N., Paulhus D.L., Behavioral confirmation of everyday sadism, Psychological Science, 24, 11, pp. 2201-2209, (2013); Buckels E., Paulhus D.L., Comprehensive Assessment of Sadistic Tendencies (CAST) (Unpublished Measure), (2014); Buckels E.E., Trapnell P.D., Paulhus D.L., Trolls just want to have fun, Personality and Individual Differences, 67, pp. 97-102, (2014); Buckels E.E., The Pleasures of Hurting Others: Behavioral Evidence for Everday Sadism, (2012); Burris A., Hell Hath No Fury Like A Woman Porned: Revenge Porn and the Need for A Federal Nonconsensual Pornography Statute, (2014); Bushman B.J., Bonacci A.M., Van Dijk M., Baumeister R.F., Narcissism, sexual refusal, and aggression: Testing a narcissistic reactance model of sexual coercion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, 5, pp. 1027-1040, (2003); Citron D.K., Franks M.A., Criminalizing revenge porn, Wake Forest Law Review, 49, pp. 345-391, (2014); Criminal Justice and Courts Bill (HL Bill 49), (2015); Crowne D.P., Marlowe D., A new scale of social desirability independent of psychopathology, Journal of Consulting Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 349-354, (1960); Dick R., McCauley H.L., Jones K.A., Tancredi D.J., Goldstein S., Miller E., Cyber-dating abuse among teens using school-based health centers, Pediatrics, 134, pp. 1560-1567, (2014); Furnham A., Richards S.C., Paulhus D.L., The dark triad of personality: A 10 year review, Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 3, 3, pp. 199-216, (2013); Gannon T.A., O'Connor A., The development of the interest in child molestation scale, Sexual Abuse, 23, 4, pp. 474-493, (2011); Gerhart J.I., Ronan G.F., Russ E., Seymour B., The moderating effects of cluster b personality traits on violence reduction training: A mixed-model analysis, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 28, 1, pp. 45-61, (2013); Glick P., Fiske S.T., The ambivalent sexism inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, 3, pp. 491-512, (1996); Glick P., Fiske S.T., Ambivalent sexism revisited, Psychology of Women Quarterly, 35, 3, pp. 530-535, (2011); Glick P., Whitehead J., Hostility toward men and the perceived stability of male dominance, Social Psychology, 41, 3, pp. 177-185, (2010); Greathouse S., Saunders J., Matthews M., Keller K., Miller L., A Review of the Literature on Sexual Assault Perpetrator Characteristics and Behaviors, (2015); Amanda Todd's Suicide and Social Media's Sexualisation of Youth Culture, (2012); Revenge Porn Cases Increase Considerably, Police Figures Reveal, (2015); Hall J., Benning S., The ""successful"" psychopath: Adaptive and subclinical manifestations of psychopathy in the general population, Handbook of Psychopathy, pp. 459-480, (2006); Hare R.D., Neumann C.S., Psychopathy as a clinical and empirical construct, Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 4, 1, pp. 217-246, (2008); Hatcher R., Who is to blame for 'revenge pornography'?

Implicit bias refers to the unconscious associations and stereotypes an individual ascribes based on affiliation with a particular identity that impacts attitudes, actions, and behaviors. Though individuals may hold egalitarian views, they can still act in ways that reflect an implicit bias that is incongruent with their greater beliefs and/or intentions. While literature and tests on implicit bias exist, to our knowledge, a method to specifically gauge biases that exist in the perceptions and dynamics relating to engineering environments, more directly, does not. This study introduces a novel mixed-methods approach that incorporates biometric testing to gain insight and evidence into the biases that may exist among faculty and students engaging in engineering environments. Specifically, informed by literature on microaggressions and implicit bias, an eye-tracking paradigm is used to draw evidence on existing biases related to sexism, ageism, racism, ableism, and classism. In this study, when prompted, participants are asked to select from a pool of options based on the information presented in a specific scenario. During this selection, the participant's eye movements, specifically their fixation regions and times, are collected to later correlate with their chosen selections. Preliminary findings from this study found individual specific implicit biases to exist. The insights of this work could complement efforts to create awareness of bias for impacting the adoption of attitudes and behaviors more conducive to the cultivation of inclusive environments. © CoNECD 2019.All right reserved.","Engineering; Eye-tracking; Faculty; Graduate; Undergraduate","Eye movements; Biometric testing; Engineering environment; Gain insight; Mixed method; Eye tracking","","","","","","","Chubin D., May G., Babco E., Diversifying the Engineering Workforce, Journal of Engineering Education, 94, 1, pp. 73-86, (2005); May G., Chubin D., A Retrospective on Undergraduate Engineering Success for Underrepresented Minority Students, Journal of Engineering Education, 92, 1, pp. 27-39, (2003); of Engineering R.

Method: Because of data deficiency, the real-time water film depth, the car-following distance, and the vertical curve grade were estimated with available data sources and a GIS analysis to capture rainy weather conditions at the crash location and time. Using a negative binomial regression for crash frequency estimation, the average annual daily traffic per lane, the interaction between the posted speed limit change and the existence of an off-ramp, and the interaction between the travel lane number change and the pavement surface material change were found to increase the likelihood of vehicle to vehicle crashes under rainfall. Results: However, more average daily rainfall per month and a wider left shoulder were identified as factors that decrease the likelihood of vehicle to vehicle crashes. In the crash severity estimation using the multinomial logit model that outperformed the ordered logit model, the travel lane number, the interaction between the travel lane number and the slow grade, the deep water film, and the rear-end collision type were more likely to increase the likelihood of injury crashes under rainfall compared with crashes involving only property damage. Practical implications: As an exploratory data analysis, this study provides insight into potential strategies for rainy weather highway safety improvement, specifically, the following weather-sensitive strategies: road design and ITS implementation for drivers' safety awareness under rainfall. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Crash frequency and severity; Exploratory data analysis; Rainy weather; Vehicle to vehicle; Weather-sensitive strategies","Accidents, Traffic; Age Distribution; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Probability; Rain; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Sexism; Wisconsin; Frequency estimation; Highway planning; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mathematical models; Rain; Regression analysis; Vehicles; Crash frequency and severity; Exploratory data analysis; Rainy weather; Vehicle to vehicle; Weather-sensitive strategies; rain; Average annual daily traffics; Crash frequency; Exploratory data analysis; Negative binomial regression; Pavement surface materials; Vehicle to vehicles; Vehicle-to-vehicle crashes; Weather-sensitive strategies; age distribution; article; classification; computer simulation; Crash frequency and severity; exploratory data analysis; factual database; female; human; male; probability; Rainy weather; regression analysis; risk assessment; sexism; statistical model; statistics; traffic accident; United States; Vehicle to vehicle; Weather-sensitive strategies; Accidents","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2013R1A1A3006898, NRF-2010-0029449); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning ( 2013R1A1A3006898 ).

We found that although men and women are equally productive, women report that their department perceives them as less productive than men. Similarly, women believe they have less influence on, and experience less collegiality in, their departments than men. Women also perceive more sexism and discrimination than men. These quantitative findings are supplemented with qualitative data to more fully understand faculty perspectives. In addition, we found that workplace outcomes such as job satisfaction and turnover intentions are affected by the department climate for both men and women faculty members, which suggests that improving the climate serves all faculty members. Specific recommendations to improve STEM academic climates are discussed. © 2013 by Begell House, Inc.","Faculty retention; Job satisfaction; Quantitative; STEM women faculty; Workplace climate","","","","","","","","Abbasi S.M., Hollman K.W., Turnover: The real bottom-line, Public Pers.

Specifically, the goal of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of what experiences women credited for influencing their self-efficacy, the development of their career interest goals and their academic course outcomes as related to studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This study is unique in that it was also designed to identify experiences that appear to contribute to women's identity development and self-confidence and includes a substantial representation of Latina women's voices. Data was collected and analyzed to identify if similar patterns exist between subjects and if so, which are the greater influencers in their decision to select a STEM major and to persist beyond the critical first two years of undergraduate studies. The literature of socialization and identity development as related to women as STEM learners in diverse communities is reviewed. This study begins to create an understanding of how women think about their multiple social identities (field of study, gender, culture, etc.). Focus group strategies for obtaining in-depth feedback regarding young women's attitudes, perceptions, motivations, and behaviors are discussed. Observations and recommendations regarding the research methodologies for study design and data analysis are presented with particular attention to the rationale for cultural responsive practices in qualitative research. A mixed methods research approach including the use of surveys and focus groups was used to collect student perceptions from junior and senior status students in STEM fields of study. Preliminary results indicate that students identify early personal experiences as building their self-confidence and contributing to their identity development. Drawing on self-perception theory, women appear to develop a more robust sense of persistence and feel that they fit into STEM; even when faced with sexism from other students. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","","","","","","","","","Tinto V., Research and practice of student retention: What next?, Journal of College Student Retention, 8, 1, pp. 1-20, (2006); Spady W.G., Dropouts from higher education: Toward and empirical model, Interchange, 2, 3, pp. 38-62, (1971); National Freshman Attitudes Report, (2012); Jensen L.A., Bridging Cultural and Developmental Approaches to Psychology: New Syntheses in Theory, Research and Policy, (2011); Longwell-Grice H., Longwell-Grice R., Testing tinto: How do retention theories work for firstgeneration, working-class students?, Journal of College Student Retention, 9, 4, pp. 407-420, (2007); Espinosa L.L., Pipelines and pathways: Women of color in undergraduate STEM majors and the college experiences that contribute to persistence, Harvard Educational Review, 81, (2011); Espinosa L.L., Ong M., Orfield G., Wright C., Inside the double bind: A synthesis of empirical research on undergraduate and graduate women of color in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, Harvard Educational Review, 81, (2011); Edzie R.L., Exploring the Factors that Influence and Motivate Female Students to Enroll and Persist in Collegiate STEM Degree Programs: A Mixed Methods Study, (2014); DeGroot E.V., Pintrich R.R., Motivational and self-regulated learning components of classroom academic performance, Journal of Educational Psychology, 82, pp. 33-40, (1990); Hughes R.M., The Process of Choosing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Careers by Undergraduate Women: A Narrative Life History Analysis, (2014); Chang, Hurtado, Newman, Sharkness, What matters in college for retaining aspiring scientists and engineers from underrepresented racial groups, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51, 5, pp. 555-580, (2014); Martinez Ortiz A., Sriraman V., Exploring why undergraduate students leave college STEM fields of study at a hispanic serving institution, American Journal of Engineering Education, (2015); Garcia T., McKeachie W., Pintrich P., Smith D., A Manual for the use of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), (1991); Lindlof T.R., Taylor B.C., Qualitative Communication Research Methods, (2002); Gabay-Egozi L., Parental Field of Occupation and the Gender Differentiation in College STEM Career, (2015); Ackerman P.L., Beier M.E., Kanfer R., Trait complex, cognitive ability, and domain knowledge predictors of baccalaureate success, STEM persistence, and gender differences, Journal of Educational Psychology, 105, 3, pp. 911-927, (2013); Casey M.A., Krueger R.A., Focus Groups: A Practical Guide for Applied Research, (2000); Krueger R.A., Focus Groups: A Practical Guide for Applied Research, (1994); Erikson E.H., Identity and the Life Cycle, Vol. 1 of Psychological Issues, (1959)","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","2015 122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition","14 June 2015 through 17 June 2015","Seattle","113020","21535965","","","","English","ASEE Annu.

This study utilized two measuring instruments on a sample that consisted of 83 pilots and a third instrument on a sample of 52 female pilots and non-pilots. The three measurement instruments used where the Aviation Gender Attitude Questionnaire (AGAQ) to measure gender bias and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) to measure stress among female pilots and the Armstrong Laboratories Aviation Personality Survey (ALAPS) to measure personality dimensions of female pilots. There was a significant difference found between males and females across all factors. While this study concurred with research that suggests that female pilots are at greater risk for negative perceptions and sexism by male pilots, this study did not indicate any greater degrees of depression, stress, or anxiety in females as compared to their male counterparts. However, this study found that female pilots were more like their male counterparts than females as a whole, thus allowing females to fit easer into the more male dominated workplace.","Anxiety; Gender; Personality; Pilots; Stress","Aviation; Risk perception; Stresses; Surveys; Anxiety; Gender; Measurement instruments; Measuring instruments; Personality; Personality characteristic; Personality dimensions; Pilots; Social sciences","","","","","","","Atkinson W., Rethinking the work-class nexus: Theoretical foundations for recent trends, Sociology, 43, 5, pp. 896-912, (2009); Baker S.P., Lamb M.W., Grabowski J.G., Rebok G., Li G., Characteristics of general aviation crashes involving mature male and female pilots, Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 72, pp. 447-452, (2001); Blackburn R., Jarman J., Gendered occupations: Exploring the relationship between gender segregation and inequality, International Sociology, 21, 2, pp. 289-315, (2006); Brown T.A., Chorpita B.F., Korotitsch W., Barlow D.H., Psychometric properties of the depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS0 in clinical samples, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 35, 1, pp. 79-89, (1997); Butcher J.N., Psychological assessment of airline pilot applicants with the mmpi-2, Journal of Personality Assessment, 62, 1, pp. 31-44, (1994); Butcher J.N., Assessing pilots with 'the wrong stuff': A call for research on emotional health factors in commercial aviators, International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 10, 1-2, pp. 168-184, (2002); Caldwell J.A., LeDuc P.A., Gender influences on performance and recovery sleep in fatigued aviators, Ergonomics, 41, pp. 1757-1770, (1998); Clara I.P., Cox B.J., Enns M.W., Confirmatory factor analysis of the depression anxiety stress scales in depressed and anxious patients, Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 23, 1, pp. 61-67, (2001); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Cohen P., Huffman M., Individuals, jobs and labor markets: The devaluation of women's work, American Sociological Review, 68, 3, pp. 443-463, (2003); Cohen S., The Perceived Stress Scale, (1994); Crawford J.R., Henry J.D., The depression anxiety stress scales (DASS): Normative data and latent structure in a large non-clinical sample, British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 42, 2, pp. 111-131, (2003); Davey C., The impact of human factors on AB initio pilot training, Gender, Work, and Organization, 6, pp. 627-647, (2004); Davey C.L., Davidson M.J., The rite of passage?

As microcosms of the larger society in which they are embedded, schools recreate and enforce the heterosexist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic characteristics of the larger culture. Those students with emerging or declared lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) identities are, thus, particularly vulnerable to the impact of heterosexist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic attitudes and the potential resulting violence present in the school setting. Therefore, it is imperative school personnel, including administrators, teachers, school psychologists, and school counselors, among others, become aware of how anti-LGBTQ bias and discrimination are present in schools and what they can do to create and maintain safe and responsive schools for LGBTQ youths. In this introduction to the special issue, some of the challenges faced by LGTBQ youths in schools are outlined and the theme of each article is highlighted. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","bisexual; gay; heterosexism; homophobia; lesbian; queer; safe schools; sexism; students; transgender; transphobia; violence; youths","","","","","","","","Gardner H., Intelligence reframed: Multiple intelligences for the 21st century, (1999); The 2009 National School Climate Survey, (2009); Lasser J., Tharinger D.J., Cloth A., Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth, Children's needs: Development, prevention, and intervention, pp. 419-430, (2006); Luedke M., Transgender and questioning youth: Support strategies for educators, Helping children at home and school: Handouts from your school psychologist, (2010); McIntosh P., White privilege: Unpacking the invisible knapsack, Peace and Freedom, pp. 10-12, (1989); Savage T.A., Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth: Preventing violence and harassment at school, Helping children at home and school: Handouts from your school psychologist, (2010); Savage T.A., Harley D.A., A place at the blackboard: Including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, and questioning issues in the education process, Multicultural Education, 16, 4, pp. 2-9, (2009)","T.

But since work such as Tonso's landmark study, On the Outskirts of Engineering1, a number of cultural changes have occurred, and expectations for what women can do and what fields they can enter. Have those shifts made a difference for women entering engineering programs? In this paper, we explore that question through interviews with 10 women selected based on the results of a survey of first-year engineering students in a large general engineering program at a mid-Atlantic university. Interview subjects were selected based on high domain and high gender identification; that is, the 10 women who were interviewed perceived both being female and being an engineering as important to their self-concept. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using open-coding procedures to identify ways women experience the relationship between their gender and their engineering identities, their experiences with male students (e.g. on design teams, studying for exams, completing homework assignments), and their strategies for navigating gendered dynamics such as peers who did not value their input or who expected them to take on certain roles. The participants rarely responded directly to questions about perceived gendered experiences, but when talking about their experiences in classes or on teams, did describe ways in which they had negotiated their space and their identity, earning respect or demonstrating competence to gain a voice at the table. At the same time, these participants saw no need to give up or mask their femininity, and spoke about embracing and moving easily between identities. The findings suggest that while overt experiences of gender stereotypes or sexism may be decreasing, biases persist; at the same time, women entering engineering programs are both aware of and have strategies for negotiating those biases. The findings suggest opportunities for educators to strengthen women's self-concepts as both women and engineers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.","","Engineering education; Cultural changes; Engineering program; First-year engineering; Gender identification; Gender stereotypes; General engineering; Homework assignments; Women in engineering; Professional aspects","","","","","","","Tonso K.L., On the Outskirts of Engineering: Learning Identity, Gender, and Power via Engineering Practice, (2007); Faulkner W., Dualisms, hierarchies and gender in engineering, Social Studies of Science, 30, PART 5, pp. 759-792, (2000); Faulkner W., Nuts and bolts and people: Gender-troubled engineering identities, Social Studies of Science, 37, 3, pp. 331-356, (2007); Dryburgh H., Work hard, play hard: Women and professionalization in engineering-Adapting to the culture, Gender & Society, 13, 5, pp. 664-682, (1999); Slaughter A.-M., Why women still can't have it all, The Atlantic, (2012); Besterfield-Sacre M., Et al., Gender and ethnicity differences in freshmen engineering student attitudes: A cross-institutional study, Journal of Engineering Education, 90, 4, pp. 477-489, (2001); Bell A., Et al., Stereotype threat and women's performance in engineering, Journal of Engineering Education, 92, 4, pp. 307-312, (2003); Wolfe J., Powell E., Biases in interpersonal communication: How engineering students perceive gender typical speech acts in teamwork, Journal of Engineering Education, 98, 1, pp. 5-16, (2009); Marra R., Bogue B., Self efficacy in women engineering students: Three years of data at U.S. Institutions, American Society for Engineering Education, (2007); Jones B.D., Et al., An analysis of motivation constructs with first-year engineering students: Relationships among expectancies, values, achievement, and career plans, Journal of Engineering Education, 99, 4, pp. 319-336, (2010); Jones B.D., Ruff C., Paretti M.C., The Impact of Engineering Identification and Stereotypes on Undergraduate Women's Achievement and Persistence in Engineering; Schmader T., Gender identification moderates stereotype threat effects on women's math performance, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 38, pp. 194-201, (2001); Schmader T., Johns M., Barquissau M., The costs of accepting gender differences: The role of stereotype endorsement in women's experience in the math domain, Sex Roles, 50, 11-12, pp. 835-850, (2004); Patton M.Q., Qualitative Research & Evaluation Methods, (2002)","","","","","120th ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition","23 June 2013 through 26 June 2013","Atlanta, GA","99351","","","","","English","ASEE Annu.
