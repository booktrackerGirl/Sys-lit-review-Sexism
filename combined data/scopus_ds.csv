The user has freedom to post whatever he/she likes in social networking and blogging sites. However, sometimes the content when directed towards certain group of individuals with an intention to incite hate or discrimination, causes a turmoil in the society. Such content is known as hate speech. Hate speech can be a serious problem to peace and harmony in the society. There are instances where hate speech have led to social unrest and extremism. Thus, hate speech in the internet needs to be monitored. In this paper, we discuss the relevant works done in the field of hate speech detection. Different types of hate speech like racism, sexism, religious hate speech, etc. and the various methods proposed to tackle them are discussed. Further, we identify the challenges and propose the solutions to challenges in hate speech detection in the public internet sphere.  © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Racism; Sexism","Natural language processing systems; Speech; Blogging; Common platform; Internet needs; NAtural language processing; Public internet; Speech detection; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Ghimire A., Thapa S., Jha A.K., Adhikari S., Kumar A., Accelerating business growth with big data and artificial intelligence, 2020 Fourth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC), pp. 441-448, (2020); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Cyber hate speech on twitter: An application of machine classification and statistical modeling for policy and decision making, Policy & Internet, 7, 2, pp. 223-242, (2015); Del Vigna F., Cimino A., Dell'Orletta F., Petrocchi M., Tesconi M., Hate me, hate me not: Hate speech detection on facebook, Proceedings of the First Italian Conference on Cybersecurity (ITASEC17), pp. 86-95, (2017); Banks J., Regulating hate speech online, International Review of Law, Computers & Technology, 24, 3, pp. 233-239, (2010); The Number of Tweets per Day in, (2020); Adhikari S., Thapa S., Singh P., Huo A., Bharathy G., Prasad M., A comparative study of machine learning and nlp techniques for uses of stop words by patients in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 1-8, (2021); Thapa S., Adhikari S., Ghimire A., Aditya A., Feature selection based twin-support vector machine for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, 2020 IEEE 8th R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC), (2020); Malmasi S., Zampieri M., Detecting Hate Speech in Social Media, (2017); Cao R., Lee R.K.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, pp. 11-20, (2020); Park J.H., Fung P., One-step and Two-step Classification for Abusive Language Detection on Twitter, (2017); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 11, 1, (2017); Founta A., Et al., Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of twitter abusive behavior, Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 12, 1, (2018); Gamback B., Sikdar U.K., Using convolutional neural networks to classify hate-speech, Proceedings of the First Workshop on Abusive Language Online, pp. 85-90, (2017); De Gibert O., Perez N., Garcia-Pablos A., Cuadros M., Hate Speech Dataset from A White Supremacy Forum, (2018); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 759-760, (2017); Waseem Z., Hovy D., Hateful symbols or hateful people. predictive features for hate speech detection on twitter, Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pp. 88-93, (2016); Pitsilis G.K., Ramampiaro H., Langseth H., Effective hate-speech detection in twitter data using recurrent neural networks, Applied Intelligence, 48, 12, pp. 4730-4742, (2018); Bartlett J., Reffin J., Rumball N., Williamson S., Anti-social media, Demos, 2014, pp. 1-51, (2014); Calderon C.A., De La Vega G., Herrero D.B., Topic modeling and characterization of hate speech against immigrants on twitter around the emergence of a far-right party in Spain, Social Sciences, 9, 11, (2020); Warner W., Hirschberg J., Detecting hate speech on the world wide web, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Language in Social Media, pp. 19-26, (2012); Basile V., Et al., Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter, 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 54-63, (2019); Albadi N., Kurdi M., Mishra S., Are they our brothers.

This study examines women's experiences of both overt and subtle sexism in the sport industry as well as the impact such experiences have on their careers. Based on interviews and journal entries from women managers working in a men's professional sports league, the findings suggest that the culture of sport organizations perpetuates sexism, including the diminishment and objectification of women. Sexism occurs in women's everyday interactions with their supervisors and coworkers, as well as others that they interact with as part of their jobs. Such experiences result in professional and emotional consequences, which women navigate by employing tactics that enable their survival in the sport industry. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Gender discrimination; Gender inequality; Objectification; Overt sexism; Subtle sexism","","","","","","","","Ahmed S., Introduction: Sexism-A problem with a name. new formations, New Formations: A Journal of Culture/Theory/Politics, 86, 1, pp. 5-13, (2015); Aicher T.J., Sagas M., Are head coaches in intercollegiate athletics perceived as masculine?

In this article, we ask: how does “consent” as an analytical framework make visible the social dynamics and power relations in the capture, extraction, and labor of data science knowledge production? We hypothesize that a form of boundary violation in data science workplaces—gender harassment—may correlate with the ways humans’ lived experiences are extracted to produce Big Data. The concept of consent offers a useful way to draw comparisons between gender relations in data science and the means by which machines are trained to learn and reason. Inspired by how Big Tech leaders describe unsupervised machine learning, and the co-optation of “revolutionary” rhetoric they use to do so, we introduce a concept we call “techniques of invisibility.” Techniques of invisibility are the ways in which an extreme imbalance between exposure and opacity, demarcated along fault lines of power, are fabricated and maintained, closing down the possibility for bidirectional transparency in the production and applications of algorithms. Further, techniques of invisibility, which we group into two categories—epistemic injustice and the Brotherhood—include acts of subjection by powerful actors in data science designed to quell resistance to exploitative relations.

This paper explores three facets of technologically related gendered harm: physical, institutional, and psychological. These harms will be demonstrated by case studies. Firstly, technology can cause physical harm by denying women their bodily autonomy, demonstrated by the public availability of AI software that generates nude pictures of women, and smart home devices used in instances of domestic abuse. Secondly, technology can deny women institutional access, as increasingly widespread algorithms are shown to underperform on marginalised groups. Thirdly, anthropomorphised technology reflects and entrenches harmful stereotypes of women's submissiveness, causing psychological harm. Reducing harm must go beyond ensuring a diversity of representation in STEM fields. We conclude that effective regulation should focus on the design features in technological innovations. © 2020, Australasian Association for Information Systems.","Bias; Diversity; Gender; Machine learning: AI; Sexism; STEM; Technology; Women","","","","","","","","(2018); Family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia: Continuing the national story, (2019); Baranyai K., Bowles J., Hassan S., Prinsley R., Smith P., Walter C., Australia's STEM Workforce, (2016); Bargad A., Hyde J.S., Women's Studies: A Study of Feminist Identity Development in Women, Psychology of Women Quarterly, (2016); Barratt B., The Need For More Women In STEM Roles Goes Beyond Simple Diversity, Forbes, (2018); Bowles N., Thermostats, Locks and Lights: Digital Tools of Domestic Abuse, The New York Times, (2018); Buolamwini J., Gebru T., Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification, Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, 81, pp. 77-91, (2018); Clance P.R., Imes S.A., The imposter phenomenon in high achieving women: Dynamics and therapeutic intervention, Psychotherapy: Theory, Research & Practice, 15, 3, pp. 241-247, (1978); Cole S., Maiberg E., Koebler J., This Horrifying App Undresses a Photo of Any Woman With a Single Click, Vice, (2019); Crenshaw K., Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics, University of Chicago Legal Forum, 1989, 1, (2015); Advancing Women in STEM, (2019); Fricker M., Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing, Epistemic Injustice, (2007); Layne L., Vostral S.L., Boyer K., Feminist Technology, (2010); MacMillan D., Dwoskin E., The war inside Palantir: Data-mining firm's ties to ICE under attack by employees, Washington Post, (2019); McKinley N.M., Hyde J.S., The Objectified Body Consciousness Scale: Development and Validation, Psychology of Women Quarterly, (1996); Medina J., The Epistemology of Resistance: Gender and Racial Oppression, Epistemic Injustice, and the Social Imagination, The Epistemology of Resistance, (2013); Patterson D., Why having more women in tech management is good for business, Tech Republic, (2018); Perry R., Greber L., Women and Computers: An Introduction, Signs, 16, 1, pp. 74-101, (1990); Poulsen A., Burmeister O.K., Overcoming carer shortages with care robots: Dynamic value trade-offs in run-time, Australasian Journal of Information Systems, 23, (2019); Rakow L.F., Gendered technology, gendered practice, Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 5, 1, pp. 57-70, (1988); Richardson K., Sex Robot Matters: Slavery, the Prostituted, and the Rights of Machines, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 35, 2, pp. 46-53, (2016); Rodriguez M., Valentine J.M., Son J.B., Muhammad M., Intimate Partner Violence and Barriers To Mental Health Care for Ethnically Diverse Populations of Women, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse, (2009); Rothschild J.A., A feminist perspective on technology and the future, Women's Studies International Quarterly, 4, 1, pp. 65-74, (1981); Schwar H., Moynihan R., Companies like Amazon may give devices like Alexa female voices to make them seem ""caring. , Business Insider, (2020); Simonite T., When it comes to gorillas, Google photos remains blind, Wired Magazine, (2018); Wajcman J., From Women and Technology to Gendered Technoscience, Information, Communication & Society, 10, 3, pp. 287-298, (2007); Wang Y., Kosinski M., Deep neural networks are more accurate than humans at detecting sexual orientation from facial images, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 114, 2, pp. 246-257, (2017); West M., Kraut R., Chew H.E., I'd blush if I could: Closing gender divides in digital skills through education, (2019); West S.M., Whittaker M., Crawford K., Discriminating Systems: Gender, Race, and Power in AI, (2019); Williams S., Why We Need Women in STEM, Inc, (2014)","L.

Moreover, ease of access to social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. has led to an exponential increase in the mistreatment of people in the form of hateful messages, bullying, sexism, racism, aggressive content, harassment, toxic comment etc. Thus there is an extensive need to identify, control and reduce the bullying contents spread over social media sites, which has motivated us to conduct this research to automate the detection process of offensive language or cyberbullying. Our main aim is to build single and double ensemble-based voting model to classify the contents into two groups: 'offensive' or 'non-offensive'. For this purpose, we have chosen four machine learning classifiers and three ensemble models with two different feature extraction techniques combined with various n-gram analysis on a dataset extracted from Twitter. In our work, Logistic Regression and Bagging ensemble model classifier have performed individually best in detecting cyberbullying which has been outperformed by our proposed SLE and DLE voting classifiers. Our proposed SLE and DLE models yield the best performance of 96% when TF-IDF (Unigram) feature extraction is applied with K-Fold cross-validation. © 2021 IEEE.","Cyberbullying; Machine Learning Classifiers; Offensive Language; Text Classification; Twitter","Cellular radio systems; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Extraction; Feature extraction; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Detection process; Exponential increase; Feature extraction techniques; K fold cross validations; Machine learning approaches; Offensive languages; Social media platforms; Voting classifiers; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Schmidt A., Wiegand M., A Survey on Hate Speech Detection Using Natural Language Processing, pp. 1-10, (2017); Niu G., He J., Lin S., Sun X., Longobardi C., Cyberbullying victimization and adolescent depression: The mediating role of psychological security and the moderating role of growth mindset, Int.

From this perspective, it dissects certain stereotypes constituted at the junction of race and gender which have been incorporated in the novels of Alice Walker. It lays bare the Western politics of representation which deploys the strategy of typifying ‘others’ or Black women, in this context, to marginalize. Walker's works offer Black feminist narratives where once paranoid women raise critical consciousness and challenge conventional assumptions about them. The subversive activities of her fictional women end up reframing those purposive constructs. This paper first explores the mechanism of stereotyping the Black women from its study of three selected novels of Walker and then analyzes why those stereotypes deserve re-interpretation and re-evaluation. It finds that instead of engaging herself in the binary practice of countering the canon, Walker offers through her novels appropriation, re-definition or re-assessment of the racist and sexist tags commonly associated with Black women. In this regard, Walker, her fictional women, and this researcher meet to introduce new dimensions to those stereotypes and advocate for considering cultural diversity and cultural context which shape Black women. To study the stereotypes, this paper takes on a deconstructionist approach, proposed by Collins. For analysis, it also relies on hooks' concepts of Western double-edged standards and Hall's ideas of stereotyping the ‘other’ and politics of representation. It uses content analysis method, limiting itself to look into relevant parts of the studied novels. © 2021 The Author","Alice Walker's novels; Black women; Intersection of racism and sexism; Re-reading; Representation; Stereotypes","","","","","","","","Abbandonato L., A view from ‘elsewhere’: Subversive sexuality and the rewriting of the heroine's story in the color Purple, Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, 106, 5, pp. 1106-1115, (1991); Bobo J., Black women's Responses to the color Purple, Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media, 33, pp. 43-51, (1988); Collins P.H., Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the Politics of empowerment, (2002); Davenport D., African visions.

As leadership incorporates more feminine qualities, gender bias disadvantaging women should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to present an empirical investigation of that argument by examining gender bias in servant leadership. Predictions made by role congruity theory were investigated with principles from leader categorization theory. Design/methodology/approach – In a survey design, 201 working college students from the Midwest USA were presented with either a female or male leader, each with identical servant leader attributes. Participants reported their expectations for the leader’s future behavior. Findings – Expectations for servant leader behavior were greater for the woman than man leader, and expectations for authoritarian behavior were greater for the man than woman leader. Expectations for servant leader behavior were greater from the woman than man participants, and expectations for authoritarian behavior were greater from the man than woman participants, a difference that was enhanced by men’s hostile sexism. Research limitations/implications – Although limited by the sample of working students, important implications are the importance of using theoretical integration to examine contemporary forms of leadership for changing gender bias, considerations of self-concept in bias and examining perceiver characteristics when investigating gender bias. Practical implications – Awareness of the reduction of gender bias in communal leadership may allow an increase of leadership opportunities for women and leadership attempts by women. Originality/value – This is the first empirical examination of gender bias in communal leadership through theoretical integration. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Gender differences; Leadership; Social roles; Stereotypes; Women","","","","","","","","Avolio B.J., Walumbwa F.O., Weber T.J., Leadership: current theories, research, and future directions, Annual Review of Psychology, 60, pp. 421-449, (2009); Barbuto J.E., Gifford G.T., Examining gender differences of servant leadership: an analysis of the agentic and communal properties of the servant leadership questionnaire, Journal of Leadership Education, 9, 2, pp. 4-21, (2010); Bass B.M., Bass R., The Bass Handbook of Leadership: Theory, Research and Managerial Implications, (2008); Cohen J., Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Conrey F.R., Smith E.R., Attitude representation: attitudes as patterns in a distributed connectionist representational system, Social Cognition, 25, 5, pp. 718-735, (2007); Eagly A.H., Carli L.L., The female leadership advantage: an evaluation of the evidence, The Leadership Quarterly, 14, 6, pp. 807-834, (2003); Eagly A.H., Carli L.L., Through the Labyrinth: The Truth about how Women Become Leaders, (2007); Eagly A.H., Johnson B.T., Gender and leadership style: a meta-analysis, Psychological Bulletin, 108, 2, pp. 233-256, (1990); Eagly A.H., Karau S.J., Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders, Psychological Review, 109, 3, pp. 573-598, (2002); Ely R.J., Ibarra H., Kolb D., Taking gender into account: theory and design for women’s leadership development programs, Academy of Management Learning & Education, 10, 3, pp. 474-493, (2011); Gerstner C.R., Day D.V., Cross-cultural comparison of leadership prototypes, Leadership Quarterly, 5, 2, pp. 121-134, (1994); Gigerenzer G., Personal reflections on theory and psychology, Theory and Psychology, 20, 6, pp. 733-743, (2010); Glick P., Fiske S.T., The ambivalent sexism inventory: differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, 3, pp. 491-512, (1996); Glick P., Fiske S.T., Mladinic A., Saiz J.L., Abrams D., Masser B., Lopez W., Adetoun B., Osagie J.E., Akande A., Alao A., Annetje B., Willemsen T.M., Chipeta K., Dardenne B., Dijksterhuis A., Wigboldus D., Eckes T., Six-Materna I., Exposito F., Moya M., Foddy M., Kim H., Lameiras M., Sotelo M.J., Mucchi-Faina A., Romani M., Sakalli N., Udegbe B., Yamamoto M., Ui M., Ferreira M.C., Lopez W.L., Beyond prejudice as simple antipathy: hostile and benevolent sexism across cultures, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, 5, pp. 763-775, (2000); Greenleaf R.K., Servant Leadership: A Journey into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness, (1977); Hausman R., Tyson L.D., Zahidi S., (2012); Hogg M.A., Hains S.C., Mason I., Identification and leadership in small groups: salience, frame of reference and leader stereotypicality effects on leader evaluations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, 5, pp. 1248-1263, (1998); Hogue M., Lord R.G., A multilevel, complexity theory approach to understanding gender bias in leadership, The Leadership Quarterly, 18, 4, pp. 370-390, (2007); Johnson R.E., Lord R.G., Leader categorization theory, Encyclopedia of Leadership, pp. 823-828, (2004); Johnson S.K., Murphy S.E., Zewkie S., Reichard R.J., The strong sensitive type: effects of gender stereotypes and leader prototypes on the evaluation of male and female leaders, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 106, 1, pp. 39-60, (2008); Koenig A.M., Eagly A.H., Mitchell A.A., Ristikari T., Are leaderstereotypes masculine?

Women have, however, been successful obtaining leadership positions in conference offices, as more than 30% of National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I conference commissioners were women in 2016. This research used career construction theory as a framework to explore the experiences of these women. Findings revealed that participants constantly negotiate time spent on personal and professional obligations, and relationships created in the workplace turned into organic mentorship relationships. Participants felt that there were limited amounts of sexism in the workplace, but all discussed experiencing instances of sexism, indicating a culture of gender normalcy. Women may experience increased success in leadership positions at conference offices, compared with oncampus athletic departments, due to limited direct interaction with football and donors. © 2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Athletic administration; Career mobility; College sports; Gender normalcy","","","","","","","","Acosta R.V., Carpenter L.J., Women in intercollegiate sport: A longitudinal, national study, thirty-five year update, 1977-2012, (2014); Anderson E.D., I used to think women were weak': Orthodox masculinity, gender-segregation, and sport, Sociological Forum, 23, 2, pp. 257-280, (2008); Andrew D., Pedersen P., McEvoy C., Research method and design in sport management, (2011); Basford T.E., Offermann L.R., Behrend T.S., Do you see what I see?

Manne’s characterization of misogyny as a ‘hostile forcefield’, and her assertion that women are essentialised as givers, not takers, provide additional traction for understanding why women in combat roles are subject to an array of impossible inconsistencies, whilst the notion of ‘regendering’ provides some promise for beginning to unravel these contradictions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","gendered states; militarized masculinities; misogyny; Women in combat","","","","","","","","Aragones A.F., Women, Body and War: Kurdish Female Fighters through Commander Arian and Girls’ War, Media, War and Conflict, (2020); Ase C., Introduction: Gender, War, and Military Sacrifice, Gendering Military Sacrifice: A Feminist Comparative Analysis, pp. 1-17, (2019); Basham V., Liberal Militarism as Insecurity, Desire and Ambivalence: Gender, Race and the Everyday Geopolitics of War, Security Dialogue, 49, 1-2, pp. 32-43, (2018); Belkin A., Bring Me Men: Military Masculinity and the Benign Façade of American Empire 1898–2001, (2012); Boswell J., Closing Address, Gender Inclusive Army Conference, (2020); Brewster M., Ghosts of Scandals past Stalk Canadian Military as Sexual Misconduct Fallout Grows, CBC Website, (2021); Britzky H., These are the Least Safe Army Posts for Female Soldiers, Task and Purpose, (2021); Burk J., Military Service and Citizenship Status: The Quest for Inclusion by Minorities and Conscientious Objectors, Armed Forces and Society, (1995); Butler J., Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, (1990); Carreiras H., From Loyalty to Dissent: How Military Women Respond to Integration Dilemmas, Women in the Military and in Armed Conflict, pp. 161-181, (2008); Clark L., Delivering Life, Delivering Death: Reaper Drones, Hysteria and Maternity, Security Dialogue, (2021); Cockburn C., Hubic M., Gender and the Peacekeeping Military: A View from Bosnian Women’s Organizations, The Postwar Moment: Militaries, Masculinities and International Peacekeeping, pp. 117-118, (2002); Cohen D.K., Huff C., Schub R., At War and at Home: The Consequences of US Women Combat Casualties, Journal of Conflict Resolution, (2020); Cohn C., Enloe C., A Conversation with Cynthia Enloe: Feminists Look at Masculinity and the Men Who Wage War, Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 28, 4, pp. 1107-1187, (2003); Cohn C., The Perils of Mixing Masculinity and Missiles, New York Times, (2018); Cohn C., “How Can She Claim Equal Rights When She Doesn't Have to Do as Many Push-Ups as I Do?”: The Framing of Men's Opposition to Women's Equality in the Military, Men and Masculinities, 3, 2, pp. 131-151, (2000); Connell R., Messerschmidt J., Hegemonic Masculinity: Rethinking the Concept, Gender and Society, 19, 6, pp. 829-859, (2005); Dhamapuri S., Just Add Women and Stir?, Parameters, 41, (2011); Dover S., Marines Study Shows Resistance to Women in Combat, CBS News, (2013); Duncanson C., Woodward R., Regendering the Military: Theorising Women’s Participation, Security Dialogue, 47, 1, pp. 3-21, (2016); Duncanson C., Forces for Good?

Drawing on and integrating previously disparate literatures on benevolent sexism and social support, we develop a new theoretical model in which benevolent sexism of both women and those in their social networks (i.e., managers and intimate partners) affect women’s acquisition of career social support for advancement at two levels, interpersonal and intrapersonal, and across multiple domains, work and family. At the interpersonal level, we suggest that managers’ and intimate partners’ benevolent sexism may undermine their provision of the needed career support to advance in leadership positions for women. At the intrapersonal level, we suggest that women’s personal endorsement of benevolent sexism may undermine their ability to recognize and willingness to seek out career support from their family members (i.e., intimate partners) and managers for advancement to leadership positions. Implications for theory and future research are discussed. © The Authors 2019.","benevolent sexism; career support; discrimination; gender; leadership; social support; work–family","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (435-2014-1147, 435-2016-0696); Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, MRIS, (ER15-11-169)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by a research grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (#435-2014-1147), Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science (ER15-11-169), and Laurier Early Researcher Award, awarded to the first listed author, and a research grant from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (#435-2016-0696) awarded to the second listed author.","Allen T.D., Eby L.T., Poteet M.L., Lentz E., Lima L., Career benefits associated with mentoring for protégés: A meta-analysis, Journal of Applied Psychology, 89, pp. 127-136, (2004); Archibong U., Sharps P.W., A comparative analysis of affirmative action in the United Kingdom and United States, Journal of Psychological Issues in Organizational Culture, 3, pp. 28-49, (2013); Barrera M., Distinctions between social support concepts, measures, and models, American Journal of Community Psychology, 14, pp. 413-445, (1986); Barreto M., Ellemers N., The burden of benevolent sexism: How it contributes to the maintenance of gender inequalities, European Journal of Social Psychology, 35, pp. 633-642, (2005); Barth J.M., Dunlap S., Chappetta K., The influence of romantic partners on women in STEM majors, Sex Roles, 75, pp. 110-125, (2016); Bear J.B., Cushenbery L., London M., Sherman G.D., Performance feedback, power retention, and the gender gap in leadership, Leadership Quarterly, 28, pp. 721-740, (2017); Becker J.C., Why do women endorse hostile and benevolent sexism?

Authorship attribution is a forensics tool that can help fight against these misconducts when applied to the small texts posted on these platforms. In this work, we exploit the recent developments in language models to tackle the problem of authorship attribution of small messages. Training one model per suspect, we devise a generative approach and compare it against a state-of-the-art discriminative method. Our results show that generative and discriminative features are complementary and can be leveraged to improve the results of current methods. Finally, we propose a strategy to use discriminative and generative models jointly and draw future research paths.  © 2022 IEEE.","Authorship Attribution; Deep Learning; Language Models; Multimedia Forensics; Social Media","Deep learning; Digital forensics; Social networking (online); Authorship attribution; Deep learning; Discriminative methods; Forensic tools; Language model; Large-scales; Multimedia forensics; Social media; Social media platforms; State of the art; Computational linguistics","","","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2017/12646-3, 2018/10204-6, 2019/21030-1)","Google® Latin America Research Awards (LARA) and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) DéjàVu #2017/12646-3, #2018/10204-6, and #2019/21030-1 funded this work. 1https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/","Chen A., The agency, (2015); Davey-Attlee F., Soares I., The fake news machine. inside a town gearing up for, (2020); Kirkpatrick D.D., Who is behind qanon? linguistic detectives find fingerprints, (2022); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 30, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Schuster M., Nakajima K., Japanese and korean voice search, Proc. of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

To this end, we conducted an empirical study in which we visited 37 companies of different sizes in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and interviewed 72 workers with different psychographic traits. These interviews and our field notes were subjected to critical discourse analysis. We identified two a priori categories (“racial gaslighting” and “misogynistic gaslighting”), two emerging ones (“LGBTQIAP+-phobic gaslighting” and “instrumental gaslighting”), and we built the axial category (called “pecuniary gaslighting”). The field revealed that gaslighting occurs in all types of companies and is a manipulation strategy used by white heterosexual men not only on non-hegemonic groups, but also against their peers. As implications for management and the theory, this study discusses and reflects on how discriminatory practices have been naturalized and marginalized, not only in the field of studies, but also in organizational culture © FGV EAESP | RAE | São Paulo","Gaslighting; Lgbtqiap+; Manipulation; Misogyny; Racism","","","","","","","","Abramson K., Turning up the lights on gaslighting, Philosophical Perspectives, 28, pp. 1-30, (2014); Bourdieu P., A dominaqao masculina (9a ed.), (2010); Calef V., Weinshel E., Some clinical consequences of introjection: Gaslighting, The Psychoanalytic Quaterly, 50, 1, pp. 44-66, (1981); Carpenter A., Gaslighting America, (2018); Carrigan T., Connell B., Lee J., Toward a new sociology of masculinity, The making of masculinities, pp. 63-100, (2018); Connel R., Messerschmidt J., Masculinidade hegemonica: Repensando o conceito, Revista Estudos Feministas, 21, 1, pp. 241-282, (2013); Davis A., Ernst R, Racial gaslighting, Politics, Groups, and Identities, 7, 4, pp. 761-774, (2019); Dijk T.

Drawing on sixty interviews with women partners in public accountancy firms in Germany and the United Kingdom, this article examines how women partners talk about sexism and equal opportunities in the accountancy profession and considers how these narratives are patterned cross-nationally. Employing cultural theory, this study explores how elite women discursively relate to sexism and equal opportunities through their career histories and demonstrates the complex interrelation between the context in which these narratives are produced and the past and present positions of the respondents. Interestingly, it was the German respondents who drew on problematic notions of 'choice' and responsibility, where it was upon women to make a choice between their careers and home lives, while this decision-making process was not expected from men. This was in contrast to the accounts of the UK participants who, although also unveiling tensions in their talk, were more inclined to acknowledge continuing structural constraints. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting firms; Feminism; Gender; Sexism","","","","","","","","Acker J., The gender regime of Swedish banks, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 10, pp. 117-130, (1993); Acker J., Inequality regimes.

In this paper, we measure the impact of joining fringe hateful communities in terms of hate speech propagated to the rest of the social network. We leverage data from Reddit to assess the effect of joining one type of echo chamber: a digital community of like-minded users exhibiting hateful behavior. We measure members' usage of hate speech outside the studied community before and after they become active participants. Using Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis as a causal inference method, we gauge the spillover effect, in which hateful language from within a certain community can spread outside that community by using the level of out-of-community hate word usage as a proxy for learned hate. We investigate four different Reddit sub-communities (subreddits) covering three areas of hate speech: racism, misogyny and fat-shaming. In all three cases we find an increase in hate speech outside the originating community, implying that joining such community leads to a spread of hate speech throughout the platform. Moreover, users are found to pick up this new hateful speech for months after initially joining the community. We show that the harmful speech does not remain contained within the community. Our results provide new evidence of the harmful effects of echo chambers and the potential benefit of moderating them to reduce adoption of hateful speech.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Joining; Social networking (online); Causal inferences; Digital communities; Harmful effects; Inference methods; Interrupted time; Online social medias; Online users; Spill over; Spillover effects; Time-series analysis; Time series analysis","","","","","USC-ISI; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (HR001121C0169, HR0011260595)","Funding for this work is provided through the USC-ISI Exploratory Research Award and through DARPA (Award # HR0011260595 and # HR001121C0169)","Almerekhi H., Investigating toxicity across multiple reddit communities, users, and moderators, Companion proceedings of the web conference, 2020, pp. 294-298, (2020); Baicker K., Svoronos T., Testing the validity of the single interrupted time series design, ERN: Hypothesis Testing (Topic, (2019); Baumgartner J., Zannettou S., Keegan B., Squire M., Blackburn J., The pushshift reddit dataset, CoRR, (2020); Cattaneo M.D., Idrobo N., Titiunik R., A Practical Introduction to Regression Discontinuity Designs: Foundations, Elements in Quantitative and Computational Methods for the Social Sciences, (2020); Cervone C., Augoustinos M., Maass A., The language of derogation and hate: Functions, consequences, and reappropriation, Journal of language and social psychology, 40, 1, pp. 80-101, (2021); Chandrasekharan E., Jhaver S., Bruckman A., Gilbert E., Quarantined| examining the effects of a community-wide moderation intervention on reddit, ACM Trans.

One form of social media abuse is misogyny utterance. Misogyny is hatred directed at women. The number of misogyny utterances on social media keeps increasing. Detection of misogyny needs to be done to prevent misogyny utterances. This work examines misogyny on Twitter and proposes a method to detect it. The dataset used comes from tweets on social media Twitter related to women. The experiment in this work was done by comparing the effect of BERT Embedding for Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory. The performance of the methods tested was evaluated based on the resulting accuracy. This work showed that BERT with LSTM surpassed other methods with 86.15% accuracy. The model could outperform other methods because it understands more about the context of the data.  © 2022 IEEE.","bert embeddings; long short-term memory; misogyny detection","Brain; Convolutional neural networks; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Bert embedding; Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Freedom of speech; Logistics regressions; Misogyny detection; Performance; Social media; Speech detection; Embeddings","","","","","","","Sunarto T., kekerasan, dan perempuan, (2009); Perempuan K., Perempuan Dalam Himpitan Pandemi: Lonjakan Kekerasan Seksual, Kekerasan Siber, Perkawinan Anak, dan Keterbatasan Penanganan Ditengah Covid-19, (2021); Siapa Tokoh Terpopuler di Twitter pada 2021?, (2021); Caselli T., Novielli N., Patti V., Rosso P., EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian: Proceedings of the Final Workshop, (2018); Saha P., Mathew B., Goyal P., Mukherjee A., Hateminers: Detecting Hate speech against Women; Parikh P., Et al., Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pp. 1642-1652, (2019); Samghabadi N.S., Patwa P., Pykl S., Mukherjee P., Das A., Solorio T., Aggression and Misogyny Detection using BERT: A Multi-Task Approach; Bensoltane R., Zaki T., Comparing word embedding models for Arabic aspect category detection using a deep learning-based approach, E3S Web Conf., 297, (2021); Fersini E., Rosso P., Anzovino M.E., Overview of the Task on Automatic Misogyny Identification at IberEval 2018, (2018); Salsabila N.A., Winatmoko Y.A., Septiandri A.A., Jamal A., Colloquial indonesian lexicon, 2018 International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP), pp. 226-229, (2018); Ethayarajh K., How Contextual are Contextualized Word Representations?

Misogynistic speech is a kind of abusive language, which can be simplified as hate speech targeting women, and it is becoming a more and more relevant issue in recent years. AMI IberEval 2018 and AMI EVALITA 2018 were two shared tasks which mainly focused on tackling the problem of misogyny in Twitter, in three different languages, namely English, Italian, and Spanish. In this paper, we present an in-depth study on the phenomena of misogyny in those three languages, by focusing on three main objectives. Firstly, we investigate the most important features to detect misogyny and the issues which contribute to the difficulty of misogyny detection, by proposing a novel system and conducting a broad evaluation on this task. Secondly, we study the relationship between misogyny and other abusive language phenomena, by conducting a series of cross-domain classification experiments. Finally, we explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny in a multilingual environment, by carrying out cross-lingual classification experiments. Our system succeeded to outperform all state of the art systems in all benchmark AMI datasets both subtask A and subtask B. Moreover, intriguing insights emerged from error analysis, in particular about the interaction between different but related abusive phenomena. Based on our cross-domain experiment, we conclude that misogyny is quite a specific kind of abusive language, while we experimentally found that it is different from sexism. Lastly, our cross-lingual experiments show promising results. Our proposed joint-learning architecture obtained a robust performance across languages, worth to be explored in further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abusive language online; Automatic misogyny identification; Cross-domain classification; Cross-lingual classification; Social media","Data processing; Information management; Cross-domain; Cross-lingual; Important features; In-depth study; Joint learning; Multilingual environments; Robust performance; State-of-the-art system; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Ahluwalia R., Soni H., Callow E., Nascimento A.C.A., Cock M.D., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets, Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-6, (2018); Anzovino M., Fersini E., Rosso P., Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic language on Twitter, Natural language processing and information systems - 23rd international conference on applications of natural language to information systems, NLDB 2018, paris, france, june 13-15, 2018, proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10859, pp. 57-64, (2018); Artetxe M., Schwenk H., Massively multilingual sentence embeddings for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and beyond, TACL, 7, pp. 597-610, (2019); Badjatiya P., Gupta S., Gupta M., Varma V., Deep learning for hate speech detection in tweets, Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web companion, perth, australia, april 3-7, 2017, pp. 759-760, (2017); Bakarov A., Vector space models for automatic misogyny identification (short paper), Proceedings of the sixth evaluation campaign of natural language processing and speech tools for italian. final workshop (EVALITA 2018) co-located with the fifth italian conference on computational linguistics (clic-it 2018), turin, italy, december 12-13, 2018, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2263, pp. 1-3, (2018); Basile A., Rubagotti C., Crotonemilano for AMI at evalita2018.

Social media networks are rapidly developing. As a result, misogyny is becoming increasingly fashionable. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically classifying misogynistic Bengali messages on social media platforms. Several procedures have been taken to preprocess the data. Tf-Idf and Word Embedding with BERT are implemented so that computers can read text. Several machine learning-based models including Random Forest, SVM Polynomial kernel, SVM Signal kernel, and Adaptive Boosting have been tested to build a multi-class analyzer that identifies Misogynistic text in Bengali on social media. The models have been evaluated with the performance measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. With 62.61 percent accuracy, the SVM sigmoid kernel outperforms all other models. As per our knowledge, no earlier research has been conducted on the classification of Bengali misogynistic text; consequently, the current research is the most comprehensive to date.  © 2022 IEEE.","bert; machine learning; misogynistic text; multi-class; text classification","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Random forests; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Text processing; Bengalis; Bert; Machine-learning; Misogynistic text; Multi-class; Preprocess; Social media; Social media networks; Social media platforms; Text classification; Adaptive boosting","","","","","","","Kemp S., Digital 2022: Bangladesh; Ahluwalia R., Soni H., Callow E., Nascimento A., De Cock M., Detecting hate speech against women in english tweets, EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 12, (2018); Fersini E., Nozza D., Rosso P., Ami@ evalita2020: Automatic misogyny identification, EVALITA, (2020); Ou X., Li H., Ynu-oxz@ haspeede 2 and ami: Xlm-roberta with ordered neurons lstm for classification task at evalita 2020, EVALITA Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian, 2765, pp. 102-109, (2020); Datta A., Si S., Chakraborty U., Naskar S.K., Spyder: Aggression detection on multilingual tweets, Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying, pp. 87-92, (2020); Alawneh E., Al-Fawa'Reh M., Jafar M.T., Al Fayoumi M., Sentiment analysis-based sexual harassment detection using machine learning techniques, 2021 international symposium on electronics and smart devices (ISESD).

For example, the sentiments expressed in a text concerning a topic in the discussion tend to influence a community when a Twitter user retweets the original text, causing a chain of reactions within a network. This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo. Specifically, we collect the tweets mentioned above and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral. In this context, we address the problem as a multiclass classification problem by using the pre-trained language models ULMFiT and AWD-LSTM, which achieved a Fmicro of 0.85. Finally, we use the classified dataset to conduct a case study in which we capture the sentiment orientation during the network evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Hate Speech; NLP; Online Social Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; ULMFiT","E-learning; Long short-term memory; Polarization; Sentiment analysis; Case-studies; Classifieds; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Hashtags; Hate speech; Language model; Multiclass classification problems; Sentiment analysis; ULMFiT; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Bollen J., Pepe A., Mao H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena, CORR, (2009); Belkin L., Kurtzberg T., Naquin C., Emotional contagion in the online environment: Investigating the dynamics and implications of emotional encounters in mixed-motive situations in the electronic context, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2006); Hillmann R., Trier M., Sentiment polarization and balance among users in online social networks, AMCIS, 24, (2012); Seo K., Pan R., Panasyuk A., Detecting communities by sentiment analysis of controversial topics, SBP-BRiMS, 9708, pp. 206-215, (2016); Collobert R., Weston J., Bottou L., Karlen M., Kavukcuoglu K., Kuksa P., Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch, (2011); Frenda S., Ghanem B., Montes M., Rosso P., Online hate speech against women: Automatic identification of misogyny and sexism on twitter, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 36, pp. 4743-4752, (2019); Sharma S., Agrawal S., Shrivastava M., Degree based classification of harmful speech using twitter data, TRAC, pp. 106-112, (2018); Mathew B., Dutt R., Goyal P., Mukherjee A., Spread of Hate Speech in Online Social Media, (2018); Wulczyn E., Thain N., Dixon L., Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale, (2016); Tsantarliotis P., Pitoura E., Tsaparas P., Troll vulnerability in online social networks, ASONAM, pp. 1394-1396, (2016); Fornacciari P., Mordonini M., Tomaiuolo M., Social Network and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: Towards A Combined Approach, pp. 53-64, (2015); Xu Z., Yang Q., Analyzing user retweet behavior on twitter, ASONAM, pp. 46-50, (2012); Jiang L., Yu M., Zhou M., Liu X., Zhao T., Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification, pp. 151-160, (2011); Speriosu M., Sudan N., Upadhyay S., Baldridge J., Twitter Polarity Classification with Label Propagation over Lexical Links and the Follower Graph, pp. 53-63, (2011); Founta A.M., Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Vakali A., Leontiadis I., A unified deep learning architecture for abuse detection, WebSci, pp. 105-114, (2019); Cao R., Lee R.K.-W., Hoang T.-A., Deephate: Hate speech detection via multi-faceted text representations, 12th ACM Conference on Web Science, Ser.

Hate speech detection can be done by utilizing text mining technology. There have been many hate speech detection studies conducted. To identify and analyze research trends, data sources, methods and features used in hate speech detection, this systematic literature review was created. Until early 2020, the topics of hate speech were found, including hate speech against minorities, religion, women, the general election agenda, and politics. Sources of data that are widely used to be used as datasets come from twitter. Hate speech is not only classified into HS (hate speech) and Non-HS (non-hate speech) but can be further classified into racism, sexism, offensive, abusive, threats of violence and others. Of the 38 studies that meet inclusion and exclusion, there are 26 algorithms and 28 features that have been used to detect hate speech. However, these methods and features do not necessarily guarantee a good hate detection performance. Hate speech classification performance is also influenced by the dataset, the features chosen, the number of classes and mutually exclusive classes. © 2020 IEEE.","classification; hate speech; systematic literature review; text mining","Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Intelligent systems; Social networking (online); Speech; Text mining; Detection performance; General Elections; Inclusion and exclusions; Number of class; Research trends; Speech classification; Speech detection; Systematic literature review; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Kitchenham B., Charters S., Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Enginering, pp. 1-44, (2007); Hall T., Beecham S., Bowes D., Gray D., Counsell S., A systematic literature review on fault prediction performance in software engineering, IEEE Trans.

Several machine and deep learning approaches have been proposed recently for detecting various types of aggressive behavior. However, social media are fast paced, generating an increasing amount of content, while aggressive behavior evolves over time. In this work, we introduce the first, practical, real-time framework for detecting aggression on Twitter via embracing the streaming machine learning paradigm. Our method adapts its ML classifiers in an incremental fashion as it receives new annotated examples and is able to achieve the same (or even higher) performance as batch-based ML models, with over 90% accuracy, precision, and recall. At the same time, our experimental analysis on real Twitter data reveals how our framework can easily scale to accommodate the entire Twitter Firehose (of 778 million tweets per day) with only 3 commodity machines. Finally, we show that our framework is general enough to detect other related behaviors such as sarcasm, racism, and sexism in real time. © 2020 IEEE.","online aggression detection; social media; streaming machine learning","Big data; Deep learning; E-learning; Social networking (online); Experimental analysis; Fire-hose; Learning approach; Online aggressions; Real time; Social media; Learning systems","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691025, 830927)","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research leading to these results has received funding from the EU’s H2020 Programme, No 691025 (MSCA-RISE project ENCASE) and No 830927 (project CONCORDIA).

We define CKM as a branch of the Knowledge Management science that deals with marginal and controversial social matters like race, gender, sexism, LGBT and so on. Critical KM is therefore a “twin sister” of Critical Human Resource Development (CHRD) in the bigger field of the analysis of Intangibles. We perform a Literature Review based on the Systematic Literature procedures and using the B-On Database. We conclude that the analysis of issues related to Critical KM is still very scarce and very recent. It seems that being KM a relative new science, social issues have been slow to be addressed; furthermore, KM science has been too much linked with companies and even corporations and with productivity and efficiency.

The social and economic fallout from COVID-19 has further exacerbated gender inequities, through increased domestic violence against women, soaring unemployment rates in women, and increased unpaid familial care taken up by women—all factors that can worsen women's health. Digital health can bolster gender equity through increased access to health care, empowerment of one's own health data, and reduced burden of unpaid care work. Yet, digital health is rarely designed from a gender equity perspective. In this Viewpoint, we show that because of lower access and exclusion from app design, gender imbalance in digital health leadership, and harmful gender stereotypes, digital health is disadvantaging women—especially women with racial or ethnic minority backgrounds. Tackling digital health's gender inequities is more crucial than ever. We explain our feminist intersectionality framework to tackle digital health's gender inequities and provide recommendations for future research. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.
