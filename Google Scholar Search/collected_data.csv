0,Hateful Symbols or Hateful People? Predictive Features for Hate Speech Detection on Twitter,"Hate speech in the form of racist and sexist remarks are a common occurrence on social media. For that reason, many social media services address the problem of identifying hate speech, but the definition of hate speech varies markedly and is largely a manual effort (BBC, 2015; Lomas, 2015). We provide a list of criteria founded in critical race theory, and use them to annotate a publicly available corpus of more than 16k tweets. We analyze the impact of various extra-linguistic features in conjunction with character n-grams for hatespeech detection. We also present a dictionary based the most indicative words in our data.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2016.0,34,1116,200,True,"A list of criteria founded in critical race theory is provided, and these are used to annotate a publicly available corpus of more than 16k tweets and present a dictionary based the most indicative words in the data.",,,,,0,2138053020,Zeerak Talat,2022288,Dirk Hovy,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,"JournalArticle, Conference"

2,SIRI-OUSLY 2.0: What artificial intelligence reveals about the first amendment,"The First Amendment may protect speech by strong Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this Article, we support this provocative claim by expanding on earlier work, addressing significant concerns and challenges, and suggesting potential paths forward.This is not a claim about the state of technology. Whether strong AI — as-yet-hypothetical machines that can actually think — will ever come to exist remains far from clear. It is instead a claim that discussing AI speech sheds light on key features of prevailing First Amendment doctrine and theory, including the surprising lack of humanness at its core.Courts and commentators wrestling with free speech problems increasingly focus not on protecting speakers as speakers but instead on providing value to listeners and constraining the government’s power. These approaches to free speech law support the extension of First Amendment coverage to expression regardless of its nontraditional source or form. First Amendment thinking and practice thus have developed in a manner that permits extensions of coverage in ways that may seem exceedingly odd, counterintuitive, and perhaps even dangerous. This is not a feature of the new technologies, but of free speech law.The possibility that the First Amendment covers speech by strong AI need not, however, rob the First Amendment of a human focus. Instead, it might encourage greater clarification of and emphasis on expression's value to human listeners — and its potential harms — in First Amendment theory and doctrine. To contemplate — Siri-ously — the relationship between the First Amendment and AI speech invites critical analysis of the contours of current free speech law, as well as sharp thinking about free speech problems posed by the rise of AI.",,2017.0,8,25,0,False,,,,,,2,66927574,T.

3,Relationships between Ambivalent Sexism and the Five Moral Foundations in Domestic Violence: Is it a Matter of Fairness and Authority?,"ABSTRACT Ambivalent sexism has served to justify and maintain patriarchy and traditional gender roles characterized by inequality and male domination in the intimate partner violence (IPV) literature; according to the Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) there are two specific moral foundations related to inequality and domination: fairness and authority. We connect these separate fields arguing that sexist attitudes can be related to specific patterns of endorsement of the five moral foundations. Our hypothesis is that ambivalent sexism in men convicted of violence against the partner may be rooted in at least these two moral foundations, and that at least these two moral foundations may also serve to predict intention to change the violent behavior against the partner. Controlling for political orientation, the results show that benevolent sexism correlates positively with the authority foundation; and hostile sexism correlates negatively with the fairness foundation. Both foundations contribute to explaining the two dimensions of ambivalent sexism (benevolent and hostile) and only the fairness foundation predict intention to change the violent behavior against the partner. New treatment approaches could be designed to increase moral concerns about fairness and to reduce moral concerns about authority in people who, at least, have once used violence against their partners.",The Journal of psychology,2017.0,39,21,2,False,"This work connects these separate fields arguing that sexist attitudes can be related to specific patterns of endorsement of the five moral foundations, and shows that benevolent sexism correlates positively with the authority foundation; and hostile sexism correlates negatively with the fairness foundation.",,,,,3,,Maria L.

4,Age Differences in Online Communication: How College Students and Adults Compare in Their Perceptions of Offensive Facebook Posts,"With the most recent US Presidential election, civility in online communication has resurfaced as a social issue. Asurvey of 409 college students and 190 faculty / staff at a liberal arts college in northeastern Pennsylvania used open-ended questions to identifythe types of communicative posts people of different ages have seen and considered offensive on Facebook. Content analysis identified twenty unique themes of online inappropriateness, many of whichare similar across age groups butdo not appear in previous research. Common top themes include racist comments, sex / nudity, political references, and offending visuals. Age differences emerge in the rankings of these four themes and in the identified fifth theme, which is “other social issues” among college students and foul language for adults. Findings also indicate that students were statistically more likely than adults to consider posts involving traditional social issues (racism, sexism, LGBT issues, and alcohol / drugs) or aggression to be offensive; and, adults were more likely to consider foul language or the discussion of politics or religion to be offensive. Symbolic interaction theory is used to link perceptions of offensive posts to judgments of others, and suggestions for further research are discussed.",,2017.0,34,1,0,True,,,,,,4,21544502,Loreen T.

6,"Gender inequalities in the workplace: the effects of organizational structures, processes, practices, and decision makers’ sexism","Gender inequality in organizations is a complex phenomenon that can be seen in organizational structures, processes, and practices. For women, some of the most harmful gender inequalities are enacted within human resources (HRs) practices. This is because HR practices (i.e., policies, decision-making, and their enactment) affect the hiring, training, pay, and promotion of women. We propose a model of gender discrimination in HR that emphasizes the reciprocal nature of gender inequalities within organizations. We suggest that gender discrimination in HR-related decision-making and in the enactment of HR practices stems from gender inequalities in broader organizational structures, processes, and practices. This includes leadership, structure, strategy, culture, organizational climate, as well as HR policies. In addition, organizational decision makers’ levels of sexism can affect their likelihood of making gender biased HR-related decisions and/or behaving in a sexist manner while enacting HR practices. Importantly, institutional discrimination in organizational structures, processes, and practices play a pre-eminent role because not only do they affect HR practices, they also provide a socializing context for organizational decision makers’ levels of hostile and benevolent sexism. Although we portray gender inequality as a self-reinforcing system that can perpetuate discrimination, important levers for reducing discrimination are identified.",Frontiers in Psychology,2015.0,277,179,4,True,"This work proposes a model of gender discrimination in HR that emphasizes the reciprocal nature of gender inequalities within organizations, and portrays gender inequality as a self-reinforcing system that can perpetuate discrimination.",,,,,6,5035886,Cailin S.

7,"Gender, Sexism and the Social Representation of Stalking: What Makes the Difference?","Objective: The present study had 2 main aims: to investigate how ordinary people conceptualize stalking behaviors and to analyze whether respondents’ gender and attitudes toward women are related to the way the phenomenon is described and understood. The research was conducted from the perspective of social representation. Method: Three hundred fifteen university students from Torino who had never experienced stalking completed a questionnaire investigating their knowledge about the phenomenon and the levels of sexism. The participants also provided their free definition of stalking. Results: The results showed that the participants identify the causes of stalking in distorted outcomes of romantic relationships, view its aim as controlling the victims, and attribute psychological pain to victims. Women tended to identify stalking with ambiguous behaviors; hostile sexists tended to undervalue psychological consequences in victims. The representations of stalking showed an opposition between morbidity and aggression in the stalking definition, associated with the endorsement of sexist attitudes toward women. Specifically, benevolent sexism favored a conception of stalking as an annoying but not truly dangerous event. Conclusion: It would be useful to reconsider the contents of prevention initiatives: they have to be directed more toward acting on the symptoms and causes of stalking.",,2017.0,84,11,0,True,,,,,,7,48729597,A.

8,Gender shades : intersectional phenotypic and demographic evaluation of face datasets and gender classifiers,"This thesis (1) characterizes the gender and skin type distribution of IJB-A, a government facial recognition benchmark, and Adience, a gender classification benchmark, (2) outlines an approach for capturing images with more diverse skin types which is then applied to develop the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB), and (3) uses PPB to assess the classification accuracy of Adience, IBM, Microsoft, and Face++ gender classifiers with respect to gender, skin type, and the intersection of skin type and gender. The datasets evaluated are overwhelming lighter skinned: 79.6% 86.24%. IJB-A includes only 24.6% female and 4.4% darker female, and features 59.4% lighter males. By construction, Adience achieves rough gender parity at 52.0% female but has only 13.76% darker skin. The Parliaments method for creating a more skin-type-balanced benchmark resulted in a dataset that is 44.39% female and 47% darker skin. An evaluation of four gender classifiers revealed a significant gap exists when comparing gender classification accuracies of females vs males (9 20%) and darker skin vs lighter skin (10 21%). Lighter males were in general the best classified group, and darker females were the worst classified group. 37% 83% of classification errors resulted from the misclassification of darker females. Lighter males contributed the least to overall classification error (.4% 3%). For the best performing classifier, darker females were 32 times more likely to be misclassified than lighter males. To increase the accuracy of these systems, more phenotypically diverse datasets need to be developed. Benchmark performance metrics need to be disaggregated not just by gender or skin type but by the intersection of gender and skin type. At a minimum, human-focused computer vision models should report accuracy on four subgroups: darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the implications of misclassification and the importance of building inclusive training sets and benchmarks.

12,Camp Horror and the Gendered Politics of Screen Violence: Subverting the Monstrous-Feminine in Teeth (2007),"ABSTRACT This essay argues that Mitchell Lichtenstein’s film Teeth (2007) is an exemplary appropriation of the femme castratrice, a sadistic and castrating female figure that subverts the patriarchal mythologies undergirding the gendered logics of both screen violence and cultural misogyny. The film chronicles Dawn’s post–sexual assault transformation from a passive defender of women’s purity to an avenging heroine with castrating genitals. First, I illustrate how Teeth intervenes in the gendered politics of spectatorship by cultivating identification with a violent heroine who refuses to abide by the stable binary between masculine violence/feminized victimhood. This subversive iteration of rape-revenge cinema is assisted by the filmmaker’s introduction of camp, a playful and self-conscious cinematic style that renders transparent the fantasies guiding the cinematic construction of violence and the male gaze. Second, I argue that this revision of the rape-revenge genre equips audiences with important symbolic resources for feminist critiques of cultural misogyny. Teeth’s avenging heroine updates the sexual politics of second-wave feminism to resist recent political efforts to regulate women’s bodies.",,2016.0,94,17,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'unl.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1200&context=commstudiespapers'}]","CR Kelly - Women's Studies in Communication, 2016 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'CR Kelly', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0LsJs-MAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0LsJs-MAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '0LsJs-MAAAAJ'}]",12,145041977,C.

13,Ethnicity and the geometry of power: One moment in the imagination of the polity,"Ethnicity, for those who subscribe to the concept, is understood to be one 'part of a polity that contains, at least, other 'ethnicities' and probably many other kinds of groupings and 'parts. This paper argues that in order to understand ethnicity, we must seek to understand why it is that people believe that 'society' is composed of 'parts' and to understand how those parts are visualized and 'imagined'. [To say that they are imagined does not means that they are thought of as merely 'imaginary', but rather that they depend on images and beliefs] In short, it is argued that 'ethnicities' are conceptualised quite literally as maps, puzzles, blocks or masses, as groups or sets, as levels or power 'bases'. Ethnicity can be also understood, at a higher level of generalization as one moment, or part, of a complex visualization of other sorts of social power such as 'state, 'family' 'economic', spiritual/ancestral', 'witchcraft/sorcery' and so on. Ethnicity, seen in this way then, appears not as some special 'social formation', but rather as a special case of the visualization (or objectification, reification) and metaphorization of social relations. It is these visualizations that make political rhetoric and recruitment possible. They are objectified in 'ethnic' dress, dance, the built environment, bodily dispositions, ritual forms, and other cultural displays Ethnicity, then, is an aesthetic phenomenon, and must be understood at least partly in these terms. This approach permits us to reason about why special kinds of social power are associated with certain 'ethnicities' and thus to understand the cultural basis for an imagined, socially transmitted and sanctioned geometry of social power. As I sat down to write this paper, a young woman came into my office with an invitation to a ""Macedonian cultural evening"", sponsored by the Greek Embassy, and billing Macedonia as ""the Bridgehead of Hellenism. My immediate reaction was to ask the girl if she was a Macedonian. ""No,"" she replied, ""I'm just Greek, . . . well, actually Cretan. I'm helping to distribute the invitations."" I accepted my invitation, and thought, ""my god, not another ethnicity!!"" The brief interchange had raised a number of interesting points. A 'Macedonian' ethnicity had been distinguished from a ""just Greek"" identity. Depending on how, when and who construed this statement, ""just Greek . . ."" and "". . .well actually Cretan"" might signify national, ethnic, sub-national, supra-ethnic or even historical identities. The Macedonian ""identity"" was further linked to a concrete image of a ""bridgehead"" and an abstract image—that is, and imagination—of Hellenism. 1 A version of this paper was originally presented to the Conference on ""Ethnicity, Society and Conflict in Natal,"" organised by the University of Natal Project on Contemporary Political Conflict in Natal, at University of Natal, Pictermaritzburg on 14 September, 1992. Draft. Printed 03/15/93 al 00:16. Fi1cETHNlCTY.DOC. Pagelofl3 What had happened in these few words? Identities had been claimed, a polity had been identified and partitioned into at least Macedonian and Cretan parts, with the possibility of a ""just Greek"" residuum. I would also take both the concreteness of the 'bridgehead' metaphor and the abstractness of Hellenism to be significant. A tradition had been named ('Hellenism), an emblem selected ('bridgehead'). In order to display these cultural claims, I had been invited to celebrate at a party. Is this ethnicity? Or is it just fun? 1. Ethnicity as the construction of social ""parts. Ethnicity, at the simplest 'folk' level, is the recognition of social and cultural differences in others, and the adoption of an identity by one's self. For 'ordinary people', outside of the discourses of social science, ethnic difference is usually held to be something other than racial or class (economic) difference. It is also held to be a sort of sub-difference within the nation, and people generally believe that national difference and national loyalties normally transcend—and, morally speaking, ought to transcend— ethnic differences. Ethnicity, then, for most people is not racial, may often subsume class difference, and is subsumed in turn by national difference. Among social scientists, however, ethnicity is frequently said to 'cross-cut' these other kinds of differences. Received wisdom asserts that ethnicity is 'caused' by power differences, or by other more 'fundamental' differences such as race or class. For example a social scientist who is committed to a ""class analysis"" will see ethnicity as the consequence of class differences. The phenomenon itself is demoted to the status of sub-identities within a class, or is considered to be subsumed by a ""larger"", often global (or 'worldsystem') pattern of interactions that is ultimately caused by 'economy', 'material' or 'class'. By the same token, a social scientist who is committed to an analysis conceived in terms of racial difference—such as the sociologist Hendrik Verwoerd, or the anthropologist Eiselen, the major architects Apartheid —will see ethnicity as a second-order commitment to local differences that are subsumed by the racial order or things, or that are caused by 'race. The racial order, in their case was, in turn, believed to be subsumed and guaranteed by a God-given religious order, or a natural biological order, and perhaps by both. While the one privileges a metaphysics of the material, the other privileges a metaphysics of physical difference. Both rely on images of a 'more fundamental order which is held to determine ethnicity. Ethnicity is a consequence of something else. I have only given two examples of this, one 'materialist', the other 'racist'. Both views have qualified as valid 'social science' for some and at different periods of time. Some still believe them to be valid. It is not my initial aim, however, to dispute the validity of these particular forms of the causal account of ethnicity. I merely wish to point to the metaphysical underpinnings of these 'social science' accounts and add that these views are rather far from what 'ordinary people' know or feel to be the case. 2 I ask the reader to bear in mind that some metaphysics may indeed be more real or more useful than others-but that is irrelevant here. It is by now obvious that it is difficult to convince 'ordinary people that ethnicity is anything other than what they know and believe it to be. Many instances from the history of the twentieth century show this clearly. The Apartheid State in South Africa, the Soviet Union with its tightly controlled empire, and numerous capitalist democracies have used sophisticated techniques of persuasion ranging from near-total control of the public media to direct and violent coercion either to persuade people that their ethnic identities were not real or that they were other than they thought them to be. For the most part, these exceptionally well-documented attempts to persuade people that their ethnic identities were not genuine or were not somehow fundamental to their well-being, identity and livelihood have failed. What has failed, specifically, is the social scientist's conceptions of what ethnicity meant and what it might mean in the future. It has failed, I think, because social science in all its many varieties, and in all its attempts to support either a political Right or a political Left, has not sought to understand the larger framework of social parts and social powers in which ethnicity plays a part. Attempts to try to portray ethnicity as 'just class in another form, or simply a reflex of race, or as something other than what it is will continue to fail. In fact, we may not be able to say what it is at all, any more than we can say definitively what is race or what is class. We can examine its consequences, however, and we can seek to deconstruct the idea of ethnicity itself. In doing this, we must seek to go beyond the attempts to explain ethnicity as 'really' something else, and to eschew the attractive belief that it is not really there. I want to try to say something, then, about what 'ordinary' people might believe about ethnicity. Beyond that, I hope to say something about an alternative approach to understanding the nature of ethnicity. This is a purely conceptual analysis, a first attempt, and not an empirical analysis of what real people say. It is, moreover, an attempt by a social scientist who is committed to ideas that history is not predictable; that real social processes are necessarily more complex than simple social theories can entirely comprehend; and that people imagine their worlds, construct the terms under which they live in those worlds and yet continue to believe that those worlds are uniquely real; and that life is lived by means of, and in terms of systems of values, symbols and signifiers. I believe that a thorough-going conceptual analysis is necessary before new data can be collected that will do more than simply confirm old beliefs. What ordinary people seem to believe about ethnicity, then, is that it is an inevitable part of the polities in which they live. It appears too, that ethnicity has some sense of concreteness for most people; that is, it is a kind of social part that endures and has a unique character. The concreteness of ethnicity, the special and compelling reality that many people seem to feel is not exclusive of other kinds of identity. It has presence, a sense of sui generis substance. It is is inclusive on most grounds—that is,. most other forms of identity or difference are allowed within the category of ethnic 3 I am using the somewhat peculiar locution 'social part, or 'part' of a polity in order not to prejudice the terms of my argument. 'Part' seems to be the most neutral word in this context.

We examined whether income and racialization were associated with differences in PHC service use, unmet needs, fit with needs, and mental and physical health in a sample of 286 women who had separated from an abusive partner.

19,A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Feminist Beliefs and Feminist Identity Development Among College Women Survivors of Gender-Based Violence,"ABSTRACT Using a mixed-methods approach, we explored how college women’s lifetime experiences of physical or sexual gender-based violence (GBV) were associated with appraisals of GBV and their feminist beliefs or identity (N = 32). Women commented on their increased awareness of the prevalence of GBV, their desire to help other women, and their beliefs about the trustworthiness of men and the current state of gender equality. Women who perceived no or minimal influence of sexism on GBV attributed their GBV experiences to a flaw in themselves or the perpetrators (i.e., self-blame, poor vigilance) or as a reasonable disciplinary measure for their ‘misbehavior.’ We also found that some women reported agreement with pro-feminist beliefs, yet rejected a feminist identity. Our findings illustrate how feminist stigma and sexism might prevent women who endorse core feminist beliefs from characterizing GBV as a sexist event. Given the potential harmful consequences of GBV and other forms of sexism, connecting women with meaningful resources, such as empowering educational programs, nurturing peer-to-peer women’s support groups, and awareness campaigns, may help to facilitate sisterhood and alleviate distress. Our findings also support the need for clinical assessment of how GBV may have affected beliefs about gender, self, world, and others.",,2017.0,41,2,0,False,,,,,,19,6622367,S.

20,Still Stressful After All These Years: A Review of Lesbians’ and Bisexual Women's Minority Stress,"This article reviews the conceptualization of, and empirical literature on, lesbians’ and bisexual women's sexual minority stress. In much of the early research, the experiences of sexual minority women and men were considered together (or women's experiences were inferred from men's), obscuring important differences. There is empirical and theoretical justification to consider the experiences of women and men separately and to develop and evaluate comprehensive models of sexual minority stress for women. Existing conceptualizations of sexual minority stress that include assessment of discrimination, victimization, harassment, concealment, internalized homonegativity may be applied, and perhaps adapted, to facilitate understanding of the unique stressors associated with women's sexual minority status. Future research must include mediators of the relationship between stressors and outcomes such as individual (e.g., coping and resilience) and group (e.g., social support, identification with a sexual minority community) resources. It is also essential to understand what factors may buffer the deleterious effects of these stressors.",Journal of Lesbian Studies,2012.0,62,55,5,False,There is empirical and theoretical justification to consider the experiences of women and men separately and to develop and evaluate comprehensive models of sexual minority stress for women.,,,,,20,144563004,Robin J.

To conduct this study, I have relied upon a combination of the theories of identification and gender performance theory to show how the virtual assistants enact gender with users. The findings of this analysis demonstrate that the virtual assistants easily enact harmful gender stereotypes because the virtual assistants are disembodied representations of femininity.

22,"Transgender-specific developmental milestones and associated experiences of violence, discrimination, and stigma among Filipinx transgender women who are sexually active with men","Background For transgender people, reaching transgender (trans)-specific developmental milestones, including recognizing and expressing one’s identity, plays an integral role in overall health, wellbeing, and the pursuit of gender affirmation. Yet trans people continue to face minority stressors, including structural violence (i.e., discrimination, violence, and stigma), which may interfere with the achievement of these milestones. Among trans women specifically, however, potential associations between gender developmental milestones and structural violence are not well characterized in the literature. In a sample of Filipinx (i.e., an inclusive term for describing non-binary genders in the Philippines) trans women who are sexually active with men (trans-WSM), we thus sought to: (a) describe the mean ages at which gender developmental milestones occur and (b) examine the associations between structural violence and mean ages at which at which Filipinx trans-WSM experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Methods Using data from Project #ParaSaAtin, an online survey of Filipinx trans-WSM (n = 139), we mapped age-estimates per trans-specific milestones and then tested whether structural violence is associated with the mean age at which trans women experience trans-specific developmental milestones. Results Overall, participants who reported higher levels of discrimination, stigma, and violence also experienced a later age for nearly each milestone (i.e., initial self-awareness of transfeminine identity, transfeminine expression in private, transfeminine expression in public, first consensual oral/vaginal/anal sex with a cisgender male partner, first consensual oral/vaginal/anal sex with a cisgender male partner as a trans women, and hormone integration) (all p-values <0.05). Of note, the single exception to this pattern was the non-significant association between stigma and initial disclosure of transfeminine identification to another person. Conclusion Results are consistent with psychological literature outlining a temporal sequence of developmental milestones among young trans-WSM. For young trans-WSM in the Philippines, data from this study demonstrate significant associations between structural violence and the achievement of developmental milestones. These findings highlight the need for trauma-informed, strengths-based programming and institutional policies that measure and mitigate anti-trans violence.",PLoS ONE,2021.0,48,3,0,True,"For young trans-WSM in the Philippines, data from this study demonstrate significant associations between structural violence and the achievement of developmental milestones, and highlight the need for trauma-informed, strengths-based programming and institutional policies that measure and mitigate anti-trans violence.",,,,,22,49488000,A.

Because of dissimilar appearance and racism, transracial adoptive families may be particularly devalued. White American undergraduates (N = 167) were randomly assigned to view an adoptive family photograph of White parents holding either a Black or White infant. Viewing a transracial family elicited less favorable adoption attitudes and greater negative emotions than viewing a same-race family. Participants’ own racism amplified the effect of the transracial family on negative emotions. Results suggest that transracial adoptive families are devalued due to negative feelings elicited by both dissimilar appearance and individual racism.",,2013.0,48,11,0,False,,,,,,23,47266357,Jennifer Katz,2082810014,Emily K.

I combine methods from text mining, machine learning and econometrics to study the existence and extent of gender stereotyping on the Economics Job Market Rumors forum. I first design a propensity score model to infer the gender a post mainly refers to from text, and simultaneously identify the individual words with the strongest association with gender. The words selected provide a direct look into the gender stereotyped language on this forum. Through a topic analysis of the posts, I find that when women are under discussion, the discourse tends to become significantly less academic or professionally oriented, and more about personal information and physical appearance. Moreover, a panel data analysis reveals the state dependence between the content of posts within a thread. In particular, once women are mentioned in a thread, the topic is likely to shift from academic to personal. Finally, I restrict the analysis to discussions about specific economists, and find that high-profile female economists tend to receive more attention on EJMR than their male counterparts.",,2017.0,17,42,0,False,,,,,,24,115016813,Alice H.

25,War on women: interlocking conflicts within The Vagina Monologues in China,"ABSTRACT Chinese university students’ promotion and performance of the feminist play The Vagina Monologues in 2013 triggered a heated debate and a strain of misogyny in social media, which demonstrate how people perceive feminism in China. Through quantitative content analysis and qualitative text analysis of 533 online comments on this feminist activity, this paper investigates the conflicts and contradictions within feminism in China and four frames (meaning packages) are identified. Three of them, namely the ‘public–private conflict’ frame, the ‘Western-Chinese conflict’ frame, the ‘class conflict’ frame, were employed to express opposition, whereas only one feminist frame held a supportive stance. Feminism in China is found to be perceived as morally deviant, foreign-rooted, and intertwined with issues like nationalism, social polarization, and a modernization-tradition contradiction. In this event, social media facilitated the diffusion of misogyny as well as served as public sphere wherein diverse and deliberative discussion was allowed.",,2016.0,80,26,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/60154590/AJCWar_on_women_interlocking_conflicts_within_The_Vagina_Monologues_in_China20190729-31333-xjx6zq.pdf'}]","Y Huang - Asian journal of communication, 2016 - Taylor & Francis",,25,2118271474,Ya-Ling Huang,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
26,Why does it happen? Explanations for men’s violence against women by women with interpersonal victimization histories,"Abstract Men’s violence against women (MVAW) has been identified as a critical sociocultural problem. Gaining a better understanding of perspectives on the etiology of violence held by women with histories of male-perpetrated interpersonal violence provides insight into the processes of victimization and recovery. Furthermore, emerging research suggests that feminist beliefs may facilitate recovery and impact how survivors of MVAW perceive it. In this study, we aimed to explore, in women with histories of interpersonal violence, (1) the ways they explained the high prevalence of MVAW and (2) associations between the strength of their feminist beliefs and the participants’ explanations. Female college students (N = 32, ages 18–22) participated in qualitative interviews in which they were first presented with published statistics about the frequency of MVAW, then asked to provide explanations for the high prevalence of this phenomenon. Individual responses clustered into one or more of four factors: (1) societal influences, (2) blaming women, (3) familial influences, and (4) characteristics of men and women. The extent to which participants identified with feminist beliefs was associated with how they perceived their own victimization. Women who endorsed strong feminist beliefs more frequently cited societal influences on MVAW, whereas women who endorsed feminist beliefs less strongly were more likely to blame women for it and offered stereotypical views of women as passive and fragile.",,2017.0,88,5,0,False,,,,,,26,48808991,Julia R.

37,How the disadvantaged appraise group-based exclusion: The path from legitimacy to illegitimacy,"Although many forms of differential treatment based on group membership are perceived to be legitimate, disadvantaged group members’ responses to discrimination have been studied primarily in contexts in which such treatment is appraised as illegitimate. This has resulted in an impoverished understanding of differential group-based treatment and a failure to illuminate the processes by which discrimination can shift from being seen as legitimate to being viewed as illegitimate. We discuss the determinants of disadvantaged group members’ legitimacy appraisals and the de-legitimisation process, whereby forms of discrimination appraised as legitimate come to be increasingly perceived as illegitimate. Whether group-based exclusion is addressed collectively or individually depends on socio-structural factors such as the pervasiveness of discrimination, impermeability of intergroup boundaries, and the availability of cognitive alternatives to the status quo. We conclude that understanding the antecedents and consequences of legitimacy appraisals is necessary to develop a comprehensive account of disadvantaged group members’ experiences of group-based discrimination.",,2013.0,84,35,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/53110518/How_the_disadvantaged_appraise_group-bas20170512-3613-183hoef.pdf'}]","J Jetten, A Iyer, NR Branscombe… - European Review of …, 2013 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'J Jetten', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3gbpwLsAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=3gbpwLsAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '3gbpwLsAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'A Iyer', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DT4R-xIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=DT4R-xIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'DT4R-xIAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'NR Branscombe', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EA_OQ9wAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=EA_OQ9wAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'EA_OQ9wAAAAJ'}]",37,2515554,J.

An Examination of Minority Stress and Resilience on Depressive Symptomatology Among Sexual Minority Men in Two Urban Areas of Brazil,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the generalizability of the minority stress model on predicting depressive symptomatology among sexual minority men living outside of the United States. In addition, the role of resilience and its relationship between individual minority stressors and depressive symptomatology is examined. The study utilized online purposive sampling and focused on sexual minority men living in Brazil; participants’ (N 388) ages ranged from 18 to 56 years (Mage 25.31, SDage 7.87, Mdnage 23). Participants completed measures that assessed sociodemographics, minority stressors, resilience, and symptoms of depression. Results of a hierarchical regression indicated that, while accounting for sociodemographics, enacted stigma and internalized homonegativity independently predicted participants’ depressive symptomatology, whereas concealment of sexual identity did not. Further, to assess the role of resilience, while accounting for the effects of sociodemographics and minority stressors, results suggested that resilience significantly added to predicting depressive symptomatology and indicated that enacted stigma was the only minority stressor that significantly predicted depressive symptomatology. Lastly, when interactions between individual minority stressors and resilience were added to the model, results suggested that resilience moderated the relationship between concealment of sexual orientation and depressive symptomatology. The study’s findings highlight the importance of considering sociocultural context and resilience in evaluating minority stress and depressive symptomatology among sexual minorities.

Findings demonstrated statistically significant differences where positive bystander attitudes and violence prevention efficacy correlated with direct intervention for sexual assault; positive bystander attitudes, personality extroversion, and exposure to a victim increased intervention behavior in an IPV scenario, and positive bystander attitudes and violence prevention efficacy increased direct intervention and lifetime experience of IPV decreased direct intervention in a sexual harassment scenario.

New Rrevised Juvenile Law was revised in Korea and created provisions to strengthen human rights for juvenile. The Protective Disposition, Juvenile Probation and Parole has been carried out, based on lots of laws and regulations. The recent amendment of Juvenile law will cause a lot of changes for The Protective Disposition, Juvenile Probation and Parole since they are mainly based on Juvenile law. There are neverthless some challenges to be resolved in order to operate these new systems. The amendment shows the improvement and efforts to solve the problems discussed for a long time, such as the minimum age of juvenile offenders and diverse probation and parole programs. Neverthless, many new programs have left new problems to be solved. Juvenile offenders can be punished both by recently introduced short-term detention in a correctional insitution, as a shock probation, and short-term and long-term probation, following the latest juvenile law. It is needed to analyze the effectiveness of varied programs and to study how to improve the probation system within given sources efficiently. To solve these problems, specialized organizations for juvenile delinquent such as Department of Justice should appoint certain private facilities so that the facilities should be intensively managed and supervised. This study suggest the alternatives to improve the effectiveness of the Protective Disposition. The perception of the disposition should be reshaped to impose proper measures on juveniles who is in early stage of delinquency",,2012.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,40,52066255,박영규,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

44,The Labeling Process and Other Interdisciplinary Similarities between Buddhism and General Semantics,"I remember taking a communication course during my early undergrad years. The course title was Interpersonal Communication and was taught by one of the professors from the Speech Communication Department. One of the basic aspects taught in the course was the concept of labeling. We are probably well aware of how humans assign labels to aggregate groups; humans have the attribute of using our intelligence to quickly size up a situation, and put our perceptions into some category, in order to respond to the need of the moment. This may be a healthy or unhealthy response to the context of how labeling is used. We are also symbol-making beings; it's very nice to be able to think quickly and place a person, group, object, or place into a neat little bundle with a comfortable spot in a box with a label on it. We humans don't do well with a lot of uncertainty in our lives or in the ""world out there."" The capacity of acting quickly in a threatening situation is an inherent survival skill. Each of us has acquired specific survival patterns that eventually motivate themselves into a kind of ""reactive repertoire."" ""The awkwardness and paranoia that ensues from the uninvestigated assumptions that we associate with particular labels, is, in itself a major cause of breakdown in communication and a source of destructive responses to conflict."" (1) I remember once seeing an animated video that graphically depicted how we humans box ourselves in by the labels we put on ourselves and others. The star of this video was a strange-looking little creature (I'm not quite sure whether he should get the label of human or not), inside a generic, cardboard box, and he was frantically attempting to find a way out. He would put his feet on one side and push until he was red in the face, and I had some concerns that he might be prone to a heart attack while in the confines of his small home, a little box. He tried everything of which he could think as a way to solve his problem: using feet, hands, arms, and even trying to break out through the seams. He was doing so much work in there that the walls of the box were breathing in and out like a mini hurricane. Eventually he found a space, but he had to flatten himself, the best he could, to squeeze himself out; he got a foot and an arm out, but the other side couldn't find the moxie to follow the leader--the rest of his body! At long last with excruciating alacrity and grit, he popped out. The ironic end of this cartoon tale was that after he finally got out, he began to feel sad that he was no longer in the box. He'd grown accustomed to it, and missed the inside, because it had morphed into his real home. He was grieving the loss of his former home. After crying for a while, and feeling sorry for himself, he decided he would go back inside--going back was just as hard as getting out, but ultimately he reached his goal. He sat in the box and smiled to himself--like the cat that ate the canary--he felt so satisfied to be in familiar environs. He was at last home. It's my opinion that this little cautionary tale reflects both the views of Buddhism and general semantics and one example, the Buddhist teaching of the principle of inaction: this doesn't mean that no one ever does anything and simply sits down all our day on the meditation cushion. Rather, it means that we work at detaching from our own ego that wishes to take action all the time, gets the big head over his or her action, and strives to get whatever she/he needs to meet the ego's desires, cravings, addictions, obsessions with materialistic objects, and conditioned attachments. Most of us are very attached to fixing some problem or controlling some situation. Inaction is the antidote for this. Albeit it's not action or inaction that ought to concern us, but it's our attachment to ourselves {our ego} which emerges as an obstacle. The box metaphor is a good one to describe the evaluative process. …",,2014.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,44,1484838504,Christopher Bear-Beam,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

50,Trans*forming college masculinities: carving out trans*masculine pathways through the threshold of dominance,"Abstract Men and masculinities studies are gaining prominence in higher education literature, illuminating how cisgender college men understand and grapple with masculinity. Additionally, the increased visibility of trans* students has fueled the expanding scholarship and attention to their experiences, often however centering on white gender-conforming trans* students with little if any focus on their multiple and intersecting identities. The gap between these two strands of literature risks reifying hegemonic masculinity and genderism, as masculinities continue to be theorized as exclusively shaped and embodied by cisgender men. Through post-intentional and queer phenomenologies, this study seeks to fill that gap by investigating how trans*masculine students conceptualize masculinity/ies, and how that conception is informed by various intersecting and salient identities. Through a multifaceted conceptual framework and disruptive phenomenologies, the study positions trans*masculine students as agentic worldmakers, constructing trans*masculine pathways, with implications for building toward gender liberation for themselves and others.",What’s Transgressive about Trans* Studies in Education Now?,2017.0,81,29,2,False,,,,,,50,13464758,T.

54,Bot-based collective blocklists in Twitter: the counterpublic moderation of harassment in a networked public space,"ABSTRACT This article introduces and discusses bot-based collective blocklists (or blockbots) in Twitter, which have been developed by volunteers to combat harassment in the social networking site. Blockbots support the curation of a shared blocklist of accounts, where subscribers to a blockbot will not receive any notifications or messages from accounts on the blocklist. Blockbots support counterpublic communities, helping people moderate their own experiences of a site. This article provides an introduction and overview of blockbots and the issues that they raise about networked publics and platform governance, extending an intersecting literature on online harassment, platform governance, and the politics of algorithms. Such projects involve a more reflective, intentional, transparent, collaborative, and decentralized way of using algorithmic systems to respond to issues of platform governance like harassment. I argue that blockbots are not just technical solutions but social ones as well, a notable exception to common technologically determinist solutions that often push responsibility for issues like harassment to the individual user. Beyond the case of Twitter, blockbots call our attention to collective, bottom-up modes of computationally assisted moderation that can be deployed by counterpublic groups who want to participate in networked publics where hegemonic and exclusionary practices are increasingly prevalent.",,2016.0,57,70,13,True,"It is argued that blockbots are not just technical solutions but social ones as well, a notable exception to common technologically determinist solutions that often push responsibility for issues like harassment to the individual user.",,"[{'title': 'escholarship.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://escholarship.org/content/qt6nb9m5wg/qt6nb9m5wg.pdf'}]","RS Geiger - Information, Communication & Society, 2016 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'RS Geiger', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0AvWi3wAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0AvWi3wAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '0AvWi3wAAAAJ'}]",54,143984380,R.

55,What do two men kissing and a bucket of maggots have in common? Heterosexual men’s indistinguishable salivary α-amylase responses to photos of two men kissing and disgusting images,"ABSTRACT The current study sought to examine how Utah men’s physiological reactions to viewing same-sex public displays of affection (PDA), measured through salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), differ as a function of sexual prejudice, as assessed using the Attitudes Towards Lesbians and Gay Men Scale (ATLG) and the Modern Homonegativity Scale. In examining physiological responses to same-sex PDA, the present study hoped to assist in explaining current levels of anti-gay hate crimes despite growing positive public opinion for the LGBTQ community. Participants in the current study viewed six different slide shows depicting same-sex PDA, mixed-sex PDA, everyday items, and disgusting images, while providing saliva samples in the lab. A series of paired-samples t-tests was performed and found that sAA responses to images of same-sex kissing (t(98) = 3.124, p = .002) and universally disgusting images (t(98) = 2.128, p = .036) were significantly greater than sAA responses to the slide show depicting everyday items. This result held across the full sample, regardless of individual levels of prejudice. The results of the current study suggest that all individuals, not just highly sexually prejudiced individuals, may experience a physiological response indicative of stress when witnessing a male same-sex couple kissing. The possibility of a socialised disgust response to same-sex PDA is discussed.",,2017.0,57,13,1,False,,,,,,55,1410238253,Breanna O'Handley,123420920,Karen L. Blair,113486887,R.

56,Mechanical genders: how do humans gender robots?,"Abstract This paper discusses the concept of ‘mechanical genders’ by using robots as a case. Different aspects of robotic gender, or the lack of it are described, showing how some robots have an ‘anything is fine’ gender, where the user decides what gender their robot should have. This is often seen with zoomorphic robots, i.e. animal-looking robots, which in a gender notion seem to be more gender-neutral than their android counterparts. The paper emphasizes how difficult it can be to not gender robots in a Western language context, where robots often need gendered pronouns if they are to be discussed, and shows comparatively how gender can be less important in the Japanese language. Additionally, heavily gendered robots are discussed, defining ‘mechanical genders’ as a concept used to speak about the genders of robots, and see this in relation to established human gender definitions. The paper discusses gender in robots such as Pepper, the robot twin ‘Matsukoroid’ (a trans-robot with his/her/its own TV-show), and sex-robots, as well as gender for cyborgs. The aim of the paper is to show how our mechanical species of robots are affected by the gendering habits of humans.

58,Minority Stress And Daily Affect Among Gay And Bisexual Men,"Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to examine the possible time-variant relationship between daily minority stress and same-day affect among gay and bisexual men. Additionally, this study sought to determine whether a lagged association exists between daily minority stress and next-day affect. Lastly, this study examined trajectories of minority stress and affect during the course of the study period. Methods: 371 gay and bisexual men in New York City completed a 30-day daily diary, recording daily experiences of minority stress and daily measures of positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), and anxious arousal (AA) (n = 8,415 diary days). Multilevel analyses were run to examine significant relationships between minority stress and affect. Results: Results indicated that daily minority stress significantly predicted a same-day negative relationship with PA and significantly predicted a same-day positive relationship with both NA and AA. In cross-lagged analyses, results indicated that daily minority stress did not significantly predict subsequent-day PA, but significantly predicted a subsequent-day positive relationship with both NA and AA. Over the course of the study period, levels of minority stress and affect decreased slightly, but significantly, among study participants. Conclusions: This is the first study to establish a time-variant relationship between sexual minority stress and affect with implications for gay and bisexual men’s mental health more generally. The cross-lagged analysis provides evidence for a potentially causal pathway between minority stress and the affective basis of mood and anxiety disorders among gay and bisexual men.",,2014.0,76,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'yale.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://elischolar.library.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1073&context=ysphtdl'}]",AI Eldahan - 2014 - elischolar.library.yale.edu,,58,6620666,Adam I.

60,Transing the small screen: loving and hating transgender youth in Glee and Degrassi,"The teen television shows Glee (2009-) and Degrassi (2001-) are notable for diversity in gender and sexuality representations. Glee represents a variety of masculine women and feminine men as well as gay, lesbian, and bisexual characters. Likewise, Canada's Degrassi franchise has portrayed non-heterosexual characters in significant and controversial ways. Its most recent incarnation, Degrassi (previously Degrassi: The Next Generation) is discussed in this article, alongside Glee, in relation to their recent inclusions of two transgender-identified teenagers bringing transgenderism to the fore of these programmes' discussions of gender and identity. As trans youth are highly vulnerable due to both systemic ageism and cisgenderism, it is not surprising that both detail narratives of discrimination and assault driven by bigotry and ignorance. Conversely, they also explore more positive aspects of the lives of young people, such as friendship and romance (even as these cause their own problems at times), also enjoyed by trans youth. As such, the themes of ‘love’ and ‘hate’ manifest in interesting ways in both of these televisual texts and guide this article's analysis. While challenging assumptions that trans lives are governed by negative emotional states, these representations continue to reify stereotypes, not only of transness, but also of boyhood, girlhood, race and their intersections. Both representations are grounded in material and emotional journeys (or movements) and the concept of the ‘moving body’ (Keegan, 2013) partly informs these readings. The privileging of certain modes of trans personhood and embodiment over less normative (unseen, unacknowledged, and thus invisible) ones is at stake in these representations, but they also lay the groundwork for diverse future depictions. By addressing this gap in research, this article elucidates how gender (diversity) is being constructed for consumption on adolescent television and its potential for (re)thinking trans/gender, identity, and embodiment for young people in contemporary Western societies.",Diversity in Gender and Visual Representation,2015.0,72,23,2,True,,,"[{'title': 'deakin.edu.au', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30093731/sandercock-transingthesmall-post-2018.pdf'}]","T Sandercock - Journal of Gender Studies, 2015 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'T Sandercock', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MbYIjgcAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=MbYIjgcAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'MbYIjgcAAAAJ'}]",60,153632507,Tom Sandercock,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

65,Working the fields of big data: Using big-data-augmented online ethnography to study candidate–candidate interaction at election time,"ABSTRACT The paper proposes big-data-augmented ethnography as a novel mixed-methods approach to studying political discussions in a hybrid media system.

Candidate–candidate interaction crossing party boundaries is scarce and occurs in the form of negative campaigning via social media, with the shaming of rival candidates and engaging in battles with them.

67,The utility of narratives for promoting radicalization: The case of the Animal Liberation Front,"Although terrorism scholars have begun to recognize the role of communication in the promotion of radicalization, there have been few (if any) studies to explore the radicalizing effects of specific types of communication. To redress this oversight, this study seeks to investigate one of the most prevalent types of communication used by terrorist groups – narratives. Specifically, this study features a theme analysis of narratives disseminated by a specific terrorist group, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), and a discussion of the ways in which the ALF's narrative themes may promote the adoption of beliefs, attitudes, and intentions that are consistent with the group's ideology. Results demonstrate that the ALF narratives are primarily comprised of 10 themes that may promote radicalization through identification with story characters, elicitation of emotional responses, and distinction of in-groups and out-groups. Future avenues of research, including the development of counter-narratives, are also discussed.",,2015.0,92,47,2,False,,,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/49838851/Braddock_2015.pdf'}]","K Braddock - Dynamics of Asymmetric Conflict, 2015 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'K Braddock', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=en3_dNwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=en3_dNwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'en3_dNwAAAAJ'}]",67,2482706,Kurt Braddock,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
68,“There Must be Some Way Out of Here”: Why the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities is Potentially the Best Weapon in the Fight Against Sanism,"It is impossible to consider the impact of anti-discrimination law on persons with mental disabilities without a full understanding of how sanism permeates all aspects of the legal system – judicial opinions, legislation, the role of lawyers, juror decision-making – and the entire fabric of society. For those unfamiliar with the term, I define “sanism” as an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry, 1 that permeates all aspects of mental disability law and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: litigants, fact finders, counsel, and expert and lay witnesses. 2  Notwithstanding over two decades of anti-discrimination laws 3 and, in many jurisdictions, an impressive corpus of constitutional case law and state statutes, 4 the attitudes of judges, jurors and lawyers often reflect the same level of bigotry that defined this area of law half a century ago. 5 The reasons for this are complex and, to a great extent, flow from centuries of prejudice – often hidden prejudice, often socially acceptable prejudice 6 – that has persisted in spite of prophylactic legislative and judicial reforms, and – at least superficially – an apparent uptick in public awareness. I have railed multiple times about the “irrational,” “corrosive”, “malignant” and “ravaging” effects of sanism, but its “pernicious power” still poisons all of mental disability law. 7  The recently-ratified Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is the most revolutionary international human rights document – ever – that applies to persons with disabilities. The Disability Convention furthers the human rights approach to disability and recognizes the right of people with disabilities to equality in most every aspect of life. It firmly endorses a social model of disability – a clear and direct repudiation of the medical model that traditionally was part-and-parcel of mental disability law. It calls for “respect for inherent dignity” and “non-discrimination.” Subsequent articles declare “freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,” “freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse,” and a right to protection of the “integrity of the person.”  In this paper, I consider the impact that the Convention is likely to have on sanism. First, I will briefly discuss both our sanist past and our sanist present. Then, I will consider how the CRPD has the greatest potential for combating sanism, and for changing social attitudes. In this latter inquiry, I will also draw on the tools of therapeutic jurisprudence. Then, I will offer some brief and modest conclusions.",,2013.0,84,14,1,True,,,,,,68,5303804,M.

The present study (N = 855) used an online survey to investigate Cass's (1984) theoretical model of stages of identity formation to explore shame and associated variables of internalized homophobia, ambivalence over emotional expression, and personal mastery across stages of identity development in order to clarify relationships among these variables. Findings offer partial support of Cass's stage model of sexual minority identity development as a process of differential stage progression and suggest that the relationships between shame, internalized homophobia, ambivalence over emotional expression and personal mastery are significant in understanding identity stage development.

71,Constructing Womanhood and the Female Cyborg: A Feminist Reading of Ex Machina and Westworld,"Female cyborgs have occupied the collective imagination since 1927’s iconic science fiction film Metropolis, reappearing in various popular films and television shows since Metropolis. Some feminist critics argue that depictions of female robots and cyborgs in earlier film and television reinforce sexist norms about female characters in film and television through imagining gendered robots and cyborgs in the form of an “ideal” female body and robots programmed by male scientists for their own purpose; others, however, argue that these same cyborg depictions disrupt traditional binaries of male/female and the biological/technological. How do more recent cinematic and televisual texts’ portrayals of female cyborgs extend or complicate these critiques, especially as the representational strategies of texts such as Ex Machina and Westworld draw from contemporary cultural anxieties about gender, labor, and technology reflected in popular narratives about “the end of men” or the displacements of an increasingly technologized American work force? Attending to the complex ways in which gender, race and sexuality are articulated in these recent fictional texts through a human/robot distinction they both reinscribe and unsettle, and drawing primarily from feminist film studies, cyborg studies, and feminist theory, I argue that Ex Machina’s and HBO’s Westworld’s female cyborgs ultimately re-purpose a trope that conventionally and ostensibly re-entrenches gender and racial norms toward a feminist critique of how U.S. popular culture generally negotiates the perceived promise and peril of new technologies through “old” technologies of race and gender.",,2017.0,86,1,0,False,,,,,,71,1406624391,Zoe E.

The chestburster scene is now stuff of legend and is iconic in the world of pop-culture and entertainment. Kevin Decker and Jeffery Ewing’s book, Alien and Philosophy: I Infest, Therefore I am, was also published in the spring, thirty eight years later, and not only does it also explore what it means to be human—and alien—but it does so in a way that both the movie and their book share: it is a form of entertainment. Of course, it is clear that Decker and Ewing’s purpose in Alien and Philosophy is not merely to entertain its readers, but to engage the reader in philosophizing while nevertheless ensuring that the entertainment factor is sufficiently met. In a rather gripping way Decker and Ewing explore topics as diverse as “identity and personhood, morality and the political and economic forces of the Alien universe, just war theory in going into battle against the Xenomorphs, the philosophy of horror, and feminist insights into Ripley’s leadership style”.",,2020.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,72,40654248,Jared A.

73,The stakeholders’ project in neuropsychological report writing: a survey of neuropsychologists’ and referral sources’ views of neuropsychological reports,"Abstract Objective: Though some neuropsychological groups have proposed criteria and suggestions for clinical report writing there has never been professional consensus or accepted published guidelines on how to write reports. Given the paucity of guidelines and the evolving practice climate, we sought to survey neuropsychologists and referral source stakeholders to understand current report writing practices. Method: The data were collected in two SurveyMonkey surveys via professional list servs, email, and LinkedIn clinical interest groups. Results: Results of the survey indicate many neuropsychologists spend multiple hours writing reports that they believe will not be read completely by stakeholders. A striking 73% of referral sources reported slow turnaround time of neuropsychological reports negatively affected their patient care. Referral sources reported they value the diagnosis/impression and recommendations sections the most; in contrast, they did not find the history, behavioral observations, emotional functioning, or descriptions of cognitive domains sections as useful. Conclusions: The survey findings highlight the disjuncture between what neuropsychologists typically do in their practice of report writing versus what they believe is useful for patients and referral sources. The survey also highlights differences between writing practices of neuropsychologists and what referral sources identify as the most valuable aspects of reports to assist them in caring for their patients.",Clinical Neuropsychologist,2018.0,34,21,3,True,The survey findings highlight the disjuncture between what neuropsychologists typically do in their practice of report writing versus what they believe is useful for patients and referral sources.,,,,,73,8396882,K.

74,Feminist Practice: Who I am or What I do?,"Abstract This article delves into a relatively neglected aspect of feminist, or anti-oppressive practice, namely that of practitioners’ experiences of this work, and specifically, their personal and professional identifications with feminism. It explores the question: is feminism, in the context of feminist practice, something one does, a professional “persona” adopted at particular times and for particular purposes at work, or something one is, transcending—or linking—the personal and professional realms? Drawing upon a qualitative, exploratory study, this article investigates understandings of, and identifications with, feminism within the context of an area of practice, namely domestic violence intervention, which is explicitly feminist. It focuses on the relationship of the research participants, practitioners in this field, to feminism in terms of their identification with feminist principles. Paying attention to these issues has implications for feminist and other anti-oppressive ways of working, particularly where these are adopted by organisations as the required model of practice. The broader question, that of whether one needs to—or “should”—be (or identify as) feminist in order to engage in feminist practice, while beyond the scope of the current study, is critical, both for feminist theorising in general and in relation to specific concerns such as professional education, development, and supervision.",,2012.0,54,8,2,False,,,"[{'title': 'tandfonline.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0312407X.2010.520088'}]","K Seymour - Australian Social Work, 2012 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'K Seymour', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3oe_nMYAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=3oe_nMYAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '3oe_nMYAAAAJ'}]",74,145080026,K.

Thirty years after the publication of Donna Haraway’s seminal ‘Cyborg Manifesto’, the female cyborg is still an assemblaged site of power disparity. Imprisoned at the intersection of affective labour, male desire and the weaponized female body, today’s iteration of the cyborg—the intelligent assistant that lives in our phone—is more virtual than organic, more sonic than tangible. Her design hinges on the patriarchal, profit-driven implementation of symbolic femininity, accompanied by an erasure of the female body as we know it, betraying the ways in which even incorporeal, supposedly ‘posthuman’ technologies fail to help us transcend the gendered power relations that continue to govern real human bodies.",,2016.0,49,25,3,False,,,,,,75,137649912,Hilary Bergen,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

These studies rarely offer theoretically based explanations for the increased weight, nor study the potential consequences (or lack thereof) of being heavier. This article provides a brief overview of the multitude of factors that might cause or contribute to larger size of sexual minority women, using an ecological framework that elucidates upstream social determinants of health as well as individual risk factors. This model is infused with a minority stress model, which hypothesizes excess strain resulting from the stigma associated with oppressed minority identities such as woman, lesbian, bisexual, woman of color, and others.

These cultural factors are looked at in the context of their sameness and difference from the adolescent’s parents. They often become fraught in relations at home and in the adolescent’s world of peers. Therefore, when adolescents are in treatment, it is almost inevitable that socio-cultural factors will enter the therapeutic relationship. The intensity that the adolescent brings to the work with regard to these issues is often mirrored by the intensity with which the therapist comes to feel a response. This clinical vignette and discussion is an effort to look at the complexities of the transference/counter-transference matrix that can arise when both members of the therapeutic dyad’s cultural selves come into play with this intensity.

86,What's the Score?: A Content Analysis of Mature Adults in Super Bowl Commercials,"ABSTRACT Based on the rising mature adult population (those aged 65+), the importance of advertisers recognizing this consumer group is imperative to businesses and consumers alike. Thus, this content analysis of 272 Super Bowl commercials, from the last 5 years (2010–2014), applied framing theory to examine how mature audiences are represented in one of the most expensive and highly viewed advertising venues. Previous research suggests that older adults are typically underrepresented in all media and often stereotyped. This study shows the opposite is true for recent Super Bowl commercials. Mature adults are prominently featured in nearly one-third (31.99%) of all ads analyzed—more than double their proportion in the general population and Super Bowl audience—and are framed most often in a positive light (80.49%). This indicates a promising shift from depictions that alienate to a more inclusive culture where mature adults are part of the media landscape and recognized as a key consumer base.

92,A Psychometric Review of Measures Assessing Discrimination Against Sexual Minorities,"ABSTRACT Discrimination against sexual minorities is widespread and has deleterious consequences on victims’ psychological and physical wellbeing. However, a review of the psychometric properties of instruments measuring lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) discrimination has not been conducted. The results of this review, which involved evaluating 162 articles, reveal that most have suboptimal psychometric properties. Specifically, myriad scales possess questionable content validity as (1) items are not created in collaboration with sexual minorities; (2) measures possess a small number of items and, thus, may not sufficiently represent the domain of interest; and (3) scales are “adapted” from measures designed to examine race- and gender-based discrimination. Additional limitations include (1) summed scores are computed, often in the absence of scale score reliability metrics; (2) summed scores operate from the questionable assumption that diverse forms of discrimination are necessarily interrelated; (3) the dimensionality of instruments presumed to consist of subscales is seldom tested; (4) tests of criterion-related validity are routinely omitted; and (5) formal tests of measures’ construct validity are seldom provided, necessitating that one infer validity based on the results obtained.

93,Intersectional stigma among midlife and older Black women living with HIV,"Abstract HIV-related stigma is a barrier to the prevention and treatment of HIV. For midlife and older Black women, the nature and intensity of HIV-related stigma may be compounded by their multiple marginalised social status based on gender, race, and age. We examined the perceptions and experiences of HIV-related stigma among midlife and older Black women living in Prince George’s County, Maryland, USA. Between 2014 and 2015, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of 35 midlife and older Black women living with HIV. Using a modified grounded theory approach, we explored emergent themes related to the manifestation and experience of intersectional stigma and changes in stigma experience over time. Our findings suggest that intersectional stigma is a central feature in midlife and older Black women’s lives, with women reporting experiences of intersectional stigma at the interpersonal/familial, community, and institutional/structural levels. Although women acknowledged gradual acceptance of their HIV-positive status over time, they continued to experience negative responses related to gender, race, age, and disease. Our findings indicate that a more robust understanding of the impact of HIV-related stigma requires work to consider the complex manifestations of intersectional stigma among an increasingly aging population of Black women in the USA.","Culture, Health and Sexuality",2017.0,63,67,4,True,It is suggested that a more robust understanding of the impact of HIV-related stigma requires work to consider the complex manifestations of intersectional stigma among an increasingly aging population of Black women in the USA.,,"[{'title': 'nih.gov', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5647221/'}]","T Sangaramoorthy, A Jamison, T Dyer - Culture, health & sexuality, 2017 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'T Sangaramoorthy', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VnZqElQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=VnZqElQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'VnZqElQAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'A Jamison', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IgG5S9cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=IgG5S9cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'IgG5S9cAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'T Dyer', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RvJ12HMAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=RvJ12HMAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'RvJ12HMAAAAJ'}]",93,4276355,T.

94,Association between workplace violence and burnout syndrome among schoolteachers: A systematic review,"Introduction: This review aimed to examine systematically the epidemiological evidence linking occupational exposure to violence with risk of burnout syndrome (BOS) among schoolteachers. Methods: A systematic review of literature used five primary databases: PsycINFO; Web of Science; PubMed Medline; Scopus; Cochrane; and keywords related to (a) workplace violence (WV), bullying, harassment, lateral violence, pupil misconduct, physical assault, teacher victimization; (b) schoolteachers, teachers, schools, pre-primary, kindergarten, primary, secondary; (c) burnout, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, to identify relevant articles. Articles included featured occupational violence and burnout among schoolteachers. Results of the studies were analysed qualitatively. Results: Of 1,472 peer-reviewed articles initially identified, 13 articles were included. All of them were published from 2005 to 2021 and had a quantitative approach. Type of violence against teachers ranged from workplace bullying or mobbing (n = 4), psychological violence (n = 4), to a combination of physical and psychological violence (n = 5). Most of the (verbal and physical) violence was perpetrated by students (n = 9). All grade and levels of schoolteachers were involved. In all cross-sectional studies (n = 10), WV was found to be correlated or associated with BOS (n = 5), the dimensions of EE and DP (n = 4) or the only dimension of EE (n = 2). Longitudinal studies showed that depersonalization was a significant predictor of workplace bullying (n = 1) and WV was indirectly a predictor of BOS (n = 2). Discussion and Conclusions: The reviewed studies consistently indicate an association between WV and BOS in schoolteachers. Further longitudinal studies are needed to provide most evidence on this relationship. There is need of legislative interventions for implementing mandatory occupational health programs and voluntary workplace health promotion programs. These solutions may protect and promote teachers’ mental well-being and give more education and emotional support to students and their families. Journal of Health and Social Sciences 2021; 6,2:187-208 The Italian Journal for Interdisciplinary Health and Social Development 188 INTRODUCTION Teaching is a highly demanding and stressful occupation [1]. Teacher stress has been defined as a teacher’s experience of unpleasant, negative emotions resulting from some aspects of their work [2]. Burnout syndrome (BOS) has been described in ICD-11 as an occupational syndrome resulting from poorly managed chronic workplace stress, which is characterized by emotional exhaustion (i.e. feelings of energy depletion), depersonalization or cynism (i.e. increased mental distance from one’s job or feelings of negativism or cynism related to one’s job), and reduced professional efficacy [3]. BOS has been described in a variety of human service professions [4– 6] and is considered an occupational hazard in helping professions [7] referred to a state of emotional, attitudinal and physical exhaustion that follows from a prolonged exposure to chronic stress [8–17]. However, many questions on BOS still remain unanswered. For instance, although there is a substantial overlap between BOS and depression [18], BOS should be better conceptualized as a breakdown in the relationship between workers and their work or clients [19]. Indeed, this syndrome is strictly related to occupational setting, and, therefore, BOS and depression should be considered two different concepts [20]. Furthermore, antecedents of work-related stress disorders and antecedents of BOS may be different [21]. Work-related stress is a risk factor that refers to aspects of the design and management of work and its social and organisational contexts that have the potential for causing psychological or physical harm [22], BOS has been described as a peculiar and distinctive psychosocial risk factor in helping professions including teachers, because it is closely associated with high emotional load and emotional demands [8, 23, 24]. According to the Job Demand Resources model [25, 26], occupational antecedents, also termed ‘stressors’ [25] or ‘job demands’ [26] of teacher burnout include job characteristics such as heavy workload, relationships with colleagues and management, poor working Competing interests none declared.

Further longitudinal studies are needed to explain this relationship.

On the opposite, positive relations with colleagues and the school administration as well as the feeling of doing a meaningful job are positive aspects of the job, termed as ‘job resources’, which may predict positive outcomes such as teacher motivation and well-being and prevent from the onset of teacher stress and burnout [29–32]. Workplace violence (WV) is another psycho-social risk factor, which is specifically regulated in European workplaces. WV can be physical, psychological and/or emotive, and people who are violent towards or harass an employee could be customers, clients, patients, students or pupils of this person [33]. Psychological and emotive violence can vary trough an ideal continuum in terms of intensity, frequency, and severity, ranging from workplace incivility o bullying, passing through lateral violence [34]. Lateral violence is a type of psychological harassment that can be isolated or sporadic and results in hostility. Psychological harassment include sexual harassment (unwanted sexual attention), verbal abuses, threats, humiliations, intimidations, criticism, innuendo, social and professional exclusion, discouragement, disinterest, and denied access to information [35]. Workplace bullying is a type of harassment described as an enduring offensive and insulting behavior, which is worsened by an intimidating, malicious, and insulting pattern [34, 36]. In Europe, bullying is usually termed as ‘mobbing’ [37] and occurs among peers, towards superiors or subordinates (vertical or hierarchical violence) [38, 39]. Bullying is a kind of deliberate and repetitive behavior able to affect negatively the health and economic wellness of the victim. Workplace incivility differs from (physical or verbal) WV for its ambiguity in the intent to damage the victim [40]. Teachers are exposed to physical (e.g., objects thrown, physical attacks, property damages), verbal (e.g., harassment, verbal threats) and social or relational (e.g., gossiping, refusing collaboration or sabotaging teacher’s work by using electronic devices and modern technology) violence, which is often perpetrated by students and their parents, or by colleagues as well [41, 42]. Scholars found a relationship between poor social interrelations with both pupils and colleagues or destructive friction within the professional community due to interpersonal conflicts and pupil misconduct, and an increased risk of developing BOS symptoms among schoolteachers [43–49]. A meta-analysis showed the existence of a relationship between pupils’ misconduct and teacher burnout [43]. Studies conducted in literature [50–53] showed that WV and BOS are associated in nurses and healthcare workers. Also, in teachers this relationship was found. Mościcka-Teske and colleagues  [54], for example, in an investigation that involved more than 1,200 teachers, showed that those who were victims of harassment or bullying were more prone to report burnout symptoms than non-victims. Geissler [55] found a correlation between victimization, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in this population. Similar data were found by Koga and colleagues [56] (verbal violence was associated with emotional exhaustion) and by Melanda and colleagues [57] (violence had a direct effect on emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). Likewise, teachers who regularly witness aggression also present a higher risk of emotional exhaustion although this might be less pronounced than their victimized colleagues [58, 59]. In addition, exposure to a globally high level of several types of aggression (combining witnessing and victimization) might impact teachers more severely than exposure to any specific type of aggression [58]. Physical assaults among education workers is a relevant problem worldwide, which is defined as being ‘hit, slapped, kicked, pushed, choked, grabbed, sexually assaulted, or otherwise subjected to physical contact intended to injure or harm’ [60]. Physical violence has a significant impact on teachers’ job satisfaction and health-related quality of life [61]. But, in general, school-related violence prediJournal of Health and Social Sciences 2021; 6,2:1",,2021.0,128,13,0,False,,,,,,94,3009320,F. Chirico,16236948,I. Capitanelli,1885234517,M.

95,Digital rhetoric and global literacies: Communication modes and digital practices in the networked world,"Insofar as algorithms are digital problem-solving operations that follow a set of rules or processes to arrive at a result, they are constrained by the rules that determine their parameters for operating. While an algorithm can only operate according to its instructions, however, the potential rules that might govern an algorithm are inexhaustible. An algorithm’s design thus makes rhetorical choices that privilege the importance of some information or desired outcomes over others. This chapter argues for a way of thinking about algorithmic rhetoric as macro-, meso-, and micro-rhetorical. Along these lines, it would be beneficial to think more about algorithms as digital rhetorics with terrific power to sway what counts as knowledge, truth, and material reality in the everyday lives of people across an astonishing range of global communities in the twenty-first century. THE QUINTESSENTIAL DIGITAL RHETORIC Suppose that, as I was typing this sentence, I’d misspelled the word “misspelled.” It wouldn’t much have mattered. No sooner would the wrong letters have materialized on my laptop’s screen than they would have morphed at once into the accepted, proper spelling. This phenomenon is called auto-correction, and it’s a common feature now of most all word processing software, from text messaging on a cell phone to plonking keys on a computer. Auto-correction—which fixes common spelling or grammatical errors when you type—and auto-completion—a related function that predicts the word or phrase you’re typing so to spare you the Herculean labor of having to type the rest yourself—are now commonplace on virtually all digital interfaces, whether conducting a web search, writing an email, or editing source code. These technologies are powered by algorithms: those often hidden sets of instructions that intervene in organizing our world in astonishing ways.

96,The abject single: exploring the gendered experience of singleness in Britain,"Abstract This paper explores the gendered experience of singleness in Britain through a theoretical and empirical understanding of the abject. Drawing on the writings of Judith Butler, we argue that singleness is culturally pathologised as an abject ‘other’, a liminal state which renders the legitimation of the single subject unintelligible. Through 14 active interviews with British singles, we demonstrate how our participants negotiate their marginal status vis-à-vis the marketplace and the broader society that continue to uphold heterosexual partnership as a normative form of intimacy. Our data uncovers persistent and powerful gender stereotypes of how singles ought to organise their lives and conform both to social, as well as market-driven pressures. We therefore highlight research gaps in the experience of singleness and critique the heteronormative framework that remains dominant, yet concealed, in gender research.",,2015.0,99,18,2,True,,,"[{'title': 'figshare.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://leicester.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/The_abject_single_exploring_the_gendered_experience_of_singleness_in_Britain/10153574/files/18298553.pdf'}]","AL Lai, M Lim, M Higgins - Journal of Marketing Management, 2015 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'M Higgins', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7elehCsAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=7elehCsAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '7elehCsAAAAJ'}]",96,118329802,Ai-Ling Lai,145236611,Ming Lim,144036832,M.

Women veterans are a population at high risk for IPV, yet the occurrence of lifetime and past-year IPV experiences by sexual orientation have not been examined in this population. Lifetime and past-year IPV experiences and current IPV-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed with validated screening measures as part of a 2014 web-based national survey of women veterans. Among 403 respondents, 9.7% (n = 39) identified as LBQ, and 90.3% (n = 364) identified as heterosexual. When controlling for age, LBQ-identified women veterans were significantly more likely to report lifetime sexual and physical IPV and lifetime intimate partner stalking. In the past year, LBQ-identified veterans were twice as likely to endorse emotional mistreatment and physical IPV, and three times more likely to endorse sexual IPV, than were heterosexual-identified women veterans. However, sexual orientation was unrelated to IPV-related PTSD symptoms, when controlling for age, race, and number IPV forms experienced.

online user base in the world, of which two-thirds is engaged in online gaming (Rapoza, 2014). To better understand the impact of online gaming on the society, this thesis examines how online gaming reconstructs consumer identities and gender relationship in this emerging economy. The first part of this thesis provides a comprehensive review of the recent development of the online game market as well as the transformation of identity and gender in contemporary Chinese society. The second part of this thesis investigates how online gaming culture, as a subset of popular culture, affects individuals’ everyday lives and socio-dynamics. This thesis critically analyzes the reconstruction of identity and gender relationships among the “digital youth”
population in Shanghai, mainland China. The findings highlight the embodiment and
disembodiment of digital selves in the online game context. The contribution of this thesis is threefold. First, this thesis provides a critical discussion on the reconstruction of identity, gender, and consumerism at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. Second, the findings of this study illustrate key factors that influence or mediate the construction of digital youth culture. Finally, this thesis provides insights to practitioners, marketing and consumer researchers, and policymakers regarding the positive and negative impacts of online gaming on the young generation in mainland China.",,2016.0,191,1,1,False,,,,,,98,2144064529,Xiaodong Yue,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,Review
99,Beyond Racial Divides: Ethnicities in Social Work Practice,"Written by leading authorities in the field, this challenging book addresses complex issues of ethnicity and racial discrimination in ways that encourage further debate and analysis. Its main theme is that social work has been and remains, deeply implicated in racist policies and practices that have been locality specific, but that racism is also recognizable across borders as a phenomenon that appears everywhere. At the same time, the book focuses on innovative theories and practice which seek to promote an emancipatory social work which sets itself the goal of eradicating social injustice – particularly that applying to ""race."" The contributors come from a wide range of countries and describe their experiences in tackling racism in social work at the levels of both theory and practice. This provides an impressive range of perspectives which cover models of social work created by people who have had to live with racism and find ways of overcoming it as well as those who have struggled to become able to express their own ethnicity without oppressing others. The concluding message of the book is a positive one – people can create a world that goes beyond racial divides by accepting, validating and celebrating diversity while at the same time recognizing that people share many commonalities with others which can be used to establish egalitarian relationships, realize social justice and communicate effectively with each other.",,2001.0,0,21,0,False,,,,,,99,52467891,L.

First, how do different personality characteristics-self-monitoring and the Big Five personality traits-relate to indegree centrality and brokerage, the two most studied structurally advantageous positions in organizational networks? Second, how do indegree centrality and brokerage compare in explaining job performance and career success? Third, how do these personality variables and network positions relate to work outcomes? Our results show that self-monitoring predicted indegree centrality across expressive and instrumental networks and brokerage in expressive networks after controlling for the Big Five traits. Self-monitoring, therefore, was especially relevant for understanding why people differ in their acquisition of advantageous positions in social networks. But the total variance explained by personality ranged between 3% and 5%. Surprisingly, we found that indegree centrality was more strongly related to job performance and career success than brokerage. We also found that personality predicted job performance and career success above and beyond network position and that network position partially mediated the effects of certain personality variables on work outcomes.

110,"Out of sight, out of mind: Exploring the mental health of Asian American lesbians","Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Exploring the Mental Health of Asian American Lesbians Melissa J. Halasan Corpus Lesbians of color exemplify persons with multiple, marginalized identities. Scholars theorize that they are susceptible to racist, heterosexist, and sexist discrimination. Given the multiple pathways of discrimination, scholars postulate that lesbians of color are susceptible to adverse mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorders, and decreased life satisfaction (Williams & Williams-Morris, 2000). However, most literature on lesbians of color and mental health is primarily theoretical or conceptual while empirical evidence is limited. Further, the scant literature on lesbians of color that exists primarily explore Black and/or Latina lesbians, while very little is know about the mental health of Asian American and Native American lesbians. The purpose of my research study was to explore how Asian American lesbians’ mental health is affected by the convergence of multiple societal oppressions such as racism, heterosexism, and sexism (N=167). Additionally, I explored how both enculturation and unsupportive social interactions among Asian American lesbians moderates the relationship between mental health and perceived experiences with racism, heterosexism, sexism. Perceived experiences with racist, heterosexist, and sexist events were each measured by Asian American Racism-Related Stress Inventory (AARRSI; Liang, Li, & Kim, 2004), Heterosexist Harassment, Rejection, and Discrimination Scale (HHRD; Szymanski, 2006), and Schedule of Sexist Events (SSE; Klonoff & Landrine, 1995), respectively. To measure each moderator, level of enculturation and unsupportive social interactions, the study utilized Asian Values Scale (AVS; Kim et al., 1999) and Unsupportive Social Interactions Inventory (USII; Ingram, Betz, et al., 2001), respectively. Lastly, mental health outcomes were measured by Mental Health Inventory (MHI; Veit & Ware, 1983). Correlation analysis and multiple regression analyses evaluated the relationship among these variables. Results indicated that heterosexist events uniquely predicted mental health, unsupportive social interactions were predictive of mental health, and unsupportive social interactions significantly moderated the relationship between perceived experiences with racism and mental health.

111,Co-Occurrence of and Recovery from Substance Abuse and Lifespan Victimization: A Qualitative Study of Female Residents in Trauma-Informed Sober Living Homes,"ABSTRACT Despite the co-occurrence of substance use disorders (SUDs) and domestic and/or sexual violence (DSV) in the lives of women, there remains a dearth of research on how and why these phenomena intersect as well as the role that trauma-informed sober living homes (SLHs) may play in promoting recovery. Following a detailed description of a unique trauma-informed SLH (Support, Education, Empowerment, and Directions [SEEDs]), we present findings from a qualitative study that documented the perceptions and lived experiences of 28 female current or former residents of a trauma-informed SLH; all women had histories of SUDs and DSV. Results uncovered four themes (fractured foundations, points of intersection of SUDs and DSV, pervasiveness of SUDS and DSV, resiliency) and a constitutive pattern (moving away from instability and harnessing self-agency). Women noted that their engagement with SEEDs played a significant role in their recovery, specifically through fulfilling their needs for tangible resources (e.g., food, clothing, shelter) and the community’s provision of emotional support (e.g., family, love, consistency) to promote recovery. These findings provide new insights on SUDs and DSV and preliminary support for the effectiveness of a trauma-informed SLH.",Journal of Psychoactive Drugs,2017.0,47,10,1,False,Findings from a qualitative study that documented the perceptions and lived experiences of 28 female current or former residents of a trauma-informed SLH provide new insights on SUDs and DSV and preliminary support for the effectiveness of a violence-informed sober living homes.,,,,,111,23076329,Katie M.

116,Validation Study of the Revised Version of the Scale of Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity in Brazil,"ABSTRACT In Brazil, there is a deficit of culturally adapted tools to assess prejudice against sexual and gender diversity with empirically demonstrable validity and reliability. Prejudice against non-heterosexual orientations is a strong problem within Brazilian culture and is particularly related to nonnormative expressions of gender. To address these issues, a scale was created. The objective of this article is to validate the revised version of this instrument developed for the specificities of Brazilian culture and establish its reliability. The revised version of Scale of Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity (PASGD) was completed by 8,184 undergraduate students from southern Brazil. Analysis was conducted using the item response theory (IRT) model for rating scale data, criterion validity, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale showed good validity and reliability.

The purpose of this study is to better understand internalized stigma—the experience of accepting and internalizing negative social messages and experiences about one's identity—an underexplored minority stressor for TGNC people. Method: We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 diverse TGNC participants using consensual qualitative research (CQR) methodology. Results: Following data saturation and analysis, six distinct themes emerged across participants: (1) TGNC identities are regarded negatively by society; (2) social messages are perceived as originating from the media and religious ideology; (3) TGNC individuals report emotional distress; (4) negative self-perceptions in response to social messages; (5) TGNC individuals report resilience processes in response to negative social messages; and (6) social messages are perceived generally to differentially impact TGNC people of color.

127,"Individual and Systemic Barriers to Health Care: Perspectives of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Adults","Access to effective services is imperative to address the many health and mental health disparities that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people face. This population, however, remains underserved and often ill-served in health care environments. Furthermore, interactions between system- and individual-level dimensions of access create barriers to service engagement. Within much of the extant literature surrounding health care barriers among LGBT people, the rich narratives and varied experiences of LGBT community members from diverse backgrounds have often been excluded. The current interview-based study was conducted with a sample of 40 self-identified LGBT adults living in New York City. Participants were recruited through flyers distributed to LGBT-specific social and health service organizations. Twenty-nine participants who discussed health care access as a major health concern were included in the current study. Framework analysis revealed barriers stemming from characteristics of services and providers (system-level) and characteristics of care-seekers (individual-level) as major health concerns. The root causes of system-level barriers were all attributed to social-structural factors that worked to exclude and erase LGBT people from the institutions that shape the health and mental health systems. Individual-level barriers were attributed to both individual and social-structural factors, such as health literacy and stigma. Participants linked access barriers to forgone care and to other health and mental health concerns within their communities.

133,Understanding and Measuring LGBTQ Pathways to Health: A Scoping Review of Strengths-Based Health Promotion Approaches in LGBTQ Health Research,"ABSTRACT Health research traditionally has focused on the health risks and deficits of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) populations, obscuring the determinants that can promote health across the life course. Recognizing, appropriately measuring, and rendering visible these determinants of health is paramount to informing appropriate and engaging health policies, services, and systems for LGBTQ populations. The overarching purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the findings of a scoping review aimed at exploring strengths-based health promotion approaches to understanding and measuring LGBTQ health. Specifically, this scoping review examined peer-reviewed, published academic literature to determine (a) existing methodological frameworks for studying LGBTQ health from a strengths-based health promotion approach, and (b) suggestions for future methodological approaches for studying LGBTQ health from a strengths-based health promotion approach. The findings of this scoping review will be used to inform the development of a study aimed at assessing the health of and improving pathways to health services among LGBTQ populations in Nova Scotia, Canada.",Journal of Homosexuality,2017.0,143,60,1,False,"The findings of this scoping review will be used to inform the development of a study aimed at assessing the health of and improving pathways to health services among LGBTQ populations in Nova Scotia, Canada.",,,,,133,145441617,J.

134,Anna Banti Stages Artemisia Gentileschi: Feminist Intersections of Painting and Theater,"Author(s): Streifer, Monica L | Abstract: This article explores how Anna Banti recasts Artemisia Gentileschi on the modern Italian stage. In her only dramatic work, Corte Savella (1960), Banti harnesses the aesthetic power of Gentileschi's paintings to influence both the characters within the play and her twentieth-century audience beyond the fourth wall. By using Gentileschi’s paintings to drive her play thematically, aesthetically, and as a plot device, Banti provides a new interpretation of Gentileschi's artistic oeuvre, which prior to the early twentieth century had been largely dismissed. I argue that the way in which Banti interweaves Gentileschi’s paintings with the unfolding the play provides a unique platform for a pioneering reinterpretation of her artistic corpus from a feminist perspective, as well as new ways of understanding the intermedial intersections of visual and performing arts.",,2017.0,0,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'escholarship.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://escholarship.org/content/qt9w95s8jq/qt9w95s8jq.pdf'}]","ML Streifer - California Italian Studies, 2017 - escholarship.org",,134,112948350,M.

135,"Heterosexism, Depression, and Campus Engagement Among LGBTQ College Students: Intersectional Differences and Opportunities for Healing","ABSTRACT LGBTQ people experience health disparities related to multilevel processes of sexual and gender marginalization, and intersections with racism can compound these challenges for LGBTQ people of color. Although community engagement may be protective for mental health broadly and for LGBTQ communities in buffering against heterosexism, little research has been conducted on the racialized dynamics of these processes among LGBTQ communities. This study analyzes cross-sectional survey data collected among a diverse sample of LGBTQ college students (n = 460), which was split by racial status. Linear regression models were used to test main effects of interpersonal heterosexism and engagement with campus organizations on depression, as well as moderating effects of campus engagement. For White LGBTQ students, engaging in student leadership appears to weaken the heterosexism–depression link—specifically, the experience of interpersonal microaggressions. For LGBTQ students of color, engaging in LGBTQ-specific spaces can strengthen the association between sexual orientation victimization and depression.",Journal of Homosexuality,2017.0,59,74,3,False,"This study analyzes cross-sectional survey data collected among a diverse sample of LGBTQ college students to test main effects of interpersonal heterosexism and engagement with campus organizations on depression, as well as moderating effects of campus engagement.",,,,,135,4847401,A.

137,Beyond Abortion: The Consequences of Overturning Roe,"Abstract The upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization has the potential to eliminate or severely restrict access to legal abortion care in the United States. We address the impact that the decision could have on abortion access and its consequences beyond abortion care. We posit that an abortion ban would, in effect, mean that anyone who becomes pregnant, including those who continue a pregnancy and give birth to healthy newborns and those with pregnancy complications or adverse pregnancy outcomes will become newly vulnerable to legal surveillance, civil detentions, forced interventions, and criminal prosecution. The harms imposed by banning or severely restricting abortion access will disproportionately affect persons of color and perpetuate structural racism. We caution that focusing on Roe as a decision that only protects ending a pregnancy ignores the protection that the decision also affords people who want to continue their pregnancies. It overlooks the ways in which overturning Roe will curtail fundamental rights for all those who become pregnant and will undermine their status as full persons meriting Constitutional protections. Such a singular focus inevitably obscures the common ground that people across the ideological spectrum might inhabit to ensure the safety, health, humanity, and rights of all people who experience pregnancy.",American Journal of Bioethics,2022.0,139,27,1,True,"It is posit that an abortion ban would mean that anyone who becomes pregnant, including those who continue a pregnancy and give birth to healthy newborns and those with pregnancy complications or adverse pregnancy outcomes will become newly vulnerable to legal surveillance, civil detentions, forced interventions, and criminal prosecution.",,,,,137,10123044,L.

140,Serus: Continue to Bootstrap or Seek VC Funding?,"Introduction It was 7pm on a warm and sunny Friday evening in Mountain View, California. Unaware of the glorious weather outdoors, Indu Navar and Barbara Hoefle were huddled together in the office, deep in discussion about the future of their company, which had reached a crucial crossroad. Indu reminisced about the early days of the business when they had focused on market validation, and when every sale was a huge achievement in reducing the burden on their personal finances. Now, there was a new challenge facing the company. Three years after founding Serus Corporation, the two women wondered whether or not to continue with their strategy of bootstrapping the company with some support from angel investors. Or was it time to approach venture capitalists (VCs) to help grow the company at a faster pace? The two co-founders of Serus Corporation, a company providing supply chain management software solutions for global clients, had self-funded or 'bootstrapped' the initial stage of their start-up. They had used their experience to grow Serus with minimal external funding. Serus' sales revenues had grown steadily since start-up, as global companies continued to buy and install software applications to improve their transportation, warehousing, and distribution operations. However, Indu anticipated that sales revenues would soon reach a plateau unless the company accelerated its business development, marketing, and sales efforts. If the VCs invested, they could bring in millions of dollars into the company that could help to fund the development efforts, and attract new customers and employees. But Indu knew that this was not just about the money. If the VCs invested, she and Barbara would no longer have complete control over Serus. Was it worth ceding control to grow the company? Involving VCs would also go against Indu's principles of self-funding her venture. Besides, would the company's growth prospects necessarily improve with VC funding? Some of their VC-backed competitors had already closed down. Would Serus end up the same way? These were some of the many questions that Indu asked herself. She knew she had to make a decision quickly. She wanted to build a strong company with a core ideology that was ""built to last"" (in the words of Jim Collins in his book with the same title) and that would make a lasting impact on the enterprise software industry. The Founders Born into a family of entrepreneurs who were technologists, Indu Navar, one of the two founders of Serus Corporation, always had a passion for finding solutions to complex problems. Just like her father, who was an entrepreneur and also her role model, she had always wanted to start her own company. After completing a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Bangalore University in India, Indu came to the US to pursue a Masters degree in Computer Science at California State University, Chico, and went on to work at NASA, Silicon Graphics, and Healtheon (WebMD). She was one of the initial team of engineers for WebMD, which was her first experience of working in a new venture. In February 1999, Indu met Barbara Hoefle, who was then employed at UPS and had over 15 years of experience in the supply chain, logistics, and manufacturing market. Indu, who had recently quit her job at WebMD to explore new opportunities, approached Barbara with a business plan and the two women arranged to meet. Barbara was not impressed by the business plan, but at their meeting she ""quickly assessed that Indu had all the qualities of being a successful entrepreneur...Indu came across as a brilliant technologist, who had a clear understanding of business problems and their challenges."" Thirty days later, Indu approached Barbara again to brainstorm some new business ideas. Indu felt she had found the right partner in Barbara, whose extensive supply chain experience and excellent customer skills complemented her own background in software. …",,2009.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,140,46631960,A.

141,Nonchildhood Sexual Abuse in Mexican American and Mexican College Students,"ABSTRACT This study aimed to assess and compare sexual abuse (SA) rates in female and male Mexican American college students (N = 514) and 2 samples of Mexican college students (N = 161 and N = 227). Participants responded to the Sexual Experiences Survey Victim Form (SES-SFV). SA prevalence and frequency rates were compared between sample groups for 3 categories of SA: nonchildhood SA (SA-NC, experienced since age 14), SA experienced in the previous 12 months (SA-12M), and lifetime self-labeled SA (SA-LL, any experience identified as abuse or rape by participants). Higher rates of self-reported SA were consistently found for Mexican versus U.S. samples. However, SA incidence was also consistently higher in older individuals and females; more recently experienced SA was reported at lower rates and with greater gender congruence than more distal SA; and variation between Mexican samples was roughly equal to variation between Mexican and U.S. samples. Findings show cross-national variation in SA rates.",,2017.0,59,2,0,False,,,,,,141,4243403,D. L. Rogers,1656687121,Martha L. Calderón Galassi,144860410,Joanna C. Espinosa,5280553,Amy A.

143,The Politics of Plasticity. Sex and Gender in the 21st Century Brain,"The Politics of Plasticity examines how sex and gender are imag(in)ed in the 21st century brain. At the beginning of this century, the idea that the brain is plastic (i.e. that its structure and function change throughout life) began to replace the idea that adult brains are fixed. The claim that sex differences are hardwired into the brain, however, is still frequently endorsed. Building on feminist critiques of this claim, this dissertation argues that plasticity offers a critical alternative perspective on how sex/gender comes to matter in the brain – a perspective that takes into account both discursive formation and bodily materiality. This study also investigates to what extent plasticity has already been incorporated into scientific, political and popular representations of sex/gender and the brain, and to what extent these representations subvert, transform and/or preserve familiar gender norms. Examples from education, parenting, and mental healthcare demonstrate that in the 21st century brain, plasticity is generally recognized as a property of male and female brains. Brain sex itself, however, continues to be seen as a natural essence that remains fixed throughout life. This fusion of determinism and plasticity, it is argued in this thesis, gives rise to a neoliberal, post-feminist subject who is bound by her sex, yet free (responsible, even) to pursue her supposedly limitless potential. The analysis presented here suggests that (re)thinking the sexed/gendered subject as a neuroplastic subject might foster norms, values and subjectivities that are antithetical to a critical feminist perspective.",,2016.0,663,3,1,False,,,,,,143,5228039,A.

145,Self-definition as resistance: Understanding identities among LGBTQ emerging adults,"ABSTRACT Scholars have questioned the relevance of existing identity categories and labels for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth and emerging adults. Little is understood, however, about the ways in which LGBTQ emerging adults perceive their own identities and self-define the aspects of themselves that are most relevant to who they are. This study qualitatively explored descriptions and depictions of identities and aspects of self among a group of LGBTQ-identified emerging adults. Findings suggest that emerging adults' uses of socially constructed identities are contextually specific, intersectional, and make use of agency. In addition, participants identified aspects of themselves that they saw as emerging from and existing in relation to their LGBTQ-specific identities. These identities are used to resist the social stigma and limitations placed on them as LGBTQ-identified young people, and may serve as sources of resilience.",,2016.0,38,26,3,False,,,,"MA Wagaman - Journal of LGBT Youth, 2016 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'MA Wagaman', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LgTCGnwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=LgTCGnwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'LgTCGnwAAAAJ'}]",145,144670777,M.

147,Emotional Dependency and Dysfunctional Relationship Beliefs as Predictors of Married Turkish Individuals’ Relationship Satisfaction,"Abstract In this study, we examined married individuals’ relationship satisfaction in relation to their emotional dependency and dysfunctional relationship beliefs. Our participants consisted of 203 female and 181 male, a total of 384 married individuals from urban cities of Turkey. Controlling the effects of gender and length of marriage, we performed a hierarchical regression analysis. Results revealed that married Turkish individuals’ relationship satisfaction was significantly explained by their emotional dependency (sr 2 = .300, p < .001), and perceptions of interpersonal rejection (sr 2 = .075, p < .001) and unrealistic relationship expectations (sr 2 = .028, p < .001). However, interpersonal misperception did not make a significant contribution to the participants’ relationship satisfaction (p > .05). When compared to perceptions of interpersonal rejection and unrealistic relationship expectations, emotional dependency had the largest role in explaining participants’ satisfaction with their marriages. We discuss the results in light of current literature as well as cultural relevance. We also provide implications for future research and mental health practices.",The Spanish Journal of Psychology,2016.0,56,9,0,False,"When compared to perceptions of interpersonal rejection and unrealistic relationship expectations, emotional dependency had the largest role in explaining participants’ satisfaction with their marriages.",,,,,147,8537827,Gülşah Kemer,1405408121,Evrim Çetinkaya Yıldız,48051779,G.

153,Evaluating a gender diversity workshop to promote positive learning environments,"ABSTRACT Drawing on data from an Aotearoa/New Zealand study of more than 230 secondary students, this article evaluates the potential of a 60-min gender diversity workshop to address bullying and promote positive environments for learning. Students completed pre- and postworkshop questionnaires. The authors used descriptive statistics to summarize results and conducted t-tests to assess the statistical significance of changes from before the workshop to immediately after the workshop. The authors used thematic analysis to analyze open-ended questionnaire responses. In summary, 237 students (M age = 13.7 years) attending 10 workshops participated in the study. More than 80% of students thought the gender diversity workshop would reduce bullying in schools, and 94% of participants reported that they would recommend the workshop to other young people. There was a significant increase in valuing (p < .001) and understanding (p < .001) gender-diverse people before and after the workshop. School cultures were largely perceived to be hard for gender-diverse students; however, many respondents reported a desire to be supportive of their gender-diverse peers. Reducing bullying related to gender identity and expression is very likely to have a positive effect on the mental health and educational achievement of young people. Brief diversity workshops, as a part of a wider suite of educational reforms, have the potential to create safer environments for learning.",,2017.0,64,21,2,True,,,"[{'title': 'open.ac.uk', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'http://oro.open.ac.uk/48425/3/Burford%2C%20Lucassen%20and%20Hamilton%20%282017%29_Accepted%20paper.pdf'}]","J Burford, MFG Lucassen, T Hamilton - Journal of LGBT Youth, 2017 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'J Burford', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WW4nycoAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=WW4nycoAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'WW4nycoAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'MFG Lucassen', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=REorB-oAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=REorB-oAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'REorB-oAAAAJ'}]",153,5860487,James Burford,40600683,Mathijs F.

154,When compliments fail to flatter: American individualism and responses to positive stereotypes.,"Five studies show that being the target of a positive stereotype is a negative interpersonal experience for those from individualistic cultures because positive stereotypes interfere with their desire to be seen as individuals separate from their groups. U.S.-born Asian Americans and women who heard a positive stereotype about their group in an intergroup interaction (e.g., ""Asians are good at math,"" ""women are nurturing"") derogated their partner and experienced greater negative emotions than those who heard no stereotype. Negative reactions were mediated by a sense of being depersonalized, or ""lumped together"" with others in one's group, by the positive stereotype (Studies 1-3). Cross-cultural differences (Study 4) and an experimental manipulation of cultural self-construal (Study 5) demonstrated that those with an independent self-construal reacted more negatively to positive stereotypes than those with an interdependent self-construal. By bringing together research on stereotypes from the target's perspective with research on culture, this work demonstrates how cultural self-construals inform the way people interpret and respond to being the target of positive stereotypes.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2013.0,108,108,10,False,"How cultural self-construals inform the way people interpret and respond to being the target of positive stereotypes is demonstrated, by bringing together research on stereotypes from the target's perspective with research on culture.",,"[{'title': 'washington.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'http://depts.washington.edu/sibl/Publications/Siy%20&%20Cheryan%202013.pdf'}]","JO Siy, S Cheryan - Journal of personality and social psychology, 2013 - psycnet.apa.org","[{'name': 'S Cheryan', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JmWiiRAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=JmWiiRAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'JmWiiRAAAAAJ'}]",154,3908059,John Oliver Siy,2325780,Sapna Cheryan,,,,,,,,,"Psychology, Medicine","JournalArticle, Study"

156,How racial cues affect support for American racial hierarchy among African Americans and Whites,"Though racial hierarchy has been critical to American political development and continues to color much of American politics, little is known about the extent to which political factors mitigate or exacerbate support for the racial status quo. Using insights gained from research on system justification and racial priming, this paper examines how the use of negative racial cues by political elites affects support for American racial hierarchy among African Americans and Whites, where racial hierarchy is assessed both explicitly (with survey items) and implicitly (with the Implicit Association Test). Results from two original experiments suggest that the effect of elite racial cues on support for racial hierarchy is moderated by political ideology, and the strength and direction of the effects varies by racial group and the type of support for racial hierarchy – explicit or implicit – being examined.",,2014.0,45,2,0,False,,,,"ML Lyle - Politics, Groups, and Identities, 2014 - Taylor & Francis",,156,14618602,Monique L.

The present study explores key themes structuring this discussion. Popular online news aggregators were searched using the keywords fat, obese, and obesity. Fifty-nine articles and their comments were subjected to qualitative thematic analysis. Three thematic areas characterized the current discourse: concern, blame, and advice. Findings show how concerns about fat shaming are coming to be constructed as part of a dilemma in which concerns for the psychological well-being of fat people are set against the need to address the (putative) physical “harms” of “obesity.”",,2017.0,43,19,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'utas.edu.au', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'http://ecite.utas.edu.au/135203/1/135203'}]","P Cain, N Donaghue, G Ditchburn - Fat Studies, 2017 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'N Donaghue', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0cJ8Q3EAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0cJ8Q3EAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '0cJ8Q3EAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'G Ditchburn', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LR7dX30AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=LR7dX30AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'LR7dX30AAAAJ'}]",158,1484668738,Patricia Cain,5197397,N.

Transgender clients report experiencing discrimination and differential treatment by health care providers in clinical settings. This pilot study assessed prelicensure nursing students' attitudes, beliefs, and willingness to provide care for transgender individuals.


METHOD
Participants enrolled in an adult health nursing course were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire, the Transgender Attitudes and Beliefs Survey, and a Willingness to Provide Clinical Care questionnaire.


RESULTS
Almost all of the participants reported positive attitudes toward transgender clients. Almost all of the participants reported a willingness to provide nursing skills; one participant was unwilling to perform genital or anal-related care.


CONCLUSION
The majority of the prelicensure nursing students in this pilot study indicated they were willing to provide nursing care for transgender clients. More research is needed to assess prelicensure nursing students' learning needs regarding the provision of nursing care for transgender individuals.

166,"Automation, Work, and Ideology: The Next Industrial Revolution and the Transformation of ""Labor""","and Concrete Labor Capitalist society is characterized by how it makes individual reproduction and society’s reproduction dependent upon the interdependent labor of workers in a division of labor that now spans the globe. At the core of this interdependence is the unique socially mediating function labor takes in capitalism. Trenkle (1998b) notes how the nature of labor in capitalist society is dependent upon its social context to derive meaning (pg. 1). Labor in capitalism is only considered labor if it “materializes in the abstract-social context of the production of commodities and some wage is awarded for the carrying out” (Trenkle, 1998b, pg. 1). What Marx calls abstract labor refers to when selling labor power for a certain amount of time in 93 Of course, there are kinds of work that exist “outside” of what capitalism considers labor, because what counts as labor in capitalism is labor time expenditure in exchange for the universal equivalent, money. The most common example of labor “outside” of capitalism is unpaid domestic labor, which is crucial for social reproduction but nonetheless does not count as labor for capital. See, Scholz, (2009) Patriarchy and Commodity Society: Gender without the Body. 186 exchange for a wage that can be used to exchange for commodities is the primary means of social reproduction that is made general across the whole of society. When this system is generalized, labor takes on an abstract socially mediating character it did not have in previous forms of social life. Regardless of what concrete form labor takes, be it productive labor, service labor, agricultural labor or intellectual labor, the labor has an abstract character because it is remunerated not based on its concrete quality, but by a quantitative measurement of time. Only when capitalism is generalized does remunerated labor time become viewed as a universally valid form of exchange for the products of others. Ultimately, in modern society it is viewed as “natural” that all human beings must to work to survive, but this obscures how this “need” to work is socially created and enforced because of the structuring power of a society where social reproduction is dependent upon acquiring value through labor.",,2017.0,190,3,0,False,,,,,,166,2140678874,Anthony J.

Inspired by ‘social realist’ thinking, a body of work has emerged that criticises the dominance of generic and process-based thinking about (especially) professional education and advocates instead a revaluation of discipline-based and theoretical knowledge. In this paper, I discuss the role of the concept of expertise in professional education. Following Winch, I situate the dominant theories of expertise in the field today as ‘fluency’ accounts of expertise – such theories focus more on the fluency or automaticity with which the expert acts than on the content of what the expert can do. As an alternative, I investigate Collins and Evans’s recent work on expertise in the sociology of scientific knowledge. Similar to what Collins and Evans suggests for science studies, I hold that education would benefit from consideration of the developing ‘third wave’ of thinking about the nature of expertise and I sketch the main features of a social realist view of the nature of expertise for professional education.",,2014.0,34,31,4,False,,,,"B Kotzee - Journal of Education and Work, 2014 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'B Kotzee', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5QTf0WgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=5QTf0WgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '5QTf0WgAAAAJ'}]",170,9534342,Ben Kotzee,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

Although these approaches are certainly valid, they often ignore how these behaviours are embedded in the culture and, as a result, do not adequately explore the causes and consequences of sexual violence perpetration. Therefore, the primary goal of this review is to redress this deficiency, focusing on the connection between the phenomenon and the cultural backdrop against which it occurs. Hence, a discussion around certain factors that may serve to either legitimise or to condemn sexual violence in two different countries (Brazil and UK) is necessary. To make this possible, differences regarding each country’s culture, rape legislation and prevalence are presented, and issues regarding the current individualistic theoretical approach to the subject are explored.",,2017.0,104,22,0,True,,,,,,173,118471432,Arielle Sagrillo Scarpati,3798250,Afroditi Pina,,,,,,,,,Psychology,Review

177,"A Review of “Silverstein, M. L. (2013). Personality assessment in depth: A casebook.”","In the many symposia on teaching and supervising personality assessment held at the convention of the Society for Personality Assessment, a common lament is the lack of time to address the interpretation and integration of psychological data. It seems that addressing administrative and coding issues absorbs the bulk of academic time. Yet, putting the pieces together to create a portrait of a human being is a challenging task of the highest order. Personality Assessment in Depth: A Casebook by Marshall L. Silverstein teaches us how to do so. Dr. Silverstein, professor of psychology at Long Island University, has contributed to the literature two prior books on personality assessment, Self Psychology and Diagnostic Assessment (1999), and Disorders of the Self (2007). In this text, his cases offer a meticulous, detailed, even luxurious exploration of the multiple meanings of the great fund of data available to the personality assessor. Silverstein unstintingly plumbs the structural and content aspects of responses, test-taking behaviors, and extratest behaviors (e.g., the client’s demeanor when scheduling testing sessions)—both in isolation and in relation to one another. Through his thorough exploration of the nuances and hues of words and images, he deftly accomplishes a main purpose in writing this book—to give content its due in the interpretive process. The initial chapter (“Empirically Based and Content-Based Clinical Interpretation”), which has a historical character, outlines the views that have been put forth by major scholars in personality assessment on the problem of how nomothetic and ideographic approaches to interpreting test data can be combined. Silverstein’s history of approaches centers on the Rorschach because among the many instruments used by the assessor, this method provides the greatest integrative challenge to the assessor aiming to interpret all aspects of the data. This history is a helpful refresher for seasoned professionals already familiar with the works of seminal contributors to the conversation about assessors’ methods of developing hypotheses from different types of Rorschach data. For students, however, a chapter organized by ideas on the matter with the writings of historical figures used by way of examples might have been more instructive. Ensuing chapters each provide an extensive case illustration. Each chapter revolves around a particular issue, the broad lines of which are laid out in the beginning of the chapter. This useful framing of the chapter is followed by a history, which varies in extensiveness. In some cases (e.g., the case description in Chapter 2), the reader is likely to long for more details on the client’s everyday functioning, both to get a fuller picture of the person and to see how this information does or does not jive with the personality data. Silverstein then interprets the data yielded by his chosen assessment instruments. He begins his trip through the data with whatever broadband selfreport instrument—Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory–III, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–A, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2—he administered. He then focuses on Human Figure Drawings, which provide a rich interpretive yield in large part because of his masterful questioning of the client about the drawings. Proceeding to the Rorschach next, Silverstein bravely interprets the protocols through the lens of both the Comprehensive System (CS) and Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R–PAS). Brave is an appropriate descriptor because Silverstein admits that he, like most personality assessors, is relatively new to the R–PAS. Yet, he approached the incorporation of these data with assiduity, securing the assistance of Robert Erard, one of the system’s originators. Silverstein also enlisted the help of Irving Weiner with difficult CS scoring calls—a good lesson for students that we all benefit from consultation! The result of these exertions is that the reader has a much-needed opportunity to see these systems side by side, the learning from which is enhanced by Silverstein’s own comparisons of the similarities and differences between the two systems for each of the cases. Following this structural analysis, Silverstein proceeds response by response through the protocol, excavating the content for the array of meanings they hold, a style akin to Schafer’s fine-grained content analysis. Silverstein then uses the same indepth approach for the Thematic Apperception Test responses. Each case illustration ends with a discussion in which the findings from the empirically based instruments are synthesized followed by an analysis of thematic content across the assessment methods. Silverstein’s first case (Chapter 2, “Personality Problems Associated With Affect Dysregulation”) of a 30-year-old African American divorced single mother, Ms. A., offers an extremely helpful exploration of the problem of subsyndromal disorders, disorders that can be as incapacitating as those meeting the syndrome threshold. Yet, their subtlety often dooms their bearer to a history of inadequate, misdirected, or completely absent treatment. This problem, of course, is a factor motivating many nosologists to advocate for dimensional criteria for psychopathology. In this case, the problem under consideration was an elusive type of affective dysregulation. To get a flavor of Silverstein’s style of analysis, consider the following comment on the client’s description of the female she drew as having wisdom:",,2014.0,3,0,0,False,,,,,,177,47913665,V.

By drawing on these disparate groups, located in disparate sites, this thesis traces connections but also disconnections as it analyses the 'friction' between the technical problem-solving of researchers and the organized activist politics of disabled people. It investigates the rationales of robot research, messy and multiple, as well as the material and political impetus behind the 'barrier free' movement for independent living. Social robots hold a special interest in Japan because not only do many people, both inside and outside of Japan, believe that the nation has a unique cultural interest and affinity for robots, but, with an ageing population, the Japanese state has looked toward social robots as potential care-givers and as a solution to the 'demographic crisis'. Through the engagement of both science and technology studies and disability studies, this thesis focuses on the theme of problems to show how the problem-making approach of robotics researchers, which identifies problems of the body as a disability to be solved by a technical fix in the form of a robot, contrasts with the perspective from disabled people themselves, who see disability as a problem of society and the environment rather than the individual and the body.",,2014.0,209,1,0,False,,,,,,179,117852756,Michael Berthin,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
180,Sexual Orientation Microaggressions on Campus: Prevalence and Outcomes among Lesbian/Gay and Bisexual Students,"Microaggressions are subtle, often-unintentional forms of discrimination that convey negative messages about targeted individuals. While empirical attention to sexual orientation microaggressions is growing, little is known about their prevalence among specific groups of sexual minorities. Using data (n = 438) from the US-based National Study of LGBTQ Student Success, this study examines: (1) the prevalence of both general sexual orientation microaggressions and erasure of sexuality and hypersexualization microaggressions among bisexual college students and their gay/lesbian peers; (2) the relationship between each type of microaggression and sexual orientation on student outcomes (depression, substance use, and social acceptance); (3) the role of gender in prevalence rates of microaggressions and the microaggression-sexuality-outcome relationship. Results indicate that gay/lesbian and bisexual students experience both forms of microaggressions at similar rates, and general microaggressions, and erasure and hypersexualization microaggressions increased gay/lesbian students’ risk for substance use and lower perceptions of social acceptance.",,2016.0,85,1,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'wlu.ca', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2955&context=etd'}]",P Sariyannis - 2016 - scholars.wlu.ca,,180,1456930544,Pamela Sariyannis Ms.,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
181,"Ethnic Discrimination and Psychological Distress among Middle Eastern/Arab Americans: The Roles of Religiosity, Coping, Ethnic Identity, and Family Connectedness","Despite increased public attention in the past decade towards the Middle East and Arab world, only a small but growing body of research literature investigating the mental health of individuals with ethnic background originating in these countries exists. Given the major stigma associated with being Middle Eastern/Arab (MEA) in the United States, the mental health-related implications for MEA Americans is of particular interest in the present study. Specifically, we investigated (1) the moderating role of religiosity in the link between religious affiliation and ethnic discrimination and (2) potential mediators (coping via internalization, detachment, and drugs/alcohol) and moderators (ethnic identity and family connectedness) in the relationship between ethnic discrimination and psychological distress among 122 MEA Americans. We found that Muslim identification predicted ethnic discrimination for MEAs with high but not low religiosity. In addition, higher levels of ethnic discrimination and more coping with discrimination via internalization, detachment, and drugs and alcohol were uniquely related to higher levels of psychological distress. Finally, family connectedness buffered the link between discrimination and coping via internalization.

182,"‘A lot more to learn than where babies come from’: controversy, language and agenda setting in the framing of school-based sexuality education curricula in Australia","Sexuality education in Australian schools continues to struggle in its ability and willingness to address many of the broader social issues associated with sexuality, such as the needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, intersex and queer (GLBTIQ) students. Studies involving teachers have demonstrated that a reticence on their part to teach GLBTIQ-inclusive sexuality education is driven by a lack of training in handling ‘sensitive’ issues, a fear of backlash and confusion over their obligations under relevant departmental policies. This reticence may, in part at least, stem from a commonly held inference that the inclusion of queer sexualities is inherently ‘controversial’. There appears to be a tendency for curricula and government directives to ‘juggle’ principles of social justice for marginalised sexualities with ‘risk management’ policies, which seek to screen course content for potential ‘controversy’. Much of this controversy has its roots in the language and rhetoric used to describe and discuss issues dealt with in sexuality education curricula. The paper demonstrates, through the process of ‘languaging’, how the language and rhetoric of controversy and sexuality can be exposed so that they may be better addressed through policy and government directives.",,2015.0,58,46,3,False,,,,,,182,114129540,Barrie Shannon,49742782,Stephen Smith,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

In order to gain insights what this impact might entail, this thesis will work out how the development of robots and Science-Fiction are entwined. This will be continued by an exposition of the current uncertainties in the discussion on robot-ethics. To find answers on these uncertainties, this thesis will conduct four explorative analyses. These analyses will focus on the development of human-robot relations as depicted in a selection of Science-Fiction movies. In order to conduct these analyses the framework on the Roboethcis of appearance & Roboethics of good and experience/imagination as composed by Coeckelbergh (2009) will be used, this framework focusses mainly on alterity relations. These alterity relations are in turn based on the distinction, machine and “quasi-other” made by Ihde (1990). This however will be expanded upon by the work of Van den Berg (2010) in order to include the experience of “genuine other”. The findings of these analyses will be discussed in the last chapters of this thesis.

186,Attitudes toward ads portraying women in decorative roles and female competition: an evolutionary psychology perspective,"The portrayal of women in advertising is a prolific research topic and extant studies have emphasized the negative attitudes of female consumers toward stereotypic depictions of women in advertising in general. However, empirical evidence regarding female consumers’ responses to specific ads depicting women in decorative roles is scarce and conflicting. Drawing on the principles of evolutionary psychology, the present paper proposes that women's attitudes toward such ads are underlied by the evolved context-sensitive mechanism of intrasexual competition. Relevant hypotheses are tested through two experimental studies. The findings indicate that decorative portrayals in advertising elicit more favorable attitudes when female consumers compete through a self-promotion strategy with regard to a competitor derogation one. Additionally, the temporal orientation of self-referencing during ad processing emerges as a moderator of the influence of the motivational state elicited by the medium context on attitudes.",Current Research on Gender Issues in Advertising,2016.0,135,18,2,False,,,,"AG Kyrousi, GG Panigyrakis… - International Journal of …, 2016 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'GG Panigyrakis', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jMeOXw0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=jMeOXw0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'jMeOXw0AAAAJ'}]",186,118310130,Antigone G.

190,Contextualising family microaggressions and strategies of resilience among young gay and bisexual men of Latino heritage,"Abstract Young Latino gay and bisexual men experience discrimination due to heterosexism and racism from within and beyond their communities. Although most research has emphasised overt forms of discrimination, a growing body of research is examining the effects of microaggressions, or indirect forms of discrimination, on racial and sexual minorities. The purpose of this study was to explore the contexts of various types of microaggressions, as well as describe the resilience strategies used by young adult Latino gay and bisexual men living in Los Angeles, California. A sample of 21 young Latino gay and bisexual men aged 18 to 29 years were recruited to complete qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews following a phenomenological approach. Three contextual themes relevant to microaggressions emerged: (1) microassaults, (2) microinsults and (3) microinvalidations. Three themes emerged around the resilience strategies to overcome these experiences: (1) self-discovery, (2) adaptive socialisation and (3) self-advocacy. Family and community-based efforts to reinforce and expand resilience repertoires are needed to help young Latino gay and bisexual men.","Culture, Health and Sexuality",2017.0,55,29,2,True,"The contexts of various types of microaggressions, as well as the resilience strategies used by young adult Latino gay and bisexual men living in Los Angeles, California are explored.",,"[{'title': 'nih.gov', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5303621/'}]","MJ Li, JP Thing, FH Galvan, KD Gonzalez… - Culture, health & …, 2017 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'MJ Li', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GnEMEcAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=GnEMEcAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'GnEMEcAAAAAJ'}]",190,8392727,Michael J.

191,Nordic Perspectives on the Postwar Avant-Garde,"A Cultural History of the Avant-Garde in the Nordic Countries 1950–1975 presents a fascinating and, at over eight hundred pages, truly extensive set of new analyses by mostly Scandinavian scholars and curators of avant-garde experiments in art, literature, film, music, and culture in the Nordic countries. It forms the third installment of four planned volumes covering avant-garde activity in each quarter of the twentieth century by artists from, or in many cases working in, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Iceland.1 The book presents an impressive overview of seemingly every imaginable aspect of avant-garde activity in Scandinavia. It addresses not only major Scandinavian artists such as Oyvind Fahlström and Kirsten Justesen, but also case studies of artists’ books, journals, electronic music studios, experimental performance groups, hippie communes, concrete poetry broadcasts, and other events that together challenge and expand the more familiar histories of the period. While many of the individual texts summarize other scholarship in the Scandinavian languages or leave the larger theoretical or historical context to be mapped in greater depth elsewhere, the volume as a whole contains valuable discussions of movements that have in many cases not been previously documented for readers in English. The most notable feature of the book is its incredible diversity of narratives and perspectives on Nordic events that are relatively unknown or known only from specific non-Nordic perspectives, like the emphasis in histories of Fluxus on the AmericanLithuanian artist George Maciunas. Consider the following six events, which happened while American audiences were too busy watching the flag landing on the moon to notice: On May 30, 1969, Denmark became the first country to legalize pornographic images. The same day, several newspapers reported a mysterious incident in which a woman walked naked, holding a white cross in her hand, through the center of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange: “Horrified stockbrokers gave way for her as she walked through the room with determination, and before anyone could do anything but gape she disappeared through the entrance door” (Politiken, May 30, 1969, quoted on 64). The woman was artist Lene Adler Petersen, working in collaboration with Bjørn Nørgaard on a work now known as Expulsion from the Temple/Nude Female Christ, described in the essay by Rune Gade. The two artists were involved in the zine Hætsjj (loosely translated as “smear campaign,” 1968–70), which deliberately challenged the existing limits to free expression and was legally exonerated as Danish sexual mores changed overnight. Their action, collapsing the highly gendered and normally radically separated spheres of sex, religion, art, altruism, and business, is hardly conceivable today. In 1969 Inger Christensen published det (“it”), arguably the most important literary work of the Danish avant-garde in the 1960s. Integrating experimental poetry with counterculture politics, it crossed lyric expression with serial composition. It is divided into three parts, Prologos, Logos, and Epilogos—the first featuring eight blocks, each consisting of sixty-six lines with exactly sixty-six characters—each section following its own predetermined structure. The poetic architecture features parts that read individually as lyrical, but taken together, are more like “the products of a little poem-machine” (75). Developing like a biological evolution, from creation to complex social politics particular to the 1960s, complete with references to collectivism and counterculture, it “sometimes reads like a biological avantgarde machine and sometimes like a vision of utopia as a collective erotic process” (78). In 1971, Anker Jørgensen, a defender of the welfare state and the future prime minister of Denmark, read part of the poem to the public on television:",,2017.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,191,66898087,Karen Kurczynski,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,Review
192,Social Inequality and Assessments of Democracy and the Market: Evidence from Central and Eastern Europe,"Abstract Considerable comparative scholarly attention has been paid to various aspects of mass support for democracy and the market. However, despite strong theoretical suggestions of a linkage, little is known about the impact of social inequality on this support. We address this issue using evidence from mass surveys undertaken in 12 post-communist states in 2007, supplemented by country-level data about economic and political performance. Specifically, we investigate whether social inequality generates negative perceptions that democracy and the market will lead to social conflict and if it increases support for anti-democratic forms of governance. Notably, we find little link between citizens’ expectations of social conflict and national-level indices of income inequality. However, we do find a link between perceptions of the extent of social inequality and expectations of market-generated—but not democracy-generated—conflict. Underscoring these positive and negative findings, perceptions of social inequality are also clearly consequential for support for ‘strong-hand’ economic government but not for anti-democratic leadership.",,2013.0,63,13,1,False,,,,,,192,8014994,S.

196,"Improving Mental Health Care for Transgender Consumers: Providers’ Attitudes, Knowledge, and Resources","Transgender individuals may present for treatment with a variety of mental health needs, both related and peripheral to their gender identity and expression. Compounding stigma and other life stressors elevate mental health risks in transgender communities, and the barriers to mental health services are manifold. As such, the current research study was designed to determine the competency of mental health care providers to address the unique needs of transgender consumers. Online surveys gauged mental health providers’ knowledge of transgender issues, implicit and explicit transphobic attitudes, as well as treatment decisions with transgender and cisgender consumers; moreover, workplace resources and infrastructure were assessed. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) that types of providers (i.e., different degrees and training) would vary on their implicit transphobic attitudes, explicit transphobic attitudes, and transgender-related knowledge; (2) that explicit and implicit attitudes would predict treatment of transgender consumers; and (3) that knowledge would be predictive of implicit and explicit attitudes. While implicit attitudes were not found to be significant in any of these hypotheses, explicit attitudes varied across provider types, F(4,69) = 7.025, p < .01, and were significantly correlated with knowledge b = -.481, t(79) = -4.875, p < .001. Knowledge also varied significantly across provider type F(4,66) = 2.65, p = .041. Finally, explicit attitudes were significantly correlated with differences in treatment decisions in working with transgender and cisgender consumers b = .333, t(60) = 2.735, p = .008. These results suggest that improving transgender-related competencies among mental health providers might facilitate reductions in explicit biases, thereby alleviating certain instances of discriminatory treatment toward transgender individuals in mental health care settings. Implications for advocacy and organizational change are discussed.",,2016.0,97,0,0,False,"It is suggested that improving transgender-related competencies among mental health providers might facilitate reductions in explicit biases, thereby alleviating certain instances of discriminatory treatment toward transgender individuals in mental health care settings.",,,,,196,47548215,H.

197,Analysis of supply chain operations reference (SCOR) and balanced scorecard (BSC) in measuring supply chains efficiency using DEMATEL and DEA techniques,"
Purpose
The strategic management of the supply chain encompasses the development and integration of a supply chain strategy and the evaluation of the findings. An integrated approach is required for linking the supply chain strategy with the overall strategic management of the company for it to be successful. In this regard, this paper aims to examine and compare the relative efficiency of two models, namely, supply chain operations reference (SCOR) and the balanced scorecard (BSC) for measuring the supply chain performance.


Design/methodology/approach
A quantitative research design is used and 800 individuals were recruited from the industrial sector in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. A three-tier model was used based on BSC, data envelopment analysis (DEA), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL).


Findings
The findings have indicated that DMUs 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 were efficient, while the other DMUs were non-efficient. These non-efficient units were not aware of the training and development and learning and growth. The concern presents comparatively poor performance of employees at this stage even this issue was based on system performance and indifference of managers, establishing complexities in the long-term system. The relationships were determined among four dimensions of BSC by identifying the supply chain metrics and applying the DEMATEL approach.


Originality/value
The current study provides empirical support for the DEA network model concerning its preference and improved performance measurement as compared to BSC model.

Understanding professionals’ views on whether and how stereotypes communicate is important for anyone who believes it beneficial to reduce future stereotypical representations. Using qualitative interviews with 42 practitioners, this study detailed seven themes concerning professionals’ perceptions of the role and function of stereotypes in advertising, including beliefs that stereotypes are based in truth, are attractive to audiences, communicate quickly, simplify processing, prevent distraction, prevent thinking, and are the obvious solution. Practitioners felt stereotypes were used most appropriately when they were subverted or challenged in advertising messages.

A common and pervasive threat to cross-cultural interpersonal relationships, such as supervision, is the presence of racial microaggressions (Constantine & Sue, 2007). According to Carter (2007) and Helms, Nicholas, and Green (2012), microaggressions are so damaging, that they may even trigger traumatic responses in recipients. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among racial microaggressions in supervision, the supervisory working alliance, and traumatic symptomatology in supervisees. This study collected survey data from 86 participants who self-identified as racial, ethnic, or cultural minority group members and who were counselors-in-training, professional counselors, or counselor educators. Data collection included responses to demographic questions, the adapted Experiences of Black Supervisors Scale (EBSS adapted; Barnes, 2011), the Trauma Symptom Check-list 40 (TSC-40; Elliot & Briere, 1992), and the Supervisory Working Alliance Inventory – Trainee Version (SWAI-T; Efstation, Patton, & Kardash, 1990). Bivariate correlations revealed significant relationships among all three of the main variables. The SWAI-T full-scale scores had a moderate negative correlation with the EBSS (adapted) full-scale scores (r = -.637, p < .01) and a moderate negative correlation with the TSC-40 full-scale scores (r = -.372, p < .01). The EBSS (adapted) full-scale scores had a moderate positive correlation with the TSC-40 full-scale scores (r = .513, p < .01). Regression analysis yielded a model whereby 40.6% of the variation in the supervisory alliance can be explained by microaggressions in supervision F (1, 48) = 32.752, p < .01. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis determined that the presence of traumatic experiences does not add to the predictive capacity of the model. The results suggest that the presence of racial microaggressions is an important impediment to the supervisory working alliance. Implications, limitations, and future directions were provided.

202,'Playing Two People': Exploring Trans Women's Experiences in Sex Work,"When not invisibilized in society, transgender women are subject to pervasive transphobia in the social sphere and encounter devastating discrimination across the institutions. In light of discrimination in the mainstream job market, many look to the sex industry for a source of income. In fact, trans women have long ties to the sex work community and have been foundational to the sex workers rights movement, engaging in activism predating Stonewall. Yet, the experiences of trans women who sell sex remain largely overlooked in historical retellings and social science research on sex work. By creating space for the voices of those who have long gone unheard – conducting in-depth interviews with seven transgender women who sell sex – this thesis seeks to move beyond the dominant narrative of sex workers and bring greater attention to their unique experiences. This thesis explores the experiences of trans women in sex work as it relates to their labour practices and processes, engagement with the criminal justice system, and health and access to health and social services. Challenging the ways in which norms have been produced and sustained under the guise of ‘truth’, this thesis applies the concepts intersectionality and stigma to explore how experience is conditioned by the environment of oppression – at the intersection of sexism and cisgenderism – and the social judgment and marginalization of sex workers. Alongside navigating through the hardships associated with the criminalization and stigmatization of sex work, trans women who sell sex are subject to intensified violence, discrimination and oppression on the basis of gender. Amidst the height of the trans rights movement and in light of the recent amendments to federal legislation that protects trans Canadians from discrimination, this thesis considers what is warranted to achieve social change. Reflecting on history and looking to the future, it is imperative that the trans and sex worker communities forge stronger bonds in their battle for rights. ‘PLAYING TWO PEOPLE’ iii",,2017.0,188,1,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'uottawa.ca', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/36706/3/Laidlaw_Leon_2017_thesis.pdf'}]",L Laidlaw - 2017 - ruor.uottawa.ca,,202,120502414,Leon Laidlaw,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,
203,Exploring the interactive role of narcissism and self-esteem on self-presentation,"ABSTRACT Although most research treats narcissism and self-esteem as additive predictors of outcomes, some clinical theorizing and data suggest they may interact to predict some socially undesirable outcomes. Unfortunately, little evidence exists for this idea. Following psychodynamic theorizing, we speculated that, as self-esteem increases, narcissism might relate less positively to antagonistic self-presentations but no differently to benign self-presentations. In two studies (one pre-registered), participants self-reported their narcissism, self-esteem, and self-presentation tactic use. As self-esteem increased, narcissism generally related less positively to using tactics portraying meanness, superiority, neediness, and blamelessness. However, self-esteem failed to change relations between narcissism and tactics portraying competence and likability. Findings align with some clinical notions and inform how narcissism and self-esteem interactively contribute to social behavior.",Self and Identity,2021.0,107,4,0,False,,,,,,203,145281770,W.

Rather than resisting, it is argued that young women are conforming en mass to soft-porn imagery and practices and in doing so, have lost touch with their own desires. To highlight some of the problems with these accounts, in this paper I draw on interview data from research into young Australian men and women's interpretations of sex and sexual risk. However, to pursue my key argument I focus only on the young women's accounts. Findings show that rather than being saturated in raunch culture, young women are exposed to multiple, often contradictory cultural discourses relating to gender and sex, which they differently incorporate, transform and sometimes reject as they construct sexual narratives. I conclude that the raunch culture literature is couched in a series of damaging generalisations which ignore youth diversity and position women as agents of their own oppression but not of their own desire.",,2012.0,112,57,3,False,,,"[{'title': 'utas.edu.au', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'http://ecite.utas.edu.au/78545/3/78545%20-%20Examining%20the%20raunch%20culture%20thesis.pdf2013-03-08monthly1.0'}]","EC Bishop - Journal of Youth Studies, 2012 - Taylor & Francis",,204,2071253744,E.

The idea of teaching composition with a hard link to SToM may well offend a few instructors, particularly those expressivists in the Romantic tradition whose creative vision for First Year Composition is deeply inward-looking, or the odd leftover current traditionalist whose formalist approach to college composition rarely goes beyond the textbook, the digital ""learning environment"" or the classroom door. The potential benefits of a SToM-based pedagogy go far beyond simply creating a more persuasive classroom composition.

207,Future Mrs. President or Simply Bill's Wife? : A Content Analysis of New York Times Coverage of Hillary Clinton in 2008 versus 2016,"This study analyzed New York Times coverage in January 2008 and January 2016 of Hillary Clinton. Coverage of Hillary during these two months was compared based on the number of times the categories family and appearance were mentioned. In four of the subcategories, the results show that fewer stories mentioned aspects of Hillary’s family and appearance in 2016 than in 2008. These findings support the hypotheses and indicate a change in the way media is discussing female politicians, along with the country’s support of them. FUTURE MRS. PRESIDENT OR SIMPLY BILL’S WIFE? 4 Introduction Feminists have been fighting for equal rights for women for over 100 years now. Despite that commitment to change by a large mass of individuals, women still face many inequalities on multiple levels in this country. This inequality is present in politics and female representation in government of all levels. Women are not treated as equal to men in the political sphere and our country has made it especially challenging for females to be successful politicians. A contributing factor to this challenge is our media’s representation of women. In general, the media does not accurately represent the female gender as a whole. More specifically, female politicians are not represented accurately, contributing to our country’s resistance to female representation in our government. As these inaccurate representations continue to persist, people continue to believe that women are not equal and do not belong in governmental roles. There is a very distinct difference in the way female politicians are discussed in media versus male politicians. Women also face different pressures and critiques by the media. Female politicians are critiqued about everything from their clothing, to their hair, to the way they laugh. Why does it matter if our leader is wearing one color versus the other, don’t we just want someone to make the right decisions based on their education and experience? However, that is not the case and this unequal focus on appearance and factors unrelated to professional qualifications continues to persist. This study will narrow in on this idea of inequality, specifically with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It will look at the way the media has changed the way she is represented and portrayed, by juxtaposing coverage from the 2008 election with coverage from the 2016 election. This analysis will look to see if the focus on aspects of her identity outside of those that qualify her for the job of president still persists from one election to the next. FUTURE MRS. PRESIDENT OR SIMPLY BILL’S WIFE? 5 Literature Review News media are guilty of underrepresenting and misrepresenting women, especially those in the political sphere. News media also often focuses more on gender norms when it comes to their coverage of women. The existing literature on Hillary Clinton in news media demonstrates this misrepresentation, as well as the focus on her gender. Some research focuses on her level of power, some on her femininity and masculinity, some on her role in Bill Clinton’s life as well as his role in her life, and some on how she is portrayed in media. This literature will help answer the question posed, regarding specifically what the representation of Hillary looks like, how that is potentially specific to her gender, and how it has changed over time. The literature relevant to this topic fits into five main categories: equality in coverage, gendered language, campaign environment, clothing, and image production and power level. While each study has a different focus, there are similarities and trends among the research. Equality in Coverage The large issue at hand in this discussion is the lack of accurate and fair coverage the media gives female candidates/politicians in comparison to male candidates. Dunaway, Lawrence, Rose, and Weber (2013) state, “A basic hurdle historically faced by female candidates has been gaining equal news exposure to male candidates” (715). This study compared coverage of contests both with and without female candidates, finding that contests with females elicit more trait coverage than male-only contests, and races with females are more likely to elicit trait coverage than issue coverage. This shows that not only is there a lack of frequency of coverage of women, but also a difference in content, to the disadvantage of females. FUTURE MRS. PRESIDENT OR SIMPLY BILL’S WIFE? 6 Hayes, Lawless, and Baitinger (2014) discuss how stereotypes persist about what traits in women people should focus on. In cases where the media have drawn attention to these stereotypes in their coverage, they in turn become the focus of those consuming the media coverage. Their findings and those of past researchers in the field show that the media’s focus on looks and appearance traits takes away from potential coverage of the issues they are addressing and the way they can benefit our country as a leader. Gendered Language Research shows that the way male and female politicians are spoken to in the media and the way they are conditioned to speak differs from gender to gender. Suleiman and O’Donnell (2008) conducted research to answer the question: does gender make a difference in the way politicians speak and are spoken to in public? This study quotes Hall (2000), “[...] social identity (which includes gender identity) is a reflection of power relations in society” (17). This research looks to Hillary’s language and language spoken to her in comparison to her power level and gender to determine if there is a connection between these variables. Hillary follows, to some extent, “the historic designation of women’s language as the language of the non-powerful” (45). Utilizing research done by Lakoff in the 70’s, Suleiman and O’Donnell (2008) found the same result 30 years later, “[...] we do find many of the exact same features that distinguish men (powerful) from women (powerless) with respect to language choices more than 30 years later and with two of the most powerful contemporary politicians in the US” (45). This research shows these norms are embedded in the way politicians are spoken to and has created these unbreakable levels of power among genders. FUTURE MRS. PRESIDENT OR SIMPLY BILL’S WIFE? 7 Campaign Environment During elections, the media inadvertently creates a high-pressure environment for candidates and establishes high expectations of them. Lawrence and Rose (2010) address the idea of “exit talk” in their research. This is the pressure the media puts on candidates during elections to step down from the race once it becomes more apparent that they are not going to win. During Hillary Clinton’s campaign for presidency in 2008, the presence of exit talk was more frequent than for any other candidate in the past. As soon as it became apparent that she would not be in the running any longer, the media pressured her to step down, implementing more pressure than any other candidate in the past. In Ritchie’s (2013) research around the representation of Hillary Clinton in illustrations during her campaign, she was portrayed as a non-human cyborg. This research implies that the idea of a female running for president can be so abnormal to some people, that the media both pressures females to step down soon and points out how strange it is for them to be running in the first place. Research conducted by Hayes and Lawless (2015) actually presents an interesting counter or follow-up to the existing literature. This research found that voters were not influenced by the gender of the candidates but only by their ideologies. So while the media is constantly putting extra pressure on female candidates and presenting them in a negative light throughout their candidacy, the voters are still supportive of them and do not always take their gender into consideration when it comes time to vote. This research is important because it shows that we are getting closer to equality for all those in positions of power; the media is just behind on their representation of this. FUTURE MRS. PRESIDENT OR SIMPLY BILL’S WIFE? 8 Clothing In Flicker’s (2013) research, images of female and male politicians were analyzed using the Double-Bind theory. The study found that when female politicians dress within the feminine standards expected of them, they are not taken seriously. However, when they attempt to dress more masculine, they are judged for dressing outside the norm, and become trapped in the Double Bind. “The term ‘Double Bind’ refers to a situation in communication where two differing, conflicting messages are being received simultaneously” (Flicker, 2013, 203). In this case, females are conditioned to believe that being feminine is bad in the political world, and then attempt to act more masculine. This result, however, is also thought of as bad. So female politicians receive conflicting information from society about how they should dress and act in a powerful position. This study shows that there is a large emphasis on the masculinity of the candidates. The media focuses on the femininity and masculinity of female candidates and allows their clothing choice and the way they carry themselves to dictate what is covered about them. The emphasis the media puts on this aspect of the candidates dictates how the candidates choose to portray themselves and their identities. Image Production and Power Level The media has constructed a certain image of Hillary for consumers, especially when it comes to her power. Brown (1997) looks at the representation of Hillary Clinton in the media during the time she was First Lady. Brown explains that women are just shown in public as a sign for something, but are not allowed to be public speakers, “[...] women function as sources of meaning, carrying rather than creating meaning. They are to be seen but are not given the privilege of speaking for themselves” (257). The focus groups in Brown’s (1997) research found FUT",,2016.0,14,1,0,True,,,,,,207,120981754,Chandler E.

210,The Message is in the Bottle: Latino Youth Communicating Double Standard Ideologies Through Photovoice,"Background Young Latinas living in the United States experience inordinate sexual and reproductive health outcome disparities. However, though prioritized as subjects for prevention, they are also often denied sexual agency. Purpose This article reports the results of a study conducted to examine young Latino/a participants' perspectives on communicating and learning about sexuality in school and family settings. Methods A Photovoice project was conducted with 20 Latino/a high school students. Each participant received a digital camera to take photos for 2 discussion sessions. Participants discussed select photos in relation to self-generated topics. Results One overarching theme, double standards in expectations about sexual communication, and 2 related subthemes, contrasting gender expectations in sexual desire and pleasure and confirming ideologies in sexual taboos and disconnections, emerged during discussions. Discussion The persistence of a double standard placing responsibility for sexual protection on young women indicates a need to design health education programs centered on a critical examination of gendered and sexual expectations. Translation to Health Education Practice Research findings on gender inequities should be translated to health education practice. In sexuality education this means conducting activities that address subjectivity and agency as they are accorded to participants in their everyday lives.",,2013.0,56,23,0,False,,,,,,210,6372321,A.

212,Shifting the focus: Nonpathologizing approaches to healing from betrayal trauma through an emphasis on relational care,"ABSTRACT As the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders has become increasingly medicalized (Conrad & Slodden, 2013), consideration for the relational nature of trauma has been minimized in the healing process. As psychiatrist R. D. Laing (1971) outlined in his essays, the medical model is an approach to pathology that seeks to find medical treatments for symptoms and syndromes based on categorized diagnoses. We argue that such a model implicitly locates the pathology of trauma within the individual instead of within the person(s) who perpetrated the harm or the social and societal contexts in which it took place. In this article, we argue that this framework is pathologizing insofar as it both prioritizes symptom reduction as the goal of treatment and minimizes the significance of relational harm. After providing a brief overview of betrayal trauma (Freyd, 1996) and the importance of relational processes in healing, we describe standard treatments for betrayal trauma that are grounded in the medical model. In discussing the limitations of this framework, we offer an alternative to the medicalization of trauma-related distress: relational cultural therapy (e.g., Miller & Stiver, 1997). Within this nonpathologizing framework, we highlight the importance of attending to contextual, societal, and cultural influences of trauma as well as how these influences might impact the therapeutic relationship. We then detail extratherapeutic options as additional nonpathologizing avenues for healing, as freedom to choose among a variety of options may be particularly liberating for people who have experienced trauma. Finally, we discuss the complex process of truly healing from betrayal trauma.",Journal of Trauma & Dissociation,2016.0,164,46,1,False,It is argued that this framework is pathologizing insofar as it both prioritizes symptom reduction as the goal of treatment and minimizes the significance of relational harm.,,"[{'title': 'researchgate.net', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura-Noll-4/publication/283241568_Shifting_the_Focus_Non-Pathologizing_Approaches_to_Healing_from_Betrayal_Trauma_through_an_Emphasis_on_Relational_Care/links/5649f74c08ae295f644f99a9/Shifting-the-Focus-Non-Pathologizing-Approaches-to-Healing-from-Betrayal-Trauma-through-an-Emphasis-on-Relational-Care.pdf'}]","JM Gómez, JK Lewis, LK Noll, AM Smidt… - Journal of Trauma & …, 2016 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'JK Lewis', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YpUo_IkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=YpUo_IkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'YpUo_IkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'LK Noll', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oujt8REAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=oujt8REAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'oujt8REAAAAJ'}]",212,145644835,Jennifer M.

213,Registered Reports in the Journal of Sports Sciences,"We published a recent editorial on sample size estimation (Abt et al., 2020), which was one in a series of editorials over many years intended to encourage authors to improve the rigour of studies submitted to the Journal of Sports Sciences (Nevill et al., 2004; Winter et al., 2014). We continue this encouragement now with the introduction of the Registered Report submission format. As highlighted in our editorial (Abt et al., 2020), and by many others (Caldwell et al., 2020; Ioannidis et al., 2014; Munafò et al., 2017), there are a number of problems that plague modern science; publication bias, questionable research practices, and underpowered studies to name but a few. Jones and Brewer (1972) reported that for studies published in Research Quarterly (now Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport) the calculated power for different effect sizes was “disturbingly low” – 0.15, 0.54, and 0.83 for small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. These findings have been largely confirmed by similar studies in 1977, 2000, and 2020 that explored the same issues across numerous journals (Christensen & Christensen, 1977; Kinney et al., 2020; Speed & Andersen, 2000). Collectively, these studies suggest that the power of a typical study published in our discipline has a high probability of detecting a large effect, a medium probability of detecting a medium effect, and a very low probability of detecting a small effect. As noted by Speed and Andersen (2000), small effects in the sport sciences are often associated with the difference between winning and losing. As such, it is potentially important to be able to detect important effects, however small. Yet, underpowered studies are just one problem that sport and exercise scientists need to deal with. Questionable research practices and publication bias have been reported across a range of scientific disciplines (Ioannidis et al., 2014), and we are not immune (Caldwell et al., 2020). So, what are the solutions? A number of recommendations have been made over the last decade to improve the rigour of research and to minimise the introduction of these problems into the literature (Caldwell et al., 2020; Munafò et al., 2017). Two of these are the use of preregistration and the Registered Report submission format. Preregistration allows reviewers, editors, and readers to transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a prediction (Lakens, 2019). Preregistration (ideally a priori) involves publishing a timestamped protocol that outlines all data collection procedures together with a data analysis plan (Nosek et al., 2018). The data analysis plan usually involves identifying what are termed “confirmatory” and “exploratory” analyses (Caldwell et al., 2020). Publishing the data collection and analysis protocols prior to data collection allows authors to minimise the temptation to engage in questionable research practices (e.g., p-hacking, HARKing). Preregistration encourages greater transparency and rigorous reporting of study methods and analyses (Toth et al., 2020). Although we strongly support the use of preregistration, it is still open to abuse and manipulation (Ikeda et al., 2019; Yamada, 2018). The Registered Report format takes preregistration one step further by formalising the registration process and allowing reviewer feedback prior to data collection. Unlike the traditional peer-review process, which involves peer-review after data collection, the Registered Report format involves peer-review both before and after data collection (Chambers, 2013; Impellizzeri et al., 2019). This two-stage process not only has the benefits of preregistration but also allows authors to receive feedback on the proposed methods and data analysis before data collection, when they have the ability to modify these features. With a post-data peer-review process it is too late to make changes to the method, refine the research question, and/or hypotheses. Moreover, the Registered Report format has the potential to reduce publication bias by allowing editors to gauge the value of a study without being biased by the results. In an exploratory analysis, Allen and Mehler (2019) reported that the number of null findings increased from ~5-20% with traditional peer-review to ~60% with the Registered Report format. In a similar vein, Scheel et al. (2021) reported that positive findings reduced from 96% in the standard literature to 44% in Registered Reports. Although the Open Science Framework lists over 260 journals that offer the Registered Report format (Open Science Framework, n.d.), only a few of these are in the sport and exercise sciences, namely, Human Movement Science (Dessing & Beek, 2015), Science and Medicine in Football (Impellizzeri et al., 2019), Psychology of Sport and Exercise, and Registered Reports in Kinesiology. Like the other journals in our field that have implemented the Registered Report format, we encourage authors to embrace the methods of open science to improve the quality of their research. We hope authors will engage with this new submission type and we look forward to helping them through the two-stage process. Improving research practices is everyone’s responsibility – authors, journals, editors, and reviewers. At the Journal of Sports Sciences, we want to play our part in enabling researchers to do their best work, and we believe that the Registered Report format is a positive step towards that goal.",Jurnal sport science,2021.0,22,7,1,True,"The Registered Report format takes preregistration one step further by formalising the registration process and allowing reviewer feedback prior to data collection, and has the potential to reduce publication bias by editors by minimising the introduction of these problems into the literature.",,,,,213,2075853294,Grant Abt,2547562,C.

215,Challenges and Risks of Internet Use by Children. How to Empower Minors,"The aim of this paper is to reflect critically, using the latest data taken from reports, research, publications and other sources, on how to empower children in their daily Internet browsing given current online risks. These risks faced by children are a real concern for teachers, families and researchers and this article will focus on analyzing those online risks which produce the most emotional distress for children, namely grooming and cyberbullying. The use of the Internet, and the ease with which information or situations can be seen on it, has broken the social taboos associated with the risks that children are exposed to. Data such as 44% of children in Spain having felt sexually harassed on the Internet at any time in 2002, or 20% of U.S. children suffering cyberbullying according to a survey of 4,400 students in 2010, indicates the severity of the problem. Therefore, as stated in UNESCO’s MIL Curriculum for Teachers (Media and Information Literacy), it is necessary to work on the responsible use of the Internet by children and to empower them to reduce the possibility of them becoming future victims or bullies. At the end of the article we will develop a list of recommendations to be considered in the design of educational activities focused on the critical training of the minor’s use of the Internet. RESUMEN El objetivo de este articulo es reflexionar criticamente, a partir de una seleccion de ultimos informes, investigaciones, publicaciones y otras fuentes, sobre las orientaciones de como «empoderar» a los y las menores frente a los riesgos on-line actuales. Entre los diferentes riesgos quisieramos destacar los que mas violencia emocional producen; las situaciones de «grooming» o ciberacoso, cada vez mas visibles y urgentes de prevenir conjuntamente. El uso de Internet y la facilidad de visibilizar cualquier informacion o situacion ha permitido romper el tabu social respecto a estos riesgos. Datos como el que el 44% de menores en Espana se habia sentido acosado sexualmente en Internet en alguna ocasion en el 2002, o el que el 20% de ninos en Estados Unidos sufria ciberacoso, segun una encuesta realizada a 4.400 estudiantes en el 2010, nos indican la gravedad de la problematica. Por ello, tal y como se recoge en el Curriculum MIL de la UNESCO para profesores (Media and Information Literacy), es necesario trabajar el uso responsable de Internet por parte de los y las menores, para empoderarlos evitando que puedan convertirse en futuras victimas o acosadores. A partir de los riesgos reales que pueden padecer, asi como las respuestas cientificas y sociales que se han dado al respecto, elaboraremos una serie de recomendaciones a tener en cuenta en el diseno de actividades educativas enfocadas a la capacitacion critica de los y las menores en cuanto su uso de Internet.",,2012.0,31,18,1,False,,,,,,215,97654891,S.

220,"Sympathy and Reflection in Hume's Philosophy: Mind, Morals, Art and Politics","Hume, as an “anatomist” of human nature, believes that “the science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences”. The naturalistic and experimental analysis of human nature, as it informs his epistemology, is the basis for other areas. Thus, in order fully to understand his philosophy, we need to shed light on the connection between Hume’s experimental analysis of human nature in epistemology, and his naturalistic account in ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. However, too often, writers on the latter are not always fully informed on his general philosophy and vice versa. A principal aim of this research is to bring together investigation of his naturalistic epistemology, and his ethics, aesthetics and political philosophy. 
 
This project brings close attention to bear on all of these areas, focusing on three key concepts: sympathy, general rule, and reflection. First, I examine the nature of sympathy. I argue against recent interpreters who use his concept of sympathy to construct a solution to the Problem of Other Minds. On my interpretation, Hume employs the concept of sympathy for his ethics, aesthetics and political philosophy, not for his epistemology. Second, I show that the concept of general rule plays an essential role in his philosophy. On my interpretation, Hume first establishes the general rules of human nature. He then establishes the general rules of his ethics, aesthetics and political philosophy. Third, I uncover the role of reflection in his philosophy. According to him, it is wrong to apply abstract reasoning to matters of fact; Instead, we should adopt the experimental reasoning that he terms “reflection” to observe and generalise matters of fact, thus establishing general rules in ethics, aesthetics and political philosophy. In this way, we can see the intimate connections between these diverse aspects of his philosophical writings.",,2018.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,220,2036839456,Byoungjae Kim,,,,,,,,,,,Philosophy,
221,The Body Politic on Stage: Women Writers and Gender in Twentieth-Century Italian Theater,"Author(s): Streifer, Monica Leigh | Advisor(s): Re, Lucia | Abstract: My comparative study of works for the stage by three twentieth-century women writers traces a distinct feminist genealogy in Italian theater. I focus on authors whose plays have been overlooked or merit new interpretation: Amelia Pincherle Rosselli (1870–1954) at the turn of the century, Anna Banti (1895–1985) at mid-century, and Franca Rame (1929–2013) in the 1970s–1990s. I treat the works of these authors in terms of gender, revealing a vibrant tradition of female playwriting and performance in Italy that foregrounds women’s bodies, lives, and engagement with politics and culture. In exploring the intersections of feminism and theater, I show how drama is a particularly apt medium for the dissemination of feminist themes in the Italian context. Chapter 1 focuses on Rosselli’s emancipationist theater, and is the first study to treat her entire dramatic oeuvre in English. I argue that her plays should be read in light of her political activism and commitment to progressive causes, beliefs fostered by her upbringing in a Venetian-Jewish household whose members were dedicated to egalitarian principles. Chapter 2 uses Anna Banti’s Corte Savella as a case study for the modernist feminist practice of historical revisionism—the recasting of historical women as protagonists on the modern stage in order to provide new interpretations of their lives and legacies for contemporary audiences. Chapter 3 is dedicated to the reevaluation of Franca Rame’s life-long theatrical career, showing how she developed as an author and co-author. For Rame, feminism and theater intersect through explicit monologues that harness the power of performance to condemn hypocrisy, sexism, exploitation and violence against women worldwide. Theater has a deep cultural importance and historical legacy in Italy, but the existing canon tends to marginalize women’s voices, experiences, and histories. My dissertation thus addresses a dual critical need: to expand our understanding of the modern Italian theater canon by researching feminist plays; and to offer an in-depth and comparative study that articulates a specific female subjectivity in the theater.",,2016.0,0,2,0,False,,Book,"[{'title': 'escholarship.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://escholarship.org/content/qt14k1n5r5/qt14k1n5r5.pdf'}]",ML Streifer - 2016 - search.proquest.com,,221,112948350,M.

225,Haunting temporalities: Creolisation and black women's subjectivities in the diasporic science fiction of Nalo Hopkinson,"This study examines temporal entanglement in three novels by Jamaican-born author Nalo Hopkinson. The novels are: Brown Girl in the Ring (1998), Midnight Robber (2000), and The Salt Roads (2004). The study pays particular attention to Hopkinson’s use of narrative temporalities, which are shape by creolisation. I argue that Hopkinson creatively theorises black women’s subjectivities in relation to (post)colonial politics of domination. Specifically, creolised temporalities are presented as a response to predatory Western modernity. Her innovative diasporic science fiction displays common preoccupations associated with Caribbean women writers, such as belonging and exile, and the continued violence enacted by the legacy of colonialism and slavery. A central emphasis of the study is an analysis of how Hopkinson not only employs a past gaze, as the majority of both Caribbean and postcolonial writing does to recover the subaltern subject, but also how she uses the future to reclaim and reconstruct a sense of selfhood and agency, specifically with regards to black women. Linked to the future is her engagement with notions of technological and social betterment and progress as exemplified by her emphasis on the use of technology as a tool of empire. By writing science fiction, Hopkinson is able to delve into the nebulous nexus of technology, empire, slavery, capitalism and modernity. And, by employing a temporality shaped by creolisation, she is able to collapse discrete historical time-frames, tracing obscured connections between the nodes of this nexus from its beginnings on the plantation, the birthplace of creolisation and, as some have argued, of modernity itself.

227,CORTISOL RESPONSE TO PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING INFORMATION AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN,According to national statistics African American men have a 60% higher incidence rate are diagnosed at later stages and have twice the mortality rate of Caucasian men. The prostate cancer disparity is especially salient in North Carolina where African American men have a mortality rate that is almost 3 times that of Caucasian men. Although the American Cancer Society does not endorse routine prostate cancer screening it remains a priority to focus on prostate cancer screening education in African American men in the effort to evaluate psychological harms in providing prostate cancer educational information and to increase appropriate screening for early detection of prostate cancer in this high risk group. An underlying theme of research on barriers to screening is stress however stress related to receiving information about prostate cancer screening information and has never been studied from a psycho-physiological standpoint. The current study assessed relationships between cortisol response masculinity beliefs prostate cancer screening knowledge and intent health care utilization subjective distress and demographic characteristics among African American men in the pre-screening age range (aged 25-40 years). The primary research questions were 1) Do African American men exposed to information about prostate cancer screening evidence a measurable cortisol response following this exposure? and 2) Are masculinity beliefs and/or prostate cancer screening knowledge related to cortisol response following exposure to prostate cancer screening information?  The participant's mean cortisol levels after exposure to prostate cancer screening information (M = .157. SD = 08) were significantly less than baseline cortisol levels (M =.207 SD = .16) t(53) = -3.65 p = .001. Primary analyses revealed no significant associations between cortisol response and masculinity beliefs.  Results of secondary analyses revealed that participant's self-reported level of prostate cancer screening knowledge after exposure to educational information (M = 64.83 SD = 25.5) was significantly greater than (M = 22.08 SD = 24.00) t(35) = 9.36 p = < .001. Interestingly participants who reported not having a primary care physician had significantly greater prostate cancer screening knowledge change scores (M = 52.65 SD = 25.25) than those individual who reported having a primary care physician (M = 30.41 SD = 24.54) t(34) = 2.61 p = .013. However self- report of prostate cancer screening knowledge was not significantly different between the two groups after exposure to prostate cancer educational information. In addition a higher level of power dominance was positively associated with self-reported distress related to the DRE r(n = 36) = .38 p = .03 95% CI [.06 .63].  In conclusion providing prostate cancer screening information to African American men of prescreening age does not appear to be a stressor as measured by salivary cortisol. However identifying psycho-physiological barriers to behavior may lead to more innovative ways to improve positive behavioral outcomes in relationship to prostate cancer screening. Specifically increasing exposure to prostate cancer screening information in these men may increase confidence to have discussions with their doctors which is especially important in the light of the current stance of the USPSTF and conflicting recommendations from other organizations.,,2012.0,0,0,0,False,"Providing prostate cancer screening information to African American men of prescreening age does not appear to be a stressor as measured by salivary cortisol, however identifying psycho-physiological barriers to behavior may lead to more innovative ways to improve positive behavioral outcomes in relationship to prostate cancer screened men.",,,,,227,15220279,Amaris R.

Peterson University of New Hampshire, May, 2012 This dissertation is a qualitative study of seven privately-published family histories written by descendants of Mormon polygamists. Using methods of discourse and rhetorical analysis, these texts and various interviews are analyzed with the contention that identity is a rhetorical production and that the authors (either intentionally or unwittingly) fictionalize each of the identities involved—their own, their readers', and their ancestors'—to bring them together in moments of Burkean identification. These moments of identification are also analyzed in terms of communal and generational memory, temporal proximity, and communal discourses. An important conclusion in this study is that this rhetorical production of identity often results in silencing and marginalizing certain ancestors, such as those whose actions or values don't mirror the author's or the family's preferred identity—an identity greatly influenced by the communal discourse and identity of the Mormon Church.",,2012.0,52,0,0,False,,Book,"[{'title': 'unh.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1666&context=dissertation'}]",MK Peterson - 2012 - search.proquest.com,,229,2057775026,Michael K.

Questions arise as to how orthodox Mormon families come to terms with their child coming out in light of the Church’s policy on same-sex marriage and families. This article employs an exploratory case-study method to examine the experience of one such orthodox Mormon family whose child came out as gay. The findings herein suggest that it is possible for families and individuals in these circumstances to develop and maintain loving and supportive relationships in spite of religious differences. These findings better equip academics, professionals, clergy, and families to address the mental health concerns of and create inclusive spaces in families, congregations, and communities for youth who identify as sexual minorities.",,2017.0,103,7,1,False,,,,,,231,80353018,Elijah Nielson,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
232,Harassment Due to Gender Nonconformity Mediates the Association Between Sexual Minority Identity and Depressive Symptoms,"The visibility of a stigmatized identity is central in determining how individuals experience that identity. Sexual minority status (e.g., identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual) has traditionally been identified as a concealable stigma, compared with race/ethnicity or physical disability status. This conceptualization fails to recognize, however, the strong link between sexual minority status and a visible stigma: gender nonconformity. Gender nonconformity, or the perception that an individual fails to conform to gendered norms of behavior and appearance, is strongly stigmatized, and is popularly associated with sexual minority status. The hypothesis that harassment due to gender nonconformity mediates the association between sexual minority status and depressive symptoms was tested. Heterosexual and sexual minority–identified college and university students (N = 251) completed questionnaires regarding their sexual minority identity, experiences of harassment due to gender nonconformity, harassment due to sexual minority status, and depressive symptoms. A mediational model was supported, in which the association between sexual minority identity and depressive symptoms occurred via harassment due to gender nonconformity. Findings highlight harassment due to gender nonconformity as a possible mechanism for exploring variability in depressive symptoms among sexual minorities.",Journal of Sex Research,2016.0,92,60,4,False,Harassment due to gender nonconformity is highlighted as a possible mechanism for exploring variability in depressive symptoms among sexual minorities.,,,,,232,1398755533,A.

By the 20 January 2021, the cumulative numbers reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 had reached 169,379 including 630 deaths. Malaysia has been hit by three waves of COVID-19. This article reports on the three waves, the current situation and some of the possible factors associated. It outlines the need to reassess the overall situation, re-strategize the approach in order to contain the spread. The first COVID-19 wave lasted from 25 January to 16 February 2020, the second wave occurred between the 27 February 2020 and the 30 June 2020. The current third wave began on 8th September 2020.The sudden surge of cases in the third wave was mainly due to the two largest contributors, namely the Benteng Lahad Datu cluster in Sabah state and Kedah's Tembok cluster. The current situation is critical. The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to soar. The challengers faced by healthcare workers and other front liners is tremendous. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer are the leading cause of death in Malaysia. A paradigm shift in the approach is required to ensure the sustainability of the normal healthcare services provided by the government especially for the lower income groups. There is also a need to expedite the tabling of Tobacco Control Bill in coming parliament session which is long overdue.

This study examines the constructions of race and racism that emerge from a sample of online journals, compiled by students on the basis of their engagement with post-colonial literature. Departing from extant work on the discursive manifestation of resistance to difficult knowledge, we examine the ideologically productive ways in which students frame race and racism. We focus on the discourse through which particular understandings of race and racism are expressed and legitimised, as well as the perceived relevance of race and racism to the respondents’ own academic careers and personal lives. Owing to page constraints, the analysis is limited to those respondents who self-identify as white. The results underscore the various discursive frames that respondents draw on as a means of managing the perceived implications of difficult knowledge surrounding the continuation of racism, as the issue is broached in the context of post-colonial literature.",,2016.0,37,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'researchgate.net', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marthinus-Conradie/publication/288857217_Journaling_engagements_with_literature_on_racism_a_critical_race_theoretic_approach/links/56af028308aeaa696f2eda40/Journaling-engagements-with-literature-on-racism-a-critical-race-theoretic-approach.pdf'}]","M Conradie, M Brooks - African Identities, 2016 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'M Conradie', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2esWJHgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=2esWJHgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '2esWJHgAAAAJ'}]",236,114521643,M.

238,"Accountability, Complacency, or Obfuscation? An Analysis of the U.S. Military’s Prevention and Response Efforts to Military Sexual Trauma","On December 3, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced the end of the combat exclusion policy prohibiting women from serving in direct combat roles, regardless of the service branch or military occupation. For many, this represented the final barrier to women’s opportunity for equality within the armed forces, since many jobs and promotions are tied to combat experience. However, this historically significant milestone is juxtaposed against a recurring problem for the military that threatens its state of readiness and national security: military sexual trauma (MST). This article explores the prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the U.S. military, and the misleading, and often contradictory, data provided by military officials and the Department of Defense. The argument presented here is that the obfuscation of MST data has ethical implications for public administration, as it negatively impacts any meaningful prevention, intervention, and reform efforts. At a time of emerging global threats and with less than 1% of the American public currently serving in the all-volunteer military, can the nation continue to risk remaining ignorant about these preventable crimes against its service members?",,2017.0,76,2,0,False,,,,,,238,1405051287,M.

240,"Empowering the Party-Crasher: Donald J. Trump, the First 2016 GOP Presidential Debate, and the Twitter Marketplace for Political Campaigns","This article argues that an important political marketplace of keywords expands in social media around campaign events such as a debate; that rhetorical efforts to define the situation in which a campaign event occurs are met in this marketplace by user responses that more or less echo the keywords, thereby enhancing or diminishing the political power of their “caller” or speaker; and that social media monitoring platforms can enhance our understanding of public opinion influence competitions among candidates through the careful selection, tabulation, and inspection of words and phrases being voiced. In the case at hand, an analysis of Twitter volume data and a reading of a sample of 1200 tweets between July 30 and August 15, 2015, a period enveloping the first 2016 Republican presidential candidate debate on August 6, 2015, helps us understand how Donald J. Trump escaped political punishment from party and media elites for subverting Republican and U.S. norms of candidate behavior. Elite voices greatly disapproved of Trump’s debate performance and conduct, a traditional augury of declining public support. But the presence of social media voices enhanced Trump’s capacity to succeed with an insurgent marketing strategy, one he would continue into his election as president fifteen months later. Specifically, comparatively high user volume on a debate-oriented section of Twitter (i.e., posts with the hashtag #GOPDebate) for Trump’s name, slogan, and Twitter address, and for such advantageous keywords as “political correctness,” “Megyn Kelly,” and “illegal immigration” relative to terms and phrases favoring other candidates and Republicans as a whole indicates the presence of heavy and active popular support for Trump. The contents of the corresponding tweet sample exhibit Twitter-savvy techniques and populist stances by which the Trump campaign solicited that support: celebrity feuding, callouts to legacy media allies, featured fan comments, a blunt vernacular, and confrontational branding. The contents also illustrate ways in which users manifested their support: from the aforementioned high keyword volume to imitative behavior and the supplying of evidence to verify Trump’s contested claims during the debate.","Social Media, Political Marketing and the 2016 U.S. Election",2017.0,29,18,1,False,,,,,,240,50212156,Michael Cornfield,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

Taking a case study approach, this article examines the needs of chronically underserved lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) populations, particularly homeless transgender street youth, and efforts of community-based organizations to address them. To consider their needs, this article considers the legacy of transgender activist Sylvia Rivera along with four organizations that grew out of her work: the Street Trans Action Revolutionaries, Sylvia's Place, Sylvia Rivera Law Project, and New Alternatives for LGBT Youth. These organizations show the promise for using multiple methods, from direct action to direct services, while connecting the lessons of social movements with social services.

243,Analyzing gender differences in cohesion levels and the impact of mentoring in the U.S. army,"Throughout the centuries cohesion has been studied for its positive impact on military personnel. Researchers have found it to be a protective factor that mitigates mental health symptoms. It is therefore important to assess the current environment in the Army to see if Soldiers are receiving the benefits from high cohesion levels and analyze ways to improve this protective factor. One method of increasing cohesion found in previous research is through the use of mentoring relationships. This study used a snow ball sampling method and assessed current levels of cohesion in the Army, any possible gender differences, and the added effects a mentor relationship has on reported cohesion levels. A sample size of 170 Soldiers completed an online survey that assessed cohesion, demographic information, and information on mentor relationships. Through means comparison tests it was found that for this sample there are no significant gender differences on reported cohesion levels and perceived barriers to mentor relationships. However, Soldiers' who report having a mentor did report significantly higher levels of cohesion than Soldiers without a mentor. Interestingly, when broken down into the female population alone, no significant differences were found on cohesion levels for those with and without a mentor. These findings appear in contrary to previous literature, which suggests a possible new cultural change in the Army, differing views on the benefits of mentors from female Soldiers, or a possible sampling bias in this study. Future research should focus on a more diverse sample as well as examining other Military branches. Degree Type Dissertation Rights Terms of use for work posted in CommonKnowledge.

244,The Relationship Between Anti-Bias Curriculum and Cultural Competency Among Middle School Students,"Implementation of an anti-bias education framework is relatively new in the history of cultural competence movements. While some research has been done, sighting positive effects for K-12 students, few studies exist within the Montessori pedagogy. Furthermore, little research has been done in the effects of implementing this type of curriculum within a Montessori adolescent environment. Consequently, there is a need to gather information on effective anti-bias education best practices and how to introduce these strategies in a classroom environment. The purpose of this action research study is to explore how implementing anti-bias activities including literature, journaling, and Socratic discussions, affects students’ cultural proficiency in a Montessori Middle School . CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 3 Maria Montessori, Italian physician and educator, created a hands-on method of education that looked at each child not only through an academic lens, but nurtured their social, emotional, and spiritual growth. Credited by many as the founder of peace education, Montessori believed that the roots of creating peace on Earth are developed through the education we provide to children. Montessori (1947) believed only through intentionally teaching children about global citizenship, a respect for diversity, and personal responsibility toward correcting social injustices could world peace ever be achieved. In her study of the development of children, she found that adolescents were in the plane of social justice as they demonstrated strong interest in issues of injustice and finding ways to solve these problems. As a result, Montessori subsequently designed learning opportunities to engage adolescents in developing their role in the world. Several broad movements over the last 70 years in general education have taken place to help students gain a deeper understanding of culture. Historically, these movements have taken on many forms. From the desegregation of the 1950’s, the equal rights movement in the 1960’s, multiculturalism in the 1970’s, a shift to diversity in the 1980’s, a focus on cultural competence in the 1990’s, and finally the current focus on anti-bias education and cultural proficiency. The term culture has come to include far more than ethnic or racial differences, but to encompass age, gender, language, sexual orientation, faith, and physical abilities. (Lindsey, Nuri-Robins, Terrell, Lindsey; 2019). In creating an authentic Montessori adolescent environment, it is important for the curriculum to follow an anti-bias education framework, to be in alignment with Montessori philosophy and to meet the needs of the students these programs serve. Observations of students ages 12-14 in my Montessori adolescent environment have made me profoundly aware of adolescents’ strong desire to learn about issues relating to anti-bias education: from social CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 4 injustice to self-identification. Introducing meaningful curriculum, through age-appropriate literature, art, and weekly Socratic discourse (the dialogue between two or more people on philosophical or moral problems) may allow students a platform to learn about cultural identities, self-identification, and issues related to social justice. Review of Literature Learning to be a culturally proficient member of society is an important component of children’s education. Lindsey, Robins, and Terrell’s (2019) review the six points of the cultural proficiency continuum: cultural destructiveness, cultural incapacity, cultural blindness, cultural pre-competence, cultural competence, and cultural proficiency, with cultural proficiency being defined as the ability to respond in a variety of cultural settings to issues raised by diversity (p.8). According to Lindsey et al. (2003), Culturally proficient people may not know all there is to know about others who are different from them, but they know how to take advantage of teachable moments, how to ask questions without offending, and how to create an environment that is welcoming of diversity and change (p. 121). Kuh, LeeKeenan, Given, and Beneke (2016) write the ability to respect a range of human differences gives people the tools to recognize unfairness and bias and can encourage people to speak up for the rights of others. The goal of cultural proficiency has not always been at the forefront of education. Many classrooms had and still do have a cultural blindness or cultural pre-competence approach to diversity (Doucet and Adair, 2013; Kuh, et al. 2016; Lindsey, et al., 2003). Doucet and Adair (2013) write two of the most common ways of including the topic of race in classrooms is the color-blind approach or the celebration of diversity approach. CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 5 The color-blind approach places an emphasis on sameness or the idea that what people have in common matters more than the differences. Silencing conversations about differences misleads children into thinking that there is something wrong with diversity (p. 89-90) and can exacerbate oppression (Kemple, Lee, & Harris, 2015, p. 95). According to Doucet and Adiar (2013), “There is no evidence that ignoring visible differences benefits anyone. People’s histories—their ethnic backgrounds, national origins, religious legacies, racial heritages—are an important part of their identities. Silencing talk about difference may mislead children to thinking there is something wrong with the wonderful diversity in the world” (p. 90). Many adults assume that young children are color-blind, however, studies have proven that children notice racial cues as early as six months old and by age three or four have a rudimentary concept of race (Lee, Ramcey, & Sweeney, 2008, p. 68). The celebration of diversity approach is the other most commonly used approach. This approach aims to celebrate diversity through stories and special celebrations and is also known as the “tourist curriculum.” This approach fosters the idea that diversity is not part of everyday life but is something separate. It only focuses on the joys of differences, while ignoring bias and oppression (Doucet and Adair, 2013, p. 90). Banks (2013) echoes the problems with the “Heroes and Holidays” approach stating that ethnic content remains separate and distinct from the mainstream curriculum (p. 74). To educate culturally proficient students, research agrees that an anti-bias approach must be taken. Anti-bias education requires more than implementing a few activities. It is a way of teaching that supports children to develop a sense of identity in a diverse society (Kuh, et al., 2016, p. 58). Marulis (2000) writes an effective anti-bias curriculum is immersive and woven CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 6 into all areas of the classroom and curriculum (p. 27). Linking anti-bias ideas to all subject materials teaches children to be assertive against prejudice and discrimination (Byrnes & Kiger, 2005, p. 370; Killoran et al., 2004, p. 150). Current research on anti-bias education supports an immersive curriculum spanning all disciplines which includes topics such as race, ethnicity, class, gender, family structure, and abilities. Topics can be introduced through students’ observations or interests in both historical and current events (Kuh, et al. 2016, p. 58). Kuh and her colleagues (2016) recommend a framework for anti-bias teaching that they used in their 2015 study of one pre-K, one kindergarten, and one first and second grade classroom. First, teachers gather baseline data and entry points through watching children’s play and conversations and reviewing current events. Secondly, the teacher self-reflects on personal feeling about the topic, being sure to uncover any biases. Then, the teacher plans a meaningful activity to explore with the students. The teacher then responds and shares the outcome, making necessary adjustments during a post-activity reflection (p. 59). Kuh and her colleagues found this method of implementation effective and discovered that the students demonstrated more knowledge about race, ethnicity, and gender after the curriculum had been implemented. Additionally, Kuh et al. found that building a community of support and trust was necessary to facilitate this work. Doucet and Adair (2013) also write that dialog about anti-bias topics require a community of trust, listening and questioning, honesty, preparation and knowledge from the teacher, and an involvement of the family and community (p. 90-91). Using students’ personal and cultural knowledge will enrich the curriculum (Hyland, 2010, p. 83). Researchers have used discussion or dialog, literature, art activities, games, puzzles, and role play to facilitate student learning in anti-bias topics (Doucet and Adair, 2013; Killoran, et al. 2004; Kuh, et al. 2016; Marulis, 2000). Studies have demonstrated that encouraged with CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 7 meaningful discussion and questions, students begin to express, compare, and challenge their own views (Lee et al., 2008, p. 69). A study conducted in an early childhood environment by Lee, et al. (2008) found that art activities such as drawing self-portraits and discussing skin tones eventually led to students’ awareness of differences and responding to a variety of skin tone colors in a more positive way (p. 72). Studies by Lee, et al. (2008), Kemple, et al. (2015), and Killoran, et al. (2004) all saw positive results such as a greater understanding of racial terminology and bias though utilizing literature for anti-bias topics and discussion. Killoran, et al. (2004) implemented each text through a series of steps: 1) Class discussion reviewing what students already know about a particular equity issue, 2) Probe the students to question their reactions and stereotypes, 3) Examine overt types of discrimination, 4) Find hidden discrimination, and 5) Empower students to take action in a situation they could change (p. 152).

251,"Deconstructing Management Maxims, Volume II: A Critical Examination of Conventional Business Wisdom","A contrarian challenge to the status quo, this book vigorously champions healthy skepticism in management theory and practice. Several common management maxims -- often taken for granted as truisms -- are examined and debunked with evidence-based arguments. The constant repetition of these flawed tropes perpetuates their mythological status and limits personal and organizational performance. Eleven management maxims are rebuked using empirical data, original scholarship, literature reviews, field observations, and thoughtful opinions from numerous experts. Far from a business as usual business book, this has been researched with academic rigor yet written in an approachable style. Unafraid of taking on conventional business wisdom, it contains some controversial yet substantiated positions that will provoke critical thinking and debate. After all, sacred cows and long-believed tenets of management lore do not go away quietly. A clear message from this book is that you don't have to believe everything you read or hear-- be it in the classroom or at work! It offers a refreshing break from the constant drumbeat of dronish corporate and academic cliches.

254,X inactivation plays a major role in the gender bias in somatic expansion in a mouse model of the fragile X-related disorders: implications for the mechanism of repeat expansion.,"The Fragile X-related disorders are X-linked disorders resulting from the inheritance of FMR1 alleles with >54 CGG/CCG repeats in their 5' UTR. The repeats expand both somatically and on intergenerational transmission and increased repeat numbers are associated with increased risk of disease and increased risk of further expansion. The mechanism responsible for expansion is unknown. Here, we show in a knockin mouse model of these disorders that somatic expansion is much less common in females than in males. We show that this is due in large part to the fact that expansions occur only when the repeat is on the active X chromosome. However, even when this is taken into account, expansions in females are still less common than expected. This additional gender effect is not due to a protective effect of estrogen, a deleterious effect of testosterone or to differences in the expression of the Fmr1 gene or a variety of X-linked and autosomal DNA repair genes. However, our data do suggest that a higher level of expression of genes that protect against oxidative damage in females may contribute to their lower levels of expansion. Whatever the basis, our data suggest that the risk for somatic expansion may be lower in women than it is in men. This could help explain the reduced penetrance of some aspects of disease pathology in women. The fact that expansion only occurs when the Fmr1 allele is on the active X chromosome has important implications for the mechanism of repeat expansion.",Human Molecular Genetics,2014.0,47,26,1,True,"It is shown in a knockin mouse model of the Fragile X-related disorders that somatic expansion is much less common in females than in males, and a higher level of expression of genes that protect against oxidative damage in females may contribute to their lower levels of expansion.",,,,,254,10211068,Rachel Adihe Lokanga,1753615,Xiaonan Zhao,120776868,A.

255,Postbreeding Habitat Preference of Wood Ducks in Northern Alabama,"Habitat preference by postbreeding wood ducks (Aix sponsa) was studied in northern Alabama from October through December 1984 and August through November 1985. Habitat preference was similar between years, sexes, and age classes, and reflected use of a wetland complex throughout the postbreeding period. Preference usually did not change throughout daylight hours but did shift at night when birds moved to roosts. Wooded wetlands were the most preferred diurnal habitat from August through October, but wooded swamps were preferred most in November. Seasonally flooded hardwoods was the only habitat used after 15 December. Open water (>82% of available habitat) was not used. American lotus (Nelumbo lutea) patches were preferred roost habitat during August and September and wooded swamps were preferred roost habitat in November. Decreasing water levels and leaf senescence rendered lotus unavailable in November. We recommend that management of postbreeding wood duck habitat include the protection and maintenance of a forested wetland complex within which the flooding of hardwoods and protection of roost sites are emphasized. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 52(1):80-85 Wood ducks are among the most abundant and studied waterfowl species in North America but few investigations have addressed postbreeding habitat use (Gilmer et al. 1977, Parr et al. 1979). Information is lacking in the southern United States where large numbers of wood ducks reside throughout the year. Postbreeding waterfowl require different habitats for various aspects of daily activity such as feeding, resting, and roosting (Fredrickson and Drobney 1979). Differing physiological demands may dictate that waterfowl exhibit variation in preference among an array of potential habitats. We evaluated postbreeding habitat selection and the temporal and spatial changes in habitat preference by wood ducks in northern Alabama.

256,"The Cyborg and the Human: Origins, Creatureliness, and Hybridity in Theological Anthropology","Are we cyborgs or humans? This question is at the heart of this investigation, and the implications of it are all around us. In Christian theology, humans are seen as uniquely made in the image of God (imago dei). This has been taken to mean various things, but broadly, it suggests an understanding of humans as somehow discrete from, and elevated above, other creatures in how they resemble God. Cyborgs mark a provocative attempt to challenge such notions, especially in the work of Donna Haraway, whose influential ?Cyborg Manifesto? (1991) elaborated a way of understanding cyborgs as figures for the way we live our lives not as discrete or elevated, but as deeply hybridised and involved in complex ways with technologies, as well as with other beings. Significantly, Haraway uses the cyborg to critique notions of the human rooted in theological anthropology and anthropogeny: the cyborg was not created in Eden. This assertion is the starting point of my investigation of cyborgs and humans in theological anthropology. Analysis of this position is broken down into three key concepts throughout the investigation that form the three main parts of the structure: (1) What is the significance of Eden, specifically as a point of origin? What ideas do we inherit from Genesis mythologies, and how do they influence our multitudinous understandings of not only humans, but also cyborgs, that range from the Terminator, to astronauts, to hospital patients? What does it mean to say that the cyborg cannot recognise Eden or even dream of the possibility of return?(2) If the cyborg was not created in Eden, then is it still to be considered as creaturely? How does this figure tessellate into, or challenge, notions of human nature and sin in the absence of an origin or teleology in a Garden? What commentaries of the human as created in God?s image can we compare this to, and how do all of these readings bear on how we see ourselves and technologies? (3) More constructively, given that the cyborg amalgamates the organic and the mechanic, and discusses hybridity, how might this be appropriated by theological anthropology? What does it mean to say that we are hybrids? From these questions, I reflect on tensions between the cyborg and the human, and make suggestions for a theological appropriation of the cyborg figure that takes heed of the emphasis on hybridity by applying it to notions of Eden and imago dei. The overarching aim is to decentre and destabilise the human, and to refigure it within its broader networks that are inclusive of other creatures, technologies, and God.",,2015.0,169,1,0,False,,,,,,256,2486327,Scott A.

257,"Racism, segregation, and risk of obesity in the Black Women's Health Study.","We assessed the relation of experiences of racism to the incidence of obesity and the modifying impact of residential racial segregation in the Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of US black women. Racism scores were created from 8 questions asked in 1997 and 2009 about the frequency of ""everyday"" racism (e.g., ""people act as if you are dishonest"") and of ""lifetime"" racism (e.g., unfair treatment on the job). Residential segregation was measured by linking participant addresses to 2000 and 2010 US Census block group data on the percent of black residents. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Based on 4,315 incident cases of obesity identified from 1997 through 2009, both everyday racism and lifetime racism were positively associated with increased incidence. The incidence rate ratios for women who were in the highest category of everyday racism or lifetime racism in both 1997 and 2009, relative to those in the lowest category, were 1.69 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 1.96; Ptrend < 0.01) and 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.66; Ptrend < 0.01), respectively.

259,"Digital Performance: A History of New Media in Theater, Dance, Performance Art, and Installation","The past decade has seen an extraordinarily intense period of experimentation with computer technology within the performing arts. Digital media has been increasingly incorporated into live theater and dance, and new forms of interactive performance have emerged in participatory installations, on CD-ROM, and on the Web. In Digital Performance, Steve Dixon traces the evolution of these practices, presents detailed accounts of key practitioners and performances, and analyzes the theoretical, artistic, and technological contexts of this form of new media art. Dixon finds precursors to today's digital performances in past forms of theatrical technology that range from the deus ex machina of classical Greek drama to Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk (concept of the total artwork), and draws parallels between contemporary work and the theories and practices of Constructivism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, Futurism, and multimedia pioneers of the twentieth century. For a theoretical perspective on digital performance, Dixon draws on the work of Philip Auslander, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Jean Baudrillard, and others. To document and analyze contemporary digital performance practice, Dixon considers changes in the representation of the body, space, and time. He considers virtual bodies, avatars, and digital doubles, as well as performances by artists including Stelarc, Robert Lepage, Merce Cunningham, Laurie Anderson, Blast Theory, and Eduardo Kac. He investigates new media's novel approaches to creating theatrical spectacle, including virtual reality and robot performance work, telematic performances in which remote locations are linked in real time, Webcams, and online drama communities, and considers the ""extratemporal"" illusion created by some technological theater works. Finally, he defines categories of interactivity, from navigational to participatory and collaborative.

The survey revealed that the ideal professor places great emphasis on the integration of faith and learning, is flexible (and even easy), maintains high academic standards, encourages students, and has an adaptive teaching style. Findings also highlighted gender differences in student perception of the ideal professor. Women perceived an adaptable teaching style, encouragement, and integration of faith and learning as slightly more important than men did in defining the characteristics of an ideal professor. Implications are framed in terms of student expectations for content and relationship dimensions of learning associated with Christian colleges and universities.",,2012.0,74,9,1,False,,,,,,260,50058716,R.

The study considers the influence religio-spirituality has on their perceptions of pedagogy and student engagement. There are four major findings that emerged in this study, organized within two veins: (1) Religio-spiritual educator ideal as a guide for ways of being and teaching in the academy; and (2) Religio-spirituality’s relationship to equity and emancipation. This study is significant in that it identifies a largely under-theorized religio-spiritual frame employed by many Black women faculty in the US, and contributes to the literature in its exploration of the ways Judeo-Christian Black women faculty can serve as important resources and change agents in US higher education.",,2017.0,56,7,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/40181199/College_Teaching_on_Sacred_Ground--Edwards_online.pdf'}]","KT Edwards - Race Ethnicity and Education, 2017 - Taylor & Francis",,264,113319087,Kirsten T.

268,The perception of sexual harassment at university / La percepción del acoso sexual en el ámbito universitario,"Abstract The subjective perception of harassment victims is one of the key criteria when defining what sexual harassment is. In this context, the aim of this paper is to analyse the differences between men and women’s judgments of what behaviours constitute sexual harassment and how they are classified at university. To accomplish this, we administered a 38-item questionnaire to a sample of 1,693 people (1,521 students and 172 members of teaching staff, administration and services) at a Spanish university. The results indicate that there is a distinction associated with both the severity of the behaviours perceived and classified as sexual harassment (more severe and milder) and their content (coercion or sexual blackmail vs. environmental harassment). Within this perception, there is a clear combined effect of the variables of gender and position within the university community such that women, particularly female university staff members, classified more behaviours as mild sexual harassment.",,2014.0,41,11,1,False,,,,,,268,1403853294,V.

Men are the most likely victims of homicide but are rarely murdered by partners. Older women are most often killed in the home by a spouse or other family, consistent with the notion of “femicide.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation Supplemental Homicide Reports and the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey are utilized to illustrate trends by sex over time. Intimate partner homicide-suicide is examined via news surveillance. Strengths and limitations of data and methods are addressed. Homicide trends among the members of the baby boom cohort are predicted based on current and future patterns as they age. To facilitate prevention, researchers are encouraged to move beyond simple prevalence estimates toward greater understanding of complex trends, distinctions, and motivations of these violent deaths.",Journal of Elder Abuse & Neglect,2016.0,86,12,2,False,"A critical analysis of existing family violence literature related to elder abuse homicide, also known as “eldercide,” relates to fatal violence perpetrated by current or former intimates.",,,"S Salari, CD Maxwell - Journal of Elder Abuse & Neglect, 2016 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'S Salari', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FNWijDkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=FNWijDkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'FNWijDkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'CD Maxwell', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LTJWItwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=LTJWItwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'LTJWItwAAAAJ'}]",269,32649980,S.

271,Development Of The Transgender Attitudes And Knowledge Scale (Trans) And Evangelical Christians' Attitudes Toward Transgender,"In recent years, issues surrounding transgender have gained more media and legal attention than ever before, contributing to rapidly shifting views on gender around the world. In the U.S., views of evangelical Christians on social issues are of particular interest because of the ways in which Christian thought has impacted the setting of various norms in this nation. Yet, to date, there are no known studies that have explored evangelical Christians’ attitudes toward transgender persons. To address the shortcomings in the existing literature, the first phase of this study developed and validated a contextually relevant scale. A multi-phase creation and validation process, using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted with a diverse sample (n=533). The resulting scale is a three-factor 29-item measure, tapping into interpersonal comfort, gender belief, and human value. Using the validated scale, the second phase of the study explored evangelical Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward transgender persons in reference to a nonreligious group (n=438). Data were analyzed using Two-way ANOVAs, item analyses, independent sample t-tests, and Pearson’s correlations. Findings indicated that evangelical Christians showed significantly lower attitude scores and a more dichotomous/fixed view of gender compared to their nonreligious counterparts. At the same time, evangelical Christians had high ratings on the human value factor overall, which was, in turn, less correlated with the other factors— interpersonal comfort and gender beliefs—than for their secular reference group. The two studies together provide a starting point for future research on attitudes toward transgender.",,2016.0,59,2,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'missouristate.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3356&context=theses'}]",Y Kanamori - 2016 - bearworks.missouristate.edu,"[{'name': 'Y Kanamori', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iyfXxQsAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=iyfXxQsAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'iyfXxQsAAAAJ'}]",271,19229709,Yasuko Kanamori,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
272,The Disciplines of Arabic Literature,"The Arabic literary tradition is a long one, stretching back to undocumented beginnings in the Arabian Peninsula in the pre-Islamic (pre-7th century) era. The study of that heritage in Western academe began as a subset of the philological traditions of biblical and ancient Near Eastern scholarship, with their primary focus on the preparation of textual editions, compendia, dictionaries, and translations into European languages. In the specific context of studies devoted to the Arabic literary tradition, the study of the Qurʾān set the stage for the emergence of similar philological approaches to the variety of literary generic categories created within the increasingly widespread Arabic-speaking Islamic communities. The shift from the more philological approach to that of a more theoretically founded discipline of Arabic literature studies is a gradual one. Terry Eagleton notes (Literary Theory, 1983) that the discipline of literature studies—involving the interpretation of literary materials and their theorization—traces its beginnings to the early decades of the 20th century. In the case of the Arabic literary tradition, the shift can be traced to the second half of the same century, and as the result of a number of factors. In the Arabic-speaking regions themselves (in President Jamāl ʿAbd al-Nāṣir [Gamal Abdel Nasser] of Egypt’s terms, “from the [Atlantic] Ocean to the [Persian / Arabian] Gulf), changes in regimes led to the emergence of new political and social configurations, duly reflected in literary production. In the anglophone Western academic context, a consideration of the consequences of World War II led the governments of both the United States and Britain to establish commissions that led to the fostering of new approaches to the study of the regions of West Asia and North Africa and to the provision of funding for the creation of new centers and programs devoted to the modern period (however that was to be defined). Among the consequences of these new emphases was the need to offer instruction in the modern Arabic language and its dialects, thus providing students with skills that enabled them to avail themselves of opportunities to study at institutions in the Arabic-speaking world and to engage with Arab littérateurs and critics. The results of these various trends in Arabic literature studies during the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st, including the development of increasingly close affiliations with comparative literature studies, have shown themselves in a number of ways. As new centers of literary activity have emerged in different parts of the Arabic-speaking region (with the Gulf States as a primary example) and as Arab littérateurs have explored fresh genres and modes of expression (including media of a wide variety often expressed in colloquial dialect), so has literature scholarship set itself to apply new theoretical and critical approaches to the rapidly expanding publication sector. With the theorization of the discipline has come the need for a greater focus on individual genres, regions, and critical approaches and a concomitant move away from attempts to subsume “Arabic literature” under a single rubric. Such studies are not only opening up new avenues of inquiry, but are also demanding a re-examination of some of the principles and parameters governing the composition of Arabic literary history, both modern and premodern.",,2020.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,272,73466752,R.

274,Minority stress and mental health of homosexual and bisexual men and women: A review of research on the minority stress model from a Croatian perspective,"According to numerous research studies, homoand bisexual persons are twice as likely to develop mental health problems during their lifetime than heterosexual persons. The main goal of this review paper is to show how this higher incidence of poor mental health and well-being can be explained by the minority stress model. According to this model, sexual minorities are facing everyday challenges such as stigma, prejudice, and discrimination, which create a stressful environment for them. The paper explains the minority stress model proposed by Meyer and reviews current empirical findings supporting the model and its assumptions. Since social context is an integral part of this model, we review existing research that has examined parts of the minority stress model in Croatia, and look at the model from the perspective of contemporary Croatian society. Current research shows that different parts of the model are validated in the Croatian context. LGB persons who have experienced victimization and discrimination have poorer mental health. Concealing one’s sexual identity does seem to lead to fewer opportunities for victimization and discrimination, but it is also associated with low self-esteem and quality of life. On the other hand, being open about one’s sexual orientation is associated with greater well-being. Being involved and active in the LGB community seems to be the path leading to better visibility and acceptance of LGB’s in the Croatian society. Finally, this paper contributes to the enrichment of minority stress findings by including research on bisexual persons that points to the existence of extra added stress due to double discrimination of bisexual persons by both heterosexual and homosexual persons.",,2015.0,82,3,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'srce.hr', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/239658'}]","Ž Kamenov, A Huić, M Jelić - Kriminologija & socijalna integracija …, 2015 - hrcak.srce.hr","[{'name': 'Ž Kamenov', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8U7O8jYAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=8U7O8jYAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '8U7O8jYAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'A Huić', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RWUknFUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=RWUknFUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'RWUknFUAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Jelić', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wQytnMUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=wQytnMUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'wQytnMUAAAAJ'}]",274,82965379,Željka Kamenov,8732392,Aleksandra Huic,39023157,Margareta Jelić,,,,,,,Psychology,Review

278,"Subject matter: feminism, interiority, and literary embodiment after 1980","I argue that literary texts after 1980 use the fluid relationship between matter and discourse within the literary object itself in order to present alternate versions of the subjectivity and interiority. Examining works by Morrison, Gibson, Acker, Kane, and Jackson, I demonstrate the ways in which these texts revise and reinterpret the dualist division of mind and body by offering bodily metaphors for their character’s interior emotional lives. Taking a cue from recent new materialist scholarship, I argue that these metaphorizations of the body blur the boundaries between the corporeal and the abstract, not simply by granting the body representational agency, but also by proposing that the interiors of subjects, or even metaphors themselves, have unexpected materiality. I emphasize the political implications of the kinds of bodies employed in these metaphors and the representational labor they take on, setting this against the background of the body politics of late twentieth century feminism. I read my primary texts alongside the work of Kristeva, Cixous, Irigary, and others, in order to chart the parallel projects of literature and poststructuralist theory in articulating the relationship between the female body and masculine economies of representation. Starting with the 1980s, when the second wave feminist movement suffered conservative backlash, and continuing through the development of the third wave, I examine literary theorizations of feminist concerns during a period of transition in the feminist movement itself. My first chapter looks at the use of the pregnant body in descriptions of character self-address in Beloved, arguing that Morrison’s deployment of this metaphor challenges damaging descriptions of black maternal corporeality. I supplement my analysis of the novel with Kristeva’s writings on maternity, as well as a contextualizing analysis of the",,2015.0,0,0,0,True,,,,,,278,38367192,J. Lawson,,,,,,,,,,,Art,

It presents three dossiers concerned with the academic work, therapeutic practice and research I have completed over the last three years. The academic dossier consists of three selected essays. The first is a review of an empirical paper about whether a therapist’s conscious identification with a client affects their ability to sense and convey unconditional positive regard. The second essay uses clinical material to argue a case for how I would understand and work with a client diagnosed with borderline personality disorder when practising psychodynamically. The third essay argues that the value base of counselling psychology is compatible with adopting a cognitive behavioural approach to working with clients who have been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. The therapeutic dossier provides an account of the context of practice and the experience I gained in each of the three clinical placements I completed. It also includes my final clinical paper, which reflects on my personal and professional development over the course of my training. Finally, the research dossier consists of a literature review and two pieces of empirical research. The review evaluates empirical literature in order to determine whether there is reason to believe that racism affects the process and outcome of therapy. The first empirical piece is an interpretative phenomenological analysis of minority racial group clients’ experiences of therapy with their white therapists. The second piece is a quantitative study that aimed to develop a measure of minority racial group clients’ perceptions of subtle racism in therapy with their white therapists.

284,Rape Myth Acceptance and Other Barriers to Formally Reporting Sexual Assault Among College Students With and Without Sexual Assault Histories.,"Low rates of reporting sexual assault to law enforcement have been attributed to a culture of rape myth acceptance. Yet, rape myth acceptance rates and specific barriers to reporting have not been examined by sexual assault and reporting histories. This study compared the rape myth acceptance levels of reporting survivors, non-reporting survivors, and individuals without sexual assault histories. The sample consisted of 579 undergraduate students (68.0% White, 72.5% women) at a public university in the southeastern U.S. Differences in non-reporting survivors' experienced barriers to reporting and the perceived barriers of those without sexual assault histories were also examined. Results indicate differences in rape myth endorsement by sexual assault and reporting status, with the highest rape myth adherence rates endorsed by individuals without a sexual assault history and the lowest endorsed by reporting survivors. While non-reporting survivors and those without sexual assault histories shared two of the top three barriers to reporting (i.e., wanted to avoid thinking or talking about it, did not want family or friends to find out), non-reporting survivors were more likely to endorse personal reasons for not reporting, and those without sexual assault histories were more likely to endorse concerns about the law enforcement response to rape. Several barrier factors were identified among non-reporting survivors (i.e., fear of law enforcement involvement, personal reasons, ambiguity of the event, responsibility) and among individuals without sexual assault histories (i.e., risks outweigh benefits, victim blaming, ambiguity). Although both survivors and individuals without sexual assault histories acknowledge the personal, social, and legal risks of reporting a sexual assault to law enforcement, survivors' experienced barriers differed in nuanced ways from the presumed barriers of individuals without sexual assault histories. Findings may enhance sexual assault prevention trainings and awareness campaigns by targeting both rape myth beliefs and specific barriers to reporting of those with and without sexual assault histories.",Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2022.0,26,0,0,False,,,,,,284,112902467,Emma C.

Psychosocial Factors and Mental Health among Muslim Americans. Major Professor: Dr. Ayse Ciftci. Muslim Americans are at risk for experiencing systematic and interpersonal acts of discrimination (Rippy & Newman, 2006). Such experiences of discrimination can lead to the development of depressive symptoms. Thus, it is critical to understand factors that may influence the relationship between experiencing discrimination and developing depressive symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between psychosocial adversities (i.e., perceived discrimination), psychosocial resources (i.e., coping strategies, religious community support) and depressive symptoms. Hypotheses regarding both the relationships among the variables, as well as the mediating role psychosocial resources play in the relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms were assessed. Muslim Americans (N=272) completed the survey, which was distributed online and in person. Using structural equation modeling, results revealed that high levels of perceived discrimination are related to lower levels of coping, which, in turn, are related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. Additionally, high levels of perceived discrimination are related to lower levels of religious community support, which itself is related to higher levels of",,2016.0,119,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'purdue.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2036&context=open_access_dissertations'}]",LN Shawahin - 2016 - search.proquest.com,,290,117488063,Lamise N.

291,A longitudinal examination of cultural risk factors of suicide and emotion regulation.,"The present study is a secondary analysis that tested whether difficulties with emotion regulation (DER) would statistically mediate cultural risk factors of suicide and depression symptoms or suicidal behaviors among (a) Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and (b) lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals. BIPOC (n = 246), and LGBTQ (n = 203) participants completed measures on cultural risk factors of suicide, DER, depression symptoms, and suicidal behaviors at three time points from a larger remote randomized controlled trial (RCT). Simple and parallel mediation explored whether there were indirect effects of cultural risk of suicide on depression or suicidal behaviors via DER. Hypotheses were partially supported: simple mediation revealed that cultural risk factors of suicide at Time 1 predicted only depression symptoms at Time 3 via DER at Time 2 among BIPOC (indirect effect = .09, SE = .04, 95% CI [.01, .17]) and LGBTQ individuals (indirect effect = .05, SE = .02, 95% CI [.02, 08]). Parallel mediation revealed an indirect effect of cultural stressors of suicide and depression via lack of emotional awareness, difficulty with goal-directed behavior, and difficulty accessing emotion regulation strategies for BIPOC, whereas it was via difficulties with goal-directed behavior for LGBTQ persons. With replication, these findings support the importance of cultural risk factors when screening for suicide and inform tailoring of psychosocial interventions targeting emotion regulation with BIPOC and LGBTQ individuals.

This new interpretation of the origins of French absolutism, however, connects the fifteenth-century conciliar reform movement in the Catholic Church to the practice of absolutism by demonstrating that the monarchy appropriated political models derived from canon law. Tyler Lange reveals how the reform of the Church offered a crucial motive and pretext for a definitive shift in the practice and conception of monarchy, and explains how this first French Reformation enabled Francis I and subsequent monarchs to use the Gallican Church as a useful deposit of funds and judicial power. In so doing, the book identifies the theoretical origins of later absolutism and the structural reasons for the failure of French Protestantism.",,2014.0,238,5,0,False,,,,,,293,114486758,Tyler Lange,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

Despite advances, discourses driving sexual expression embody double standards, pathologizing, and silencing. Women’s own experiences are largely ignored in existing literatures. Foucauldian discourse analysis (FDA) is a qualitative methodology rooted in Foucault’s examinations of power and discourse construction. In this FDA, 111 women answered questions about their erotic definitions, experiences, and barriers to expression. Discourses emerging from the data included my own definitions, free but caged, voices of influence, and caution.

297,Promoting racial and ethnic identity: academic intervention to support scholastic success of Latinos,"Latinos are disproportionately faced with societal and educational hardships. As such, it is incumbent upon the education system to offer a method of support that remediates this inequitable reality, particularly when viewed from a Critical Race Theory (CRT) perspective. Research has offered a connection between racial and ethnic identity (REI) and academic success in youth of color, though little research is explicitly connected to Latinos. This study offers a mixed-methods approach to explore the correlation of developing REI in Latino youth through a culturally-responsive school based intervention, cuento (story) group work, and the subsequent increase in REI and academic success. An instrument composed of the Racial Centrality subscale of the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity, Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, and Academic Self-Concept Scale was used preand post-intervention. Additional data sources included an open-ended question on the surveys, session checkout questions, and researcher field notes. Findings indicated an increase in REI among the participants after the eight-week intervention. Although no significant change in academics or relationship between gender and REI development was found, qualitative data offered the presence of potential stereotype threat impacting participant self-perception.",,2017.0,101,0,0,False,,,,,,297,2055442377,Alejandro L.

303,"Barriers to Help Seeking for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive and devastating social problem that is estimated to occur in one of every four opposite-sex relationships and at least one of every five same-sex romantic relationships. These estimates may not represent violence against those who identify as transgender or genderqueer, and very little comprehensive research has been conducted on IPV within these populations. One statewide study on IPV found rates of IPV were as high as one of every two transgender individuals. In order to cope with the effects of abuse or leave an abusive partner, many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and genderqueer (LGBTQ) IPV survivors seek support from others. However, LGBTQ IPV survivors may experience unique difficulties related to their sexual orientation and gender identity when seeking assistance. This article reviews the literature on LGBTQ IPV and suggests three major barriers to help-seeking exist for LGBTQ IPV survivors: a limited understanding of the problem of LGBTQ IPV, stigma, and systemic inequities. The significance and consequences of each barrier are discussed, and suggestions for future research, policy, and practice are provided.","Trauma, Violence, & Abuse",2016.0,122,187,23,False,"Three major barriers to help-seeking exist for LGBTQIPV survivors: a limited understanding of the problem of LGBTQ IPV, stigma, and systemic inequities, and suggestions for future research, policy, and practice are provided.",,,,,303,36050119,Jenna M.

308,Father of all destruction: The role of the white father in contemporary post-apocalyptic cinema,"OF DISSERTATION FATHER OF ALL DESTRUCTION: THE ROLE OF THE WHITE FATHER IN CONTEMPORARY POST-APOCALYPTIC CINEMA Since September 11, 2001 a substantial number of English-language, postapocalyptic films have been released. This renewed interest in the genre has prompted scholars to examine the circumstances within western society that make post-apocalyptic films appealing to audiences. The popularity of these films derives from a narrative structure that reinforces conservative notions of good and bad and moral absolutism. The post-9/11, post-apocalyptic film typically features a white male hero who, in one way or another, reestablishes the pre-apocalyptic social order through proclamations of mandatory and prohibitive laws that must be adhered to by the survivors. The hero of post-apocalyptic film does not present any alternative to the pre-apocalyptic, white masculinist society, but instead appears motivated, if not ordained by narrative, to enforce the pre-apocalyptic rules and mores in a way that disregards the events and circumstances of the apocalypse itself. This dissertation uses psychoanalytic theory, starting with Sigmund Freud and continuing to theorists such as Slavoj Zizek, to investigate the motivations for survivors in post-apocalyptic films to form communities that return to early patriarchy, where prohibitive laws reinforce patriarchal authority through the mandates of the white male father figure.",,2016.0,63,0,0,False,,Book,"[{'title': 'uky.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context=english_etds'}]",F Cosey - 2016 - search.proquest.com,,308,113040696,Felicia Cosey,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

Its main component is made of an episodic buffer and a procedural system that form an executive loop in which processing and storage share domain-general attentional resources on a temporal basis. Because working memory representations decay with time when attention is diverted, the cognitive load of a given activity is the proportion of time during which it occupies attention and prevents it from counteracting this decay through attentional refreshing. Consequently, recall in working memory tasks is an inverse function of the cognitive load of concurrent processing. Besides this system, an independent domain-specific maintenance system exists for verbal, but not visuospatial, information. Within this framework, working memory development mainly results from increasing processing speed that affects both the duration of the distraction of attention by concurrent tasks and refreshing efficiency.",Working Memory,2020.0,63,97,6,True,"The time-based resource-sharing model considers working memory as the workspace in which mental representations are built, maintained, and transformed for completing goal-oriented tasks and results from increasing processing speed that affects both the duration of the distraction of attention by concurrent tasks and refreshing efficiency.",,,,,310,3073105,P.

We use individual micro data to study the trend in intergenerational absolute income mobility measured as the share of sons and daughters earning more than their fathers and mothers, respectively, for eleven Swedish birth cohorts between 1970 and 1980. We find that absolute mobility in Sweden significantly exceeds that of the United States and is largely on par with Canada. The rate of absolute mobility for women exceeds that of men throughout the study period, however the trend has been stronger for men. Using an augmented decomposition model which supplements standard models by accounting for differences in the income distribution of every birth cohort’s parent generation, we find that heterogeneity in the parent income distribution strongly determines how much economic growth contributes to absolute mobility across birth cohorts. If income inequality is high in the parent generation, more growth is required if children that move downward in the relative income distribution are to earn more than their parents.",,2019.0,59,3,0,False,,,,,,313,1391592396,Erik Liss,25475927,Martin Korpi,1917550,Karl Wennberg,,,,,,,Economics,

315,Inequitable Power Comes from and Creates Inequitable Structure: The Continued Relevance of Feminist Theory for Understanding Intimate Partner Violence in Transgender Lives,"Xavier L. Guadalupe-Diaz’s book Transgressed: Intimate Partner Violence in Transgender Lives offers a much-needed addition to research on intimate partner violence (IPV) by exploring trans people’s unique experiences of IPV. The book comes at a significant time when the United States is once again grappling with IPV legislation. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), first passed in 1994, creates and supports programs and resources that address IPV, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. With its reauthorization in 2013, the VAWA was extended to cover men and same-sex couples, and it now prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual identity, or gender identity (in addition to other vital changes). Thus, trans people in the United States now have the right to receive all of the same services as cisgender women and to have their gender identities respected when seeking support for IPV. However, VAWA was not reauthorized by President Trump in 2018 and has lost significant funding for shelters and prevention efforts. Although the funding has diminished, Acting Director of the Office on Violence Against Women Laura Rogers stated that the legal protections in VAWA have not expired (Department of Justice 2020). Unfortunately, as Guadalupe-Diaz demonstrates in Transgressed, these rights have not necessarily translated into actual help. Guadalupe-Diaz uses the stories of eighteen trans survivors of IPV to highlight the distinctive dimensions of IPV for trans people and to point activists and practitioners toward more trans-inclusive policies and practices. The book’s focus on trans survivors makes it a timely addition to the growing field of trans studies within sociology, criminology, and victimology and demonstrates that these fields can no longer rely on cisand heteronormative or binary work. Social science must be intersectional and consider how violence can affect all people, not just cisgender women. Taking a queer and feminist perspective, GuadalupeDiaz seeks meaning from trans people as subjects, not objects of study. He allows the voices of trans people to be heard and to lead his analysis. Overall, this book is accessible and provides a great introduction to the unique features of IPV among trans people. While research on IPV experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people began to expand in the mid-1990s, it has been a slow process and much of this work focused primarily on cisgender lesbian women and cisgender gay men. In 1996, Claire Renzetti and Charles Miley edited a book, Violence in Gay and Lesbian Domestic Partnerships, that Renzetti states marks ‘‘nothing less than a milestone . . . . [and] signifies the growing official recognition of domestic violence within lesbian and gay relationships as a social problem worthy of serious attention and intervention’’ (p. xiii). Similarly, Guadalupe-Diaz’s book, almost a quarter-century later, marks another milestone for IPV research. Although some trans experiences with IPV are similar to those of cis heterosexual women, cis lesbian women, and cis gay men, there are further obstacles that trans people must navigate. In Chapter Three, Guadalupe-Diaz argues these additional obstacles are directly related to genderism and transphobia, just as homophobia and heteronormativity are at the center of the Transgressed: Intimate Partner Violence in Transgender Lives, by Xavier L.

This survey was an exploration of domestic minor sex trafficking knowledge among African American parents and their protective strategies to prevent victimization. Ecological systems theory provided a conceptual framework to examine the environmental factors shaping parental knowledge. The sample consisted of 2 Southern California African American churches (n = 38, n = 32) that served different socioeconomic groups. The African American Sex Trafficking Knowledge survey was researcher designed and pretested by 7 police colleagues. The qualitative data analysis provided sample demographic specifics and associated themes on their knowledge and strategy. Both had basic information about minor sex trafficking, but were unaware of its presence in their communities or the availability of local resources, if needed. Parents believed their children became insulated from victimization because they engaged in protective measures. The social change implications included building and coordinating resources in African American communities with the goal of reducing the high victimization rate of African American children. African American churches as family resource centers could facilitate meaningful parent-child dialogues about sex trafficking. This partnership could initiate innovative preventive programs with community organizations. The outcome could be a model for creating effective culturally-sensitive prevention programs for not only African American families, but also other vulnerable groups.

Methods Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option. Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed. Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre. Results The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge. The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g. Challenged index hamsters consistently infected naïve contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss. All infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre ≥1:427 fourteen days post-challenge. Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology. No consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters.

318,Breaking out of the industry: The independent games movement as resistance to hegemonic videogame discourse,"The aim of this thesis is to examine the way that the videogame industry has evolved as a complex sociotechnological system and how the discourse surrounding the industry, as well as videogames as a medium of expression, has shaped that development. This shift in the nature of videogame creation from individual authors and small studios to the monolithic entity known as ""the Industry"" was accompanied by the creation of an ideology that defines the identity of a community and places constraints on videogames as a medium. This is the ideology of the ""hardcore"" gamer. In order to understand this ideology, its impact and its significance, I will focus on the discourse surrounding the videogame industry and particularly on the limits of this discourse. One such area of discourse where antagonisms arise is in the growing community of independent game developers. The independent games movement can be looked at as a direct result of what Laclau and Mouffe refer to as articulation – the process by which relationships are established in such a way as to alter the identities of the elements themselves. As the videogame industry became increasingly articulated, the identities of games, gamers and game makers became more and more narrowly defined. This increased areas of antagonism within the discourse, allowing for resistance and the possibility of disarticulation. Though the independent games movement has grown substantially in recent years, the degree to which this movement resists the ideology of the videogame industry is unclear, as is the role of the technology in this process. This paper will examine these relationships through the discourse of both the mainstream videogame industry as well as that of the independent games community.",,2013.0,184,3,0,False,,Book,"[{'title': 'core.ac.uk', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276266661.pdf'}]",PA Christiansen - 2013 - search.proquest.com,"[{'name': 'PA Christiansen', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GfkXHgUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=GfkXHgUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'GfkXHgUAAAAJ'}]",318,2056420581,P.

Using OCS data, logistic regression models were used to identify covariates of (≥95%) adequate adherence and mediators and moderators in the association between stress and adherence. Among 307 women, 34.5% and 65.5% had poor and adequate adherence, respectively. Women with poor versus adequate adherence had more reports of hazardous alcohol use, stress events and depressive symptoms. No hazardous alcohol use (aOR=2.20, 95%CI:1.124.32) and fewer stress events (aOR=0.56, 95%CI:0.33-0.94) were associated with increased odds of adequate adherence. The association between environmental stress and adequate adherence was attenuated among women ≤35 years (aOR=0.73, 95%CI:0.56-0.94) versus ≥45 years (aOR=0.51, 95%CI:0.34-0.77).

328,Studying Indian Politics with Large-scale Data: Indian Election Data 1961–Today,"There has been a data revolution in the study of Indian politics in recent years. Indian politics has always been a fascinating field, in comparative perspective and in its own right. Accounts of fieldwork in India have challenged and informed discussions about democracy in the developing world for decades. Since the 1990s, the National Election Studies conducted by Lokniti, CSDS, have enabled informed quantitative analyses of political patterns across the country. More recently, technological innovations and the increasing availability of online data sources have opened the door to new ways of studying Indian politics quantitatively. Scholars can now create and merge a wide range of large-scale datasets, making it possible to establish new empirical trends, fact check commonly held political narratives and test hypotheses developed in other democratic contexts. In this research note, we first describe some techniques and tools used for creating and merging largescale datasets. Next, we introduce two datasets we have developed: constituency-level datasets of Indian State Elections and General Elections from 1961 until today.3 We describe the process of creating these datasets, the efforts involved in cleaning the data and how the data can be utilized. In conclusion, we offer some reflections on the limitations of over-relying on quantitative data in research on Indian politics. We hope to get more scholars and practitioners interested in using the publicly available datasets developed by ourselves and others, and to inspire students and scholars to invest in the quantitative skills needed to develop new quantitative datasets.",,2017.0,14,23,2,True,,,,,,328,98353796,Francesca R.

331,Women and national liberation in South Africa: an oral history perspective,"The historiography of the national liberation struggle in South Africa is dominated by the feats of heroic male activists, in which women’s activism and the impact of the antiapartheid struggle on women and families are largely occluded. The past decade has witnessed the growth of a more inclusive ‘struggle’ historiography due to the mushrooming of women’s biographies and autobiographies. This article is based on interviews with five women whose partners were involved in anti-apartheid activism and who were either banned, forced into exile or incarcerated on Robben Island. Focusing on ‘ordinary’ women who had to see to the subsistence of family and household for extended periods contributes to a more inclusive narrative of anti-apartheid struggles. These gendered biographies highlight the multiple forms of oppression to which women were subjected and their multiple roles in the anti-apartheid struggle, and stress that gender should be a key part of one’s analytical toolbox.",,2015.0,17,1,0,False,,,,"G Vahed - South Asian Diaspora, 2015 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'G Vahed', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u0wkCAgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=u0wkCAgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'u0wkCAgAAAAJ'}]",331,14004897,G.

Indonesian government always encourages the establishment of cooperatives and their number every year has been increasing, but the ones who perform very well are very few. In general, the problems faced are: not implementing the members’ annual meeting every year, bad credits, poor performance, and dormant. The poor performance of the cooperative cannot be separated from the individual performance of the cooperative concerned, whether it is the board or the managers. Therefore, in this study, the researcher tries to empirically examine several factors that influence the individual performance, using five independent variables, namely: control environment, compensation, organizational commitment, motivation and job satisfaction of managers and cooperative managers. Based on the data processing done by using multiple regression analysis techniques, it is found that the variability of the five variables in influencing the individual performance variable as much as 28.2%, simultaneously (F test) of the five variables significantly influence the individual performance of the cooperative, partial only variable of organizational commitment that significantly influences the individual performance of cooperatives in Padang.",,2019.0,3,0,0,False,,,,,,334,2082791638,Ethika Ethika,52271295,Herawati Herawati,119705612,R.

336,A Culturally Based Healing Intervention for Commercially Sex Trafficked Native American Women,"Prostitution, sex-trafficking, and commercial sexual exploitation are terms used to describe a thriving, international black market economy. A substantial portion of research conducted on prostitution has treated women who've experienced sexual exploitation as a homogeneous group, but also demonstrates the diverse experiences of victimization this population may endure as a result of factors including ethnicity. In consideration of this, the present research study conducted interviews to explore the components of a culturally based holistic intervention for Native American women who have experienced commercial exploitation. The author of this study analyzed data from four, semi-structured qualitative interviews with Native American professionals who possess experience working with this population. Six themes emerged from the data including: a) spirituality cannot be separated from the therapeutic inventions, b) ceremony as a diverse, integral component of healing, c) role of community and healing, d) person centered intervention planning, e) and the lack of recognition of traditional healing practices. These findings are consistent with prior research, but also provide valuable information useful for building our current understanding of how to effectively support and facilitate healing from traumatic experiences for this population. Implications from the study for social work practice, policy, education, research are also discussed.

Epidemiologic evidence of this disparity is robust; however, research exploring how and why this disparity persists is sparse. Objective: To refine our understanding of suicidal behavior in adult sexual minority men, with the goal of improving relevant public health strategies to prevent suicide. Methods and aims: Data were drawn from adult sexual minority men who participated in: the population-based Canadian Community Health Survey (N=4675), a gay men’s community-based national online survey (N=7872), and in-depth interviews with men who attempted suicide (N=7). Quantitative bias analysis was used to estimate the degree of misclassification of sexual orientation and associated bias in estimates of suicidal ideation among sexual minority men in general population-based surveys (Aim 1). Structural equation modeling was used to identify specific psychosocial challenges that mediate relationships between constructs of sexual stigma and recent suicide attempts (Aim 2).

342,Marxist or not? Oliver Cromwell Cox on capitalism and class versus “race”,"In Marx’s overall theory of social change he reasoned that the social segment most negatively affected by capitalism was the working class. He felt that it was in the interest of the working class to abolish the system that alienated, exploited, and oppressed them; to overthrow the class that benefitted from their alienation, exploitation, and oppression. Marx’s was thus a class theory of change and this is clearly announced in the opening line of The Communist Manifesto, in which he and Engels affirmed that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle”. More recently, scholars and analysts working in the critical tradition have challenged what they call the class reductionism of Marxism. Known generally as critical race theorists, these scholars criticize Marx and orthodox Marxists for neglecting the central issue of “race”, some even claiming that their theory is incapable of accommodating the question of “race” as a possible rallying cry in the struggle to overthrow capitalism. For these thinkers, “race” is not a mere epiphenomenon and race consciousness is not false consciousness. The two questions I will pursue in this essay are: Can one embrace the notion of race consciousness and still be a Marxist? And, where does Oliver Cromwell Cox stand?",,2014.0,79,2,0,False,,,,"AL Allahar - Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean …, 2014 - Taylor & Francis",,342,88402171,Antón L.

The graffiti served two functions: One, concrete and short-termed, was meant for the eyes of the soldiers and the media, and was constructed as an image event. The second function was the construction of historical commemoration through iconic and inscribed narratives, and was directed exclusively to digital archives on the Internet and private collections. This choice illustrates the deliberate twist of the original essence of graffiti as an anonymous genre, which usually performs in the public sphere into a protest against the desecration of the intimate sphere.

His thriving artistic career has followed an unconventional path, thus challenging the “prerequisite requirement” of the global publishing industry that, according to Om Dwivedi, binds promising authors with a non-Western background together: their coming “from major places which share some connection with British colonialism” (10). Quite the opposite, Khair was brought up in a Muslim family in Gaya, a small town in the backward and remote state of Bihar. He spent the first thirty years of his life in India, where he earned both his BA and MA; then, for purely personal reasons, he decided to move to Copenhagen (not to London or any other Western metropolis), where he broadened his education and gained a PhD in 2000. Given the cross-cultural and religious relevance of Gaya (Buddha’s place of enlightenment as well as an internationally renowned Hindu pilgrimage destination), he grew up “more as a cosmopolitan person” (Dharker 33); hence, as he observes, he “was attracted to the world and [he] was interested in difference” (33).1 Khair has been recently described by Om Dwivedi and Cristina Gàmez-Fernàndez as “a humanist” (xv), as a “socially responsible writer” (xv) who, far from merely entertaining his readers, wishes “to provoke thought and thus augment moral and ethical values in society” (xv). Moreover, the two scholars have emphasized Kahir’s uncompromising rejection of literary labels − postcolonial/ diasporic/ transnational/ postmodern, to name a few − applied to his (or anybody’s) output, as categorizations entail (over)simplifications and restrictions, through the adoption of theoretical lenses that fail to capture the complexity of a work of art, mirroring a multi-faceted and ever-changing reality. In his view, valuable books are those that “make you think anew” (Khair, “Non-Fiction”), by suggesting fresh perspectives, while unsettling deeply ingrained sets of beliefs and assumptions. As he further underlined in the 2011 volume of criticism he wrote with Sebastién Doubinsky, literature “is where we are confronted with the possibilities, problems and limits of language, which are finally also the problems of reality (and representation)” (Khair, Doubinsky 10). Innuendoes, gaps, silence, therefore, are equally important, since “the best writers make the most of not just what can be said but, above all, what cannot be said” (11). Accordingly, the reader 1 Besides, as he mentioned to Gautam Karmakar, he “grew up in an open and religious Muslim family, going to a Roman Catholic school, and surrounded by Hindu friends and neighbours. The idea that one has to show respect to other religions [...] was a lifestyle” (273). Acta_Neophilologica_2019_FINAL.indd 60 16.12.2019 15:00:04 61 An Unwilling Suspension of Misbeliefs envisioned by Khair refuses to stay “on the surface of the text” (Khair, “The Death” 131): by assuming the role of a critic, s/he is an “active thinker and interpreter” (131), who explores the crevices between words and lines and, just like the protagonist of Seamus Heaney’s renowned poem, digs out previously unforeseen alternatives. In recent years, Khair has been engaged in tackling crucial contemporary issues, such as Islamic fundamentalism and xenophobia.2 As this essay sets out to elucidate, in his latest literary endeavour, a short novel entitled Night of Happiness (2018), the author encourages his readers to expose the root of most problems affecting human relationships and, therefore, society as a whole: our unwillingness to embrace the intricacies, the unexpected multiplicity of reality, reassuringly misperceived through the filter of one’s biases and preconceptions, and thus commonly misinterpreted. As will be shown, religious radicalism and discrimination also stem from this core pathology. Narrated by a high-flying entrepreneur, Anil Mehrotra, the narrative explores his increasingly perplexing connection with his right-hand man, Ahmed, regarded as a trustworthy and diligent employee until the incident that triggers the plot. Always cooperative and unpretentious, Ahmed has only ever asked for one day off a year to celebrate Shab-e-baraat, the night of happiness and salvation, a Muslim festival that “links the past to the future” (Khair, Night 15) through the commemoration of the dead. Due to pressing and unexpected business commitments, Ahmed is compelled to work with his boss even on that special occasion. As soon as the most urgent tasks are completed, however, Mehrotra decides to assuage his feelings of guilt by driving Ahmed home, where his wife is supposedly waiting for him to taste the delicious maida ka halwa she has especially prepared for the event. Invited to join them in the feast (even though the lady of the house might not show herself, since she observes strict purdah), Mehrotra is confronted with a most distressing experience: he is served a plate of non-existent halwa, which his host seems to be enjoying immensely, eating from his own empty dish. Furthermore, the conspicuous lock on the front door (signalling the absence of any occupant, before the two men walked in), coupled with the remarkable invisibility of Ahmed’s spouse, suggest that she might also be a figment of his troubled mind. Concerned for the future stability of his company, in the hands of an evidently insane person, the narrator is determined to solve Ahmed’s mystery by hiring a private investigator, who 2 Tabish Khair has released two “sister novels” (Karmakar 279), How to Fight Islamist Terror from the Missionary Position (2012) and Just Another Jihadi Jane (2016), and a philosophical treatise entitled The New Xenophobia (2016). In 2008, some of his essays published between 2001 and 2007 were collected by Renu Kaul Verma in a volume, entitled Muslim Modernities: Tabish Khair’s Essays on Moderation and Mayhem. Acta_Neophilologica_2019_FINAL.indd 61 16.12.2019 15:00:04 62 ElisabEtta Marino gradually uncovers the tragedies of his individual (and collective) past, first of all the ferocious murder of his beloved wife during the Gujarat riots.3 From the very choice of the genre for his novel, Tabish Khair challenges his readers to think beyond conventions and expand their horizons. Depicted by Avantika Mehta as a “literary thriller with a gripping and well-constructed plot” (“Review: Night of Happiness by Tabish Khair”), Night of Happiness actually defies any form of classification, as Mandira Nayar has also pointed out, by viewing it as “part fable, part thriller and part philosophical” (“Night of Happiness: A Serving of Distilled Wisdom from Tabish Khair”). By following the narrator of this “haunting tale” (Mokkil, “The Islamic Factor”) and his line of reasoning, readers gather that appearances may be deceptive, perceptions (even self-perceptions) might prove inaccurate, and simplifications inevitably lead to misunderstandings and mistakes. Indeed, only when the end of the story is reached, can its beginning be thoroughly understood, thus casting a different light on its main characters. The son of a diplomat and a successful manager, Anil Mehrotra belongs to a privileged class, as his PhD from Columbia University, his brand-new Toyota Innova (normally driven by a chauffeur), his iPhone, his golf-club membership, and the fancy party he gives and attends unmistakably testify. He introduces himself as “a man of action” (Khair, Night 42), who takes pride in “thinking logically” (42), while running his “life (and business) on clear lines” (50).4 His most used adjective is probably sensible: he leads a “sensible life” (139, 144), plays golf, a “sensible game” (64), and his marriage is “a sensible one” (75), surely meant to last, since no “deep existential issues” (75) are ever addressed in conversation. The charming family picture sketched by Khair – a refined and cultivated couple with two adorable, cornflakes-eating girls in immaculate school uniform, against the background of a lavishly furnished house5 − is reminiscent of many a scene of delightful domesticity taken from a 1960s Hollywood movie. With his perfectly balanced, successful, and well-organized existence, Mehrotra seemingly epitomizes the virtues of dependability and integrity. Readers are, therefore, persuaded to accept his account of the facts as truthful, while sharing his doubts on Ahmed’s mental sanity, after the unpleasant episode of the invisible 3 As Tabish Khair explains in his novel (126), the 2002 violence was instigated by the death of more than fifty Hindu pilgrims on a train that was seemingly set on fire in Godhra (Gujarat). Returning from Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh), the Hindu pilgrims had taken part in a ceremony at the site where Babri Masjid (a large mosque) used to stand before its demolition (supposedly, the mosque had replaced a pre-existing temple of Rama and, therefore, it had been pulled down). Accused of causing what, later on, turned out to be most likely an accident, the minority Muslim population in Gujarat was persecuted and hundreds were slaughtered. 4 In Mehrotra’s words, his business is “a well-o",,2019.0,2,0,0,True,,,,,,348,8863629,E.

349,"How does the job applicants' ethnicity affect the selection process? : Norms, Preferred competencies and expected fit","The present thesis aimed to study different factors influencing recruiters when recruiting from an applicant pool with applicants from an ethnic ingroup and outgroup. Ethnicity was predicted to influence recruiters’ perception and behaviour in different phases during recruitment. Study I demonstrated that company norms affect recruiters’ perception of what an employee should be like. Company norms, either emphasizing cohesion (employees should “fit in”) or fairness (everybody should be treated equally), were presented to participants. We found an increased focus on Person–Group fit (such as social competence) when norms related to workforce cohesion (company requirement to fit in) were introduced and an increased focus on for Person–Job fit (such as job specific skills and abilities), when fairness norms related to equal opportunity were introduced. The norm effect was moderated by participants’ awareness of the applicants’ ethnicity. When expecting applicants with foreign background, participants in the cohesion condition showed an increased preference for selection methods related to social competence.Study II revealed that outgroup applicants (of Arabic origin) prompt recruiters to focus more on whether they have integrated cultural norms and values fitting the ingroup-norms (Person-Culture fit), as well as the match between the pplicants and their would-be work team (Person-Group fit). When applicants were from the ethnic ingroup, recruiters focused more on questions pertaining to the match between the applicants’ abilities and the specific demands of the job (Person-Job fit). In addition, the study revealed that questions prepared for outgroup applicants were rated as less useful for hireability decisions, and that interview summaries emphasizing PersonJob fit were perceived as more useful.Study III investigated whether increased structure during selection improves the outcome. Participants where either provided with tools for systemizing information about the job and the applicants (structured selection), or no such tools (unstructured selection). We hypothesized and found that a structured process improves the ability to identify job-relevant criteria and leads to the selection of more qualified applicants, even when in-group favouritism is tempting (e.g. when the outgroup applicants are more competent). Increasing structure helped recruiters select more competent applicants. Furthermore, increasing the motivation to carefully follow the structured procedure strengthened these effects. We conclude that structure pays off, and that motivational factors should be taken into account in order for it to have the optimal effect.In all, the findings provide support for the hypotheses that different P-E fit aspects are focused on when recruiters are exposed to outgroup applicants and that structured recruitment leads to an improved ability to identify and select the most competent applicants.

Previous studies have highlighted the personal and collective struggles of this group and emphasized the harmful consequences to physical, emotional and mental well-being of Asian Americans. The current study explored potential factors that may influence the impact of experiencing racial microaggressions for Asian Americans. More specifically, a 2 x 2 betweensubjects factorial design was utilized to examine whether level of familiarity and role of power in the target’s relationship with the perpetrator differentially impacts the experience of a racial microaggression. A vignette illustrated a microaggressive encounter with a perpetrator who differed on these conditions with a sample of 263 Asian Americans. The findings indicate support for the damaging psychological consequences of receiving racial microaggressions with participants reporting significantly negative experience when the perpetrator was someone familiar in a position of authority. The results of the present study contribute to the literature on racial microaggressions by providing support for the injurious impact it has for Asian Americans and continues to challenge the model minority myth that persists to silence their voices and invalidate their racial reality.",,2013.0,152,1,0,False,,,,,,350,30961379,Rachel H.

351,Sexual Safety of Women in the Military Reserve: Perceptions of Threats and Support,"Text: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore perceptions reserve military women have about threats to their sexual safety and the support that they perceive is available to them should they choose to report to a sexual assault or harassment. Descriptive phenomenology provided the philosophical underpinning for this study. Military women represent a group at risk for victimization during their service. Sexual violence within the ranks of the military is a systemic problem. Personal safety is a significant occupational health issue for women in the military. Participants were United States Military women from a variety of military ranks with varied experiences throughout their careers (n=16). Data was collected using digitally recorded semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was done following Colazzi’s six-step method of data analysis. The overarching theme for the study was: military environments differ from civilian environments resulting in military women experiencing a greater sense of risk to their sexual safety and finding it more difficult to get support when they are assaulted or harassed. Four themes supported the overarching theme, military women are vulnerable, men may not follow civilian rules of behavior, the military handles complaints of harassment and sexual assault differently than the civilian work environment, and leaders may be barriers to women experiencing support.

354,"Investing in Women’s Mental Health: Strengthening the Foundations for Women, Families and the Australian Economy","The AHPC policy paper Investing in women's mental health, strengthening the foundations for women, families and the Australian economy discusses the extensive evidence that women's mental health needs are significantly different from those of men. Certain mental illnesses are more prevalent in women, they use mental health services more frequently than men, and they want a broader range of treatment options than are currently available. Mental disorders represent the leading cause of disability and the highest burden of non-fatal illnesses for women in Australia. -43% of Australian women (3.5 million) have experienced mental illness at some time. -Australian women are more likely than men to have experienced symptoms of a mental disorder during the previous 12 months (22% of women compared to 18% of men). -Young women report the highest rates of mental disorder of any population group (30% for women aged 16 to 24). -One in five mothers of children aged 24 months or less are diagnosed with depression. This represents an estimated -111,000 Australian mothers being diagnosed with depression, and 56,000 with perinatal depression annually. -Women are 1.6 times as likely as men to suffer coexisting mental and physical illness. These multimorbidities are associated with increased severity of mental illness and increased disability. -The number of hospital admissions for specialised psychiatric care following a principal diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorders and specific personality disorders was substantially higher for females than males during 2007-08. In 2007-08, females aged 35-44 were the highest consumers of Medicare-subsidised mental health-related GP services (external link). -Women in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have much poorer physical and mental health than other Australians. The suicide rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women is highest within the 20-24 years old age group (21.8 per 100,000), which is more than five times higher than their corresponding non-indigenous counterparts (4.0 per 100,000). The burden of poor mental health amongst women results in adverse social and economic consequences, including disability, reduced life expectancy, impoverishment of individual women, unemployment, reduced productivity, and increasing costs of healthcare and welfare. Women's mental health is influenced by biological, psychosocial, economic and environmental factors. The high prevalence of mental distress amongst women and girls of all ages is bound up in the totality of women's experiences including social and economic inequality. There is an urgent need to counter the gender-blindness of current mental health policy which serves to make these experiences invisible. Policies which reinforce this invisibility are not only ineffective; they are part of the problem. This paper argues that it is time for a new approach aimed at tackling these gendered risks and enhancing protections across the life course.",,2016.0,177,5,1,False,"It is argued that it is time for a new approach aimed at tackling gendered risks and enhancing protections across the life course, including counter the gender-blindness of current mental health policy which serves to make these experiences invisible.",,,,,354,144010988,M.

356,"The Speculative Agency of the Nonhuman: Animal, Object, and Posthuman Worldings","Author(s): Magnone, Sophia Booth | Advisor(s): Freccero, Carla | Abstract: This dissertation explores representations of nonhuman agency across the diverse literary tradition of speculative fiction. I identify speculative fiction as a site where cultural discourses of personhood, species, and power might be challenged and reworked; a loosely defined genre, SF insists on an openness to disruption, exploiting the creative and politically radical possibilities of imagining the world otherwise. The project draws upon an archive of nineteenth- and twentieth-century French, English, and U.S. American texts that adopt a speculative mode in order to literalize long-standing associations of the feminine, animal, and object in the Western patriarchal imagination, populating their pages with figures of feminized cyborgs, animalized women, and mechanized animals. By worlding a range of beings defined by their difference from the human norm, the texts intervene in longstanding anthropocentric discourses of “who” versus “what,” proposing a more inclusive notion of personhood that recognizes collective, interdependent, and passive forms of agency. I draw upon feminist theory, gender and queer theory, animal studies, and posthumanist scholarship to articulate an intersectional approach to multispecies ethics.The four chapters separate into two parts, each concerned with one vector of the infinitely multiple field of the nonhuman. The first two focus on artificial, machinic life as one alternative to human species-being; Rachilde’s Monsieur Venus in Chapter 1 and Villiers’s L’Eve future and Carter’s The Passion of New Eve in Chapter 2 employ cyborg figures to challenge dominant discourses of gender propriety and authorial agency. The second two chapters focus on animals and animality as a second alternative to humanity; Carter’s Nights at the Circus and Darrieussecq’s Truismes in Chapter 3 and Stapledon’s Sirius and Bakis’s Lives of the Monster Dogs in Chapter 4 attend to the perils and pleasures of bestial life on the margins of human-dominated society. Together, the chapters build toward a notion of worlding as collaboration—between humans, animals, and machines; between genders; between storytellers and stories, authors and texts.",,2016.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,356,119181420,S.

359,Reviewing the critics: Examining popular video game reviews through a comparative content analysis,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current critical climate in popular online video game reviews (i.e., video game criticism written for a general audience). So far, most of the research published in this area focuses on how the reviews reflect the games themselves, rather than strictly examining the content of the reviews in this growing body of literature. This study uses computer-aided text analysis (CATA) supplemented with human coding to identify typological differences between film and video game reviews, as well as differences in theory usage and critical thought and style. Video game reviews are more concerned with the price of the work being reviewed, supporting the notion for a utility theory of video games. Game reviewers also tend to find redeeming qualities even in very flawed games, suggesting they are either overly passionate and/or concerned about keeping advertisers happy. Although not at the exceedingly high levels as previous studies, the author finds support for using usability heuristics (e.g., responsiveness of controls, use of in-game tutorials) to review games. Neither body of popular criticism examined delves deeply into theoretical frameworks for auteur or feminist theories, but discussion is provided as to how the reviewers could address these issues should they choose to do so.",,2013.0,61,1,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'ohiolink.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=csu1377089044&disposition=inline'}]",B Gifford - 2013 - rave.ohiolink.edu,,359,114025347,B.

362,Handling the Past: Using a Specialized Curriculum to Facilitate Narration of Racial Identities,"Identity construction takes place where people spend significant amounts of time. For children, those areas include home and school. Evidence exists that Black children are not given opportunities in school to narrate and affirm their racial identities. Racial identity has been shown to affect school success (Carter, 2008; Lea, 2014; Murrell, 2007), political involvement (Diemer and Li, 2011), and psychological well-being (Seaton, Sellers, & Scottham, 2006). Scholars suggest using history, narration, and dialogue to address this problem; however, current research has yet to incorporate these suggestions. I used a critical action research methodology to explore the influence of a specialized curriculum, document student engagement in critical race discourse, and facilitate the racial identity narrations of fourteen Black fifth-grade students. Targeted digital materials containing affirming Black historical portraits were used as springboards to teacher-facilitated conversations about race and subsequent student written reflections. Qualitative analysis was applied to students’ reflections after viewing and discussing the digital materials, students’ answers to direct questions regarding their racial attitudes, researcher observations, and researcher reflections. The findings suggest that students (1) had a severely limited knowledge of Black history and desired to learn more, (2) further developed affirming Black racial identities despite the historical challenges of Black people and despite personal contemporary problems, (3) were nonjudgmental regarding actions that their Black collective group exhibited regarding agency and subsistence, and (4) held exclusionary attitudes toward White people while suggesting the need for various races and cultures to spend time together. Implications for teachers, teacher educators, policy makers, book publishers, and curriculum developers are discussed.

363,The role of job stress and phychological capital on the relationship between interpersonal mistreatment and individual job outcomes,"Detrimental effects of interpersonal mistreatments at workplace have drawn unprecedented attention of researchers over the last couple of decades. This research is an attempt to fulfill the gap by examining western theories of interpersonal mistreatments in non-western settings. This research examined major (sexual harassment and workplace ostracism) and minor (workplace incivility) interpersonal mistreatments categories together with the underlying mechanism and consequences. Besides that, the mediated role of job stress with interpersonal mistreatments and their job outcomes (job burnout and turnover intention) was also studied. In addition, this research studied the coping mechanism of job stress by examining psychological capital as a moderator in relationship between job stress and job outcomes. A three wave study design was employed in the research. Multistage sampling technique was applied whereby the respondents were 1850 employees from the telecom sector in Pakistan. In the final wave, 523 responses from the same respondents were used in the analysis. Correlation, regression and structural equation modeling were used for data analysis. Findings suggested that interpersonal mistreatments were positively related to job stress, job burnout and turnover intentions. Job stress has been shown to partially mediate between interpersonal mistreatments and job outcomes. Moreover, results suggested that the relationship between job stress and job burnout was weakened when psychological capital was high. Similarly, the relationship between job stress and employee turnover intention weakened when psychological capital was high. This research generalizes the findings of western theories on interpersonal mistreatments in the non-western culture (Pakistan) and suggests that psychological capital be applied as a strong personal resource to cope with workplace stressors and stress related job outcomes.",,2016.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,363,2096757839,I.

364,"'‘Male Chauvinism’ Is Under Attack from All Sides at Present': Roberts v. United States Jaycees, Sex Discrimination, and the First Amendment","Today, many take it for granted that discriminating against women in the marketplace is illegal and morally wrong. Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) remains a foundational case on government’s compelling interest in prohibiting sex (or gender) discrimination in public accommodations, even in the face of First Amendment claims of freedom of association and expression. Curiously, Jaycees seems comparatively neglected by legal scholars, if measured by the cases included in the various collections of “law stories” or “rewritten opinions” projects. Looking back at the Jaycees litigation reveals the parties wrestling over the reach of public accommodations law and the force of the race discrimination-sex discrimination analogy. The parties and their amici invoked NAACP v. Alabama (1957), a significant root of the constitutional right to freedom of association, in strikingly different ways, and strenuously disagreed about how to compare the Jaycees to the NAACP. How did the parties frame the evident conflict between promoting sex (or gender) equality—women’s full participation in society—and protecting freedom of association? What was at stake for women in being excluded from full membership in organizations, like the Jaycees and all-male private clubs, that provided members an entree to the “Old Boys Network”? What was at stake for the Jaycees and similar organizations in a climate in which (as one amicus put it) “‘male chauvinism’ is under attack from all sides”? In Jaycees, even as the Supreme Court elaborated upon the values advanced by the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of association, it upheld the application of Minnesota’s public accommodations law to the Jaycees’s exclusion of women from regular membership despite the Jaycees’s freedom of speech and association claims. Both aspects of Jaycees live on, as was evident in arguments made in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission that related sexual orientation discrimination to other forms of “invidious” discrimination that government may prohibit. This article argues that the relationship between freedom of association and gender equality is double-edged. It concludes by returning to the present day, asking whether the Old Boys Network is simply a relic of the past or has continuing potency. It reflects on some present-day controversies over freedom of association and single-sex organizations.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2019.0,33,3,1,True,,,,,,364,46174107,L.

367,When girls turn into men and boys into women : a postfeminist reading of The Last of Us and BioShock,"This study explores the ways in which certain societal anxieties regarding femininity and masculinity surface in post-apocalyptic video games BioShock (2007 2K Games) and The last of us (2013 Naughty Dog). A postfeminist perspective is employed in order to explore the privileging of so-called ‘masculine values’ in late neo-liberal societies, and the subsequent negation of the (seemingly) binary opposite of stereotypical femininity. This explorative study is situated within a broad framework of postfeminism, and focuses on providing alternative understandings of the representation of gender in video games. By considering video games as a medium that is firmly rooted in traditional masculinity, I argue that anxieties regarding the subordination of so-called ‘feminine values’ in society as a whole, manifest visually in BioShock and The last of us, in both the gameplay as well as in narrative structure. In an attempt to gain a better understanding of how these anxieties surface, I explore the ways in which a disillusionment with ‘masculine values’ become evident in the post-apocalyptic settings of the two games under discussion . This study aims to highlight the ways in which BioShock and The last of us attempt to subvert normative constructions of masculinity, and instead posit feminine values as positive, desirable and necessary in order to acknowledge and realise a broader sense of ‘being human’; one that does not depend on culturally sanctioned notions of gender.

368,Child rights-based approach to child health,"The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is 30 years old. The CRC defines five domains; economic, cultural, social, protective and civil and political. There are three principals of child rights; universality, interdependency and accountability. Goldhagen J et al. [BMJ Paediatrics Open 2020;4:e000589. doi:10.1136/bmjpo-2019-000589] has defined these tenets in terms of social justice and health equity. The CRC and these childrights principles establish the structure and function of a child rightsbased approach (CRBA) to child health and wellbeing. It is worthwhile exploring this paper and to consider whether you practice a CRBA in your daily work and ask yourself how you can achieve a CRBA. The paper orientates the reader to the historical context of child rights based approaches to child health. It identifies past challenges to CRBAs to child health and illustrates examples of programmes and initiatives that have responded to these challenges. It defines a new paradigm for the practice of paediatrics and child health that is grounded in these principles, standards and norms of child rights, social justice and equity. It reminds us of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs). How do we advance Childrens’ rights into the healthcare setting? There are ten priorities for the realisation of child rights and implementation of a CRBA. The paper explains how we can monitor and evaluate our efforts. They have presented a new term and abbreviation for the Archivist; the structure, process and outcomes (SPO) approach to evaluation along with a number of suggested appropriate evaluation indicators. Structural indicators should demonstrate legislation, policies and strategies to ensure the highest standards of health and wellbeing. They should provide minimum guarantees in terms of access to quality healthcare, including refugee, immigrant, ethnic minority children and policy commitments to guarantee an adequate standard of living and protection from all forms of violence. Can you influence this locally or nationally? Can you advocate for an accessible and effective complaint mechanism, using children’s ombudspersons or commissioners. Process indicators assess progress in transforming budgetary allocations for child health, ensuring marginalised children have access to services, and a proportion of children covered by health insurance and access to affordable housing and social security, and effective enforcement of child protection legislation. Outcome indicators should capture the individual and collective results of the measures put into place by the State. These outcomes should include rates of mortality, obesity, youth suicide and violence against children. There should be every effort made to explore the perceptions from children about how they experience the realisation of their rights. Listen to children and young adults. The authors conclude that ‘Child health professionals have important roles to play in response to the global challenges to child health and wellbeing. Knowledge of the principles of child rights and experience with applying a CRBA to clinical practice, systems development and policy formulation will provide them the tools required to fulfil the rights of all children to optimal survival and development.’ Think on.",Archives of Disease in Childhood,2020.0,0,0,0,False,"The paper orientates the reader to the historical context of child rights based approaches to child health and defines a new paradigm for the practice of paediatrics and child health that is grounded in these principles, standards and norms of childrights, social justice and equity.",,,,,368,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,JournalArticle
369,Game Balance: Designed structure and consumer agency in an online game,"Massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs) attract millions of people every year and are now a major industry. Using the internet, these games connect players and give them goals to pursue within virtual worlds. This thesis examines the early life of one such game, the North American version of TERA, based on participant observation on a player vs. player server. TERA’s players met and interacted within a virtual game world controlled by the company which developed the game, and although players constructed their own social groups and factions within this world they were constrained by software that they could not change. Everything from the combat rules to the physics of the environment was designed, and players could only take actions that were accounted for and allowed by that design.  However, TERA launched as one of many available MMORPGs which were competing for the attention of the same audience. Its players tended to be experienced and well-informed about the genre, and used their knowledge to evaluate and critique TERA both privately and in public forums. Aware that game companies’ chief concern was for profit, players exercised agency by embracing a consumer identity and pressuring developers in their own commercial terms. To retain players’ loyalty and continue receiving their fees, companies were obliged to appease their customers. This allowed players to see the game world develop and change in accordance with their desires despite the fact that they lacked the access or the expertise to change it themselves. I link this approach to agency to the rise of consumer movements in capitalist societies, and show how the virtual world of TERA can serve as an example for other situations in the physical world where contemporary technologies are used to both enable and constrain agency.",,2013.0,63,0,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'wgtn.ac.nz', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Game_Balance_Designed_structure_and_consumer_agency_in_an_online_game/17005030/1/files/31457314.pdf'}]",E Haynes - 2013 - openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz,,369,145674799,Elizabeth Haynes,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

La question de la discrimination a raison de l'apparence physique (poids, taille, attractivite generale, tenue vestimentaire, coiffure, allure generale, hygiene, piercings ou de tatouages, ...) ou le lookisme, dans l'entreprise repond a un probleme a la fois juridique social, ethique et psychologique et de marketing, a l'envergure historico-globale. Les stereotypes se traduisent indeniablement dans le marche du travail (notamment aux niveaux du recrutement, la remuneration, la promotion et le licenciement).

Bower Old Dominion University, 2016 Dissertation Chair: Dr. Jeffry Moe The Transgender Ally Identity Scale for Counselors (TAISC) is a 35-item scale measuring counselors’ ally identity for working with transgender individuals. The purpose of the current study was to develop and initially validate the TAISC. Using a non-experimental survey design, the scale was developed (i.e., item development, external review, pilot study) and validation analyses were performed (i.e., exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, validity, and social desirability analyses). Electronic data were collected from a nationwide sample of counseling students, professional counselors, and counselor educators (N=285). Participants completed a survey packet consisting of the TAISC, Multicultural Counseling Knowledge and Awareness Scale (MCKAS; Ponterotto et al., 2002), Genderism and Transphobia Scale – Revised –Short Form (GTS-R-SF; Tebbe et al., 2014), Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability Scale – Short-Form C (MCSDS-C; Reynolds, 1982) and a demographic information form. A two-factor model was determined to be the best fit for the sample, accounting for approximately 37% of the total variance. The internal consistency estimate was acceptable for the TAISC total scale (α = .94). Additionally, the TAISC was significantly, positively correlated with the MCKAS (Ponterotto et al., 2002) and significantly, negatively correlated with the GTS-R-SF (Tebbe et al., 2014) supporting convergent validity. Although further validation analyses are needed, initial results support the use of the TAISC in measuring transgender ally identity of counselors.",,2016.0,116,1,0,False,,,,,,372,144531311,J. D.

376,Hiding in Plain Sight: How Binary Gender Assumptions Complicate Efforts to Meet Transgender Students' Name and Pronoun Needs.,"Existing literature about transgender college students calls upon higher education organizations to support trans students’ use of self-identified first names (in place of legal names, given at birth) and self-identified pronouns (in place of assumed pronouns based on sex assigned at birth, or other’s perceptions of physical appearance), but that literature lacks guidance on how to achieve this work, which is deceptively complex. This study addressed this gap in the literature in two ways. First by using critical theory to show how hegemonic, binary notions of gender shape intellectual, social, and regulatory dimensions of higher education in ways that complicate practitioners’ efforts to provide trans students with support. Second, by using institutional ethnography (IE) as a critical framework and methodology to uncover what IE refers to as texts and relations that operate in unintended ways to undo practitioners’ efforts to provide desired supports. I use examples from my experience as a higher education LGBTQ resource professional at the University of Vermont (UVM) to add depth to my analysis and present the results in two articles. The first article presents the rationale for changing campus information systems to enable transgender students to use self-identified names and pronouns on campus, and presents examples of the work accomplished at the University of Vermont and the University of Michigan. The second article extends beyond logistics to explore the complex questions that are the focus of this dissertation.",,2017.0,89,0,0,False,,,,,,376,81185596,Dot Brauer,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

There is a consensus that breastfeeding has widespread health benefits for infants, mothers, and society. But socio-historical factors unique to African Americans have been largely overlooked. These are events, experiences, and other phenomena that have been culturally, socially, and generationally passed down and integrated into families, potentially influencing breastfeeding beliefs and behaviors. The goals of this study are to describe cultural factors influencing African American mothers’ perceptions of infant-feeding decisions and to identify possible connections between these socio-historical factors and African American infant-feeding outcomes. I conducted six focus groups, three breastfeeding groups and three formula-feeding groups, in May 2015 through September 2015. The groups were constructed using a purposeful sampling of African American mothers stratified by age—18–29, 30–50, and 51+. I used MAXQDA computer software to conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on the findings. This study’s findings suggest that an examination of the socio-historical factors of breastfeeding disparities may illuminate key areas that can be targeted for the development of culturally sensitive interventions to improve African American breastfeeding outcomes.",,2016.0,151,2,0,False,,,,,,377,1402678151,Stephanie Devane-Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

381,Urban High School Climate: Students’ Perceptions of Bullying and Homophobic Remarks in School,"Implications of bullying and homophobic remarks heard in school can be harmful to students and create an unsafe school environment. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth are often targets of negative and derogatory comments (GLSEN, 2009). This paper defines homophobic bullying, specifically in school settings, and addresses key issues. Several issues researched in this paper include; the implications of harassment, absenteeism, academics, and the roles of personal characteristics of students who heard homophobic remarks in schools. The research addresses the significance of students who report victimization of negative and harmful remarks. Resiliency and risk factors of students are essential issues addressed in an effort to understand the overall effects of homophobic bullying and negative remarks heard in schools. Finally, the paper addresses the importance of continued proactive efforts to reduce and eliminate bullying and homophobia in schools. Key Terms: Homophobia, Homophobic Bullying, LGBT, GLSEN, Risk Factors & School Climate BULLYING AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS IN SCHOOLS 8 List of Figures Figure 1: Cronbach’s Alpha Case Summary Log ....................................................................33 Figure 2: Safe Space Logo ..........................................................................................................44 Figure 3: Hypothesis Model .......................................................................................................55 BULLYING AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS IN SCHOOLS 9 Bullying and Homophobic Remarks in Schools Inequalities, social exclusion and discrimination negatively impact the health, well-being and achievement of children and young people (Social Exclusive Unit, 2011). Clear links have been identified between children’s and young people’s experiences of education and schooling, and their achievements, socio-economic position and health as adults (Acheson, 1998). Homophobic harassment and bullying are two behaviors that can negatively affect students’ experiences (GLSEN, 2009). During the last two decades, there has been an increasing awareness of the need to address bullying among young people in and out of school settings (Acheson, 1998). In addition, in recent years there has been growing concern about the impact of homophobia and homophobic bullying on children’s and young people’s physical and emotional well-being and on their attendance and achievement at school (Rivers, 2000). Schools today are not only facing the challenge of recognizing bullying, but also what efforts can be taken to reduce bullying incidents. Hostile acts are often perpetrated against racial and ethnic minorities, gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual youth, and persons with disabilities (American Psychological Association, 2005). Bullying targeted toward gay, lesbian and questioning youth can have adverse effects to a student’s social emotional growth (GLSEN, 2009). In response to widespread professional and public concern about the harmful effects of bullying in schools, many school systems have adopted measures to educate and prevent bullying among students. Recent activities to protect children and adolescents from bullying have been undertaken by both schools and national policies. The objectives of these programs are to provide a safe environment while at the same time enriching the children’s emotional, physical and educational welfare. The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program and the “That’s So Gay” national advertising campaign, in conjunction with recent studies are two programs that can promote awareness of BULLYING AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS IN SCHOOLS 10 homophobic bullying. Two major studies reviewed in this paper are the 2009 Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network study and the 2006 Safe Schools of North Carolina study. The paper covers homophobic bullying and harassment in schools, the physical, emotional and behavioral effects of hearing homophobic remarks in schools and school climate. Bullying and Homophobia Bullying is a common and evident problem in schools. To begin to understand the effects of homophobic remarks heard in schools, and specifically homophobic bullying, bullying and homophobia must be defined. In an effort to build a safe school environment, bullying and homophobic remarks of youth who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning, must be eliminated. A bullying researcher, Dan Olweus, stated “A person is bullied when he or she is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons, and he or she has difficulty defending him or herself (p.9).” In accordance with his definition, Olweus believed that bullying is: (a) an aggressive behavior that involves unwanted, negative actions; (b) a pattern of behavior repeated over time; and (c) an imbalance of power or strength (Olweus, 2010). Coloroso (2003) defined bullying as “a conscious, deliberate hostile activity intended to terrorize and harm others through the threat of further aggression” (p. 13). The aggression can manifest itself in many forms, primarily: physically, verbally and socially. There are nine key forms of bullying: (1) social exclusion or isolation; (2) physical (such as hitting, kicking, shoving, and spitting); (3) lies and false rumors; (4) having money or other things taken or damaged; (5) being threatened or being forced to do things; (6)racial; (7) sexual; (8) cyber (via cell phone or Internet), and (9) verbal, including derogatory comments and bad names (Olweus). BULLYING AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS IN SCHOOLS 11 Farrington (1993) described bullying as “repeated oppression, psychological or physical, of a less powerful person by a more powerful one” (p. 381). In an effort to define homophobia, Mihalik believed that understanding the definition of heterosexism, in comparison to homophobia, was necessary. He defined homophobia as any belief system that supports negative myths and stereotypes about homosexual people, or any of the varieties of negative attitudes that arise from fear or dislike of homosexuality (1991). Homophobia is an irrational fear of, or aversion to, homosexuals and homosexuality. People who have homophobic attitudes react to homosexuals as enemies to be feared, hated, and actively repressed (Mihalik). He described heterosexism as a belief system that values heterosexuality as superior to, and/or more natural than, homosexuality. Others defined homophobia as any negative attitudes toward homosexuality existing on a continuum, from homophobia to heterosexism (Berkman & Zinberg, 1997). Heterosexism does not acknowledge the existence of non-heterosexuals (Mihalik). People with heterosexist beliefs react to homosexuals as unfortunate, devalued individuals (Mihalik). Mihalik described homophobia as being a suppressed and feared ideology where the positive valence of “us"" and the negative valence of ""they"" has been the basis for stigmatizing someone with homosexual beliefs, as a person to be feared and hated (1991). The philosophy behind homophobia can manifest itself in two relevant modes; internal and external. Internal homophobia is a learned bias that individuals, including LGBT, incorporate or internalize into their belief system (Community University Institute for Social Research, 2003). External homophobia is an overtly observed or experienced expression of internal biases, such as social avoidance, verbal abuse, and civil discrimination (Community University Institute for Social Research). Elements of internal and external homophobia, such as internalizing verbal abuse and BULLYING AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS IN SCHOOLS 12 social avoidance, show a relationship to institutional and cultural homophobia. Institutional homophobia, or heterosexism, refers to the many ways that governments, businesses, churches, educational institutions, and other organizations and institutions discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation (Community University Institute for Social Research). Cultural homophobia refers to social standards and norms that dictate that being heterosexual is better or more moral than being GLB, and that everyone is (or should be) heterosexual (Community University Institute for Social Research). The negative outcomes of students’ experiences of institutional or cultural discrimination often make it difficult for students to self-advocate (Community University Institute for Social Research). A study conducted by the University of London’s Thomas Corwin Research Unit emphasized that homophobic bullying can take a number of forms: name calling or verbal threats, forms of sexual harassment (such as being inappropriately touched), being continually ignored (due to one’s perceived sexuality) and physical violence – sometimes slight, and on other occasions, extreme (D’Augelli & Rivers, 2001, Kimmel & Mahler, 2003, Kosciw, 2004, & Rivers & Ryan, 2003). Homophobic and other negative remarks, coupled with the repetition of those remarks, can be harmful to students. The term “homophobia” was first defined by Weinberg (1972) to mean “irrational fear, hatred, and intolerance of homosexual men and women” (Cogan & Erickson, 1999). Fyfe (1983) defined homophobia as “any negatives attitudes and reactions toward homosexuals” (p. 549). The harassment suffered as a result of bullying can create difficulties for adolescents’ emotional and social states of being. Homophobic bullying in schools. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) youth often experience bullying and harassment in the school environment. Evidence suggests that students who either identify as or BULLYING AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS IN SCHOOLS 13 are perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) experience a negative school climate such as bullying, harassment, sexual harassment, discrimination, teasing (D’Augelli, Pilkington, & Hershberger, 2002; Kosciw, Diaz, & Greytak, 2008).

382,"Exploring the Middle Eastern American Students’ College Experience: Adjustment, Discrimination, and Coping","Author(s): Modir, Sheila | Advisor(s): Kia-Keating, Maryam | Abstract: Experiences of perceived prejudice and discrimination are prevalent in the Middle Eastern American community (Arab American Institute, 2015), and these rates have only increased since September 11th, 2001 (Rousseau, Hassan, Moreau, a Thombs,2011). However, little is known about how such experiences influence the Middle Eastern American emerging adulthood population, despite the importance of this critical developmental period (Arnett, 2000). Given past findings that discrimination can negatively impact ethnic minority college adjustment across social, academic, and emotional domains (Carter, Locks, a Winkle-Wagner, 2013), it is important to understand the interrelationships of discrimination experiences, coping, and college adjustment specifically for Middle Eastern Americans. The current study explored experiences of discrimination, microaggressions, coping, and college adjustment through in-depth interviews with 25 Middle Eastern American first- year and second-year undergraduate college students. Participants were recruited from a public university with a mean age of 18.72 and a sample of 7 men and 18 women of diverse Middle Eastern heritage. Of the 25 participants, 15 were first-year undergraduate students and 10 were second-year undergraduate students. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded using grounded theory. This process allowed for the in-depth exploration and theory generation that is particularly important when conducting research with a population underrepresented in the literature. Study findings resulted in a theoretical model of how discrimination influenced college adjustment across multiple socio-ecological levels: (a) societal: climate and context, (b) community: discrimination and sense of belonging, (c) relationships and self: family, peers, and coping, and (d) individual: college adjustment. Results suggested that discrimination experiences were critical components to consider in the matter of Middle Eastern American students’ college persistence, and the findings carried a number of clinical implications for working with these college students on an institutional, interpersonal, and individual level.",,2016.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,382,16088108,Sheila Modir,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

V(r) and hence the protein–protein distances and the phase boundary of the LLPS region strongly depend on the polymer-to-protein size ratio and the polymer concentration. The strongest effect is observed for small-sized PEG molecules, leading to a marked decrease of the mean intermolecular spacing of the protein molecules with increasing crowder concentration.

Of particular note is the frequency of references to alcohol; 21% of the 1,000-song sampling frame contained alcoholic references, and the average for the final five-year period (2009-2013) was 1.01 references per song. This research should serve as a springboard into further studies about the lyrical content of pop songs as well as longitudinal changes.",,2014.0,114,0,0,False,,,,,,389,2057359211,Keith Evans,,,,,,,,,,,History,
390,Changes in Glucose Control and Lipid Levels Following Trunk-Based Body Contouring Surgery in Postbariatric and Nonbariatric Patients,"Abstract Background Despite consistent interest over the past 2 decades regarding the metabolic effects of body contouring (BC), previous studies are limited by short follow-up periods, small sample sizes, gender-specific cohorts, and assessment of all anatomic regions together. Objectives This study evaluates the changes in glucose and lipid levels over long-term follow up after trunk-based BC and compares postbariatric with nonbariatric patients. Methods The retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent trunk-based BC from January 1, 2009 through July 31, 2020 at West Virginia University. A minimum 12-month follow up was required for inclusion. With BC surgery as the reference point, patients' glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid levels were assessed prior to surgery and at long-term follow up. Change over time was compared between postbariatric and nonbariatric cohorts. Multivariable linear regression models were performed to assess the effect of potential confounding variables on the difference between cohorts. Results Seventy-seven BC patients had glucose levels evaluated during the study period, and 36 had lipid profiles obtained. Average follow up from date of BC was 41.2 months for the patients with glucose follow up and 40.9 months for those with lipid levels. From pre-BC to endpoint follow up, glucose levels mildly increased in all patients. Multivariable linear regression models accounting for age showed nonbariatric patients experience significantly improved total cholesterol levels compared to postbariatric patients (P = 0.0320). Weight loss maintained following BC was not associated with significant differences between cohorts. Conclusions Fasting glucose levels marginally increase in most BC patients through follow up. Nonbariatric patients generally experience more favorable changes in lipid profile following trunk-based BC than do postbariatric patients.

393,The invisible made visible through technologies’ agency: a sociomaterial inquiry on emergency remote teaching in higher education,"ABSTRACT We are used to considering human agency as the most important aspect of the educational process. Technologies are seen as inert matter, subordinated to human intention and design, as if they did not have a role in the eclectic combination of teaching, learning, and knowing about the world. Their agency is invisible until a breakdown occurs, a material moment which shows their doing. In this paper, we make digital action visible by focusing on emergency remote teaching in higher education during the Covid-19 pandemic breakdown. Data were collected/co-created in a graduate course in Education in the first three months of lockdown in Brazil. Through a queer assemblage of teaching-researching-writing, we present a sociomaterial analysis that shows multiple entanglements of bodies, material things, and pedagogic time-spaces. In this exercise, social inequality issues, power structures and ethical problems come to the surface, while students struggle for quality participation in the digitised classes.",Journal of Educational Media,2021.0,80,13,1,False,,,,,,393,2089159452,Magda Pischetola,2125667726,Lyana V.

394,Beyond Strong and Weak: Rethinking Postdictatorship Civil Societies1,"What is the impact of dictatorships on postdictatorial civil societies? Bottom-up theories suggest that totalitarian dictatorships destroy civil society while authoritarian ones allow for its development. Top-down theories of civil society suggest that totalitarianism can create civil societies while authoritarianism is unlikely to. This article argues that both these perspectives suffer from a one-dimensional understanding of civil society that conflates strength and autonomy. Accordingly we distinguish these two dimensions and argue that totalitarian dictatorships tend to create organizationally strong but heteronomous civil societies, while authoritarian ones tend to create relatively autonomous but organizationally weak civil societies. We then test this conceptualization by closely examining the historical connection between dictatorship and civil society development in Italy (a posttotalitarian case) and Spain (a postauthoritarian one). Our article concludes by reflecting on the implications of our argument for democratic theory, civil society theory, and theories of regime variation.",American Journal of Sociology,2014.0,327,28,0,True,"It is argued that totalitarian dictatorships tend to create organizationally strong but heteronomous civil societies, while authoritarian ones tends to create relatively autonomous but organizationally weak civil societies.",,,,,394,33101928,Dylan Riley,145195135,Juan J.

(Jyväskylä Studies in Education, Psychology and Social Research ISSN 0075-4625; 599) ISBN 978-951-39-7249-3 (nid.) ISBN 978-951-39-7250-9 (PDF) Synchrony, or the moment-by-moment coordination between people in social situations, has been connected with increased liking and rapport. However, this type of synchrony is an underexplored area with regard to autonomic nervous system activity. The purpose of this research was to study physiological synchrony between participants in couple therapy by focusing on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which reflects arousal and emotional reactions. The data comprised 12 couple therapy cases (24 clients, 10 therapists) participating in the Relational Mind in Events of Change in Multiactor Therapeutic Dialogues (2013-2016) research project. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate were recorded from the clients and therapists at the start and at the end of the therapy. The aim of the research was threefold: to study the physiological reactions and synchrony that can be observed between participants in couple therapy, to analyze whether the levels of EDA synchrony change throughout the therapy processes, and to assess whether the possible changes in EDA synchrony are related to the therapeutic alliance or the therapy outcome. The results showed that between the participants of couple therapy, significant SNS synchrony occurred, which was not due merely to chance or to the presence of similar features within the therapy sessions. At the start of the therapy, the couples had the lowest level of SNS synchrony, whereas the co-therapists had the highest synchrony. The only significant SNS changes observed were in the couples, whose mutual synchrony increased towards the end of the therapy. The changes in SNS synchrony between the couples, and between the clients and the therapists, mostly showed a positive relationship with the increasing alliance and with the clients’ better wellbeing – although one specific pattern of decreasing synchrony seemed to be beneficial. The results highlight the role of embodiment in human interaction, and assist in understanding the healing mechanisms of therapy.",,2017.0,49,8,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'jyu.fi', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://jyx.jyu.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/55925/Karvonen_Anu_screen.pdf?sequence=1'}]","A Karvonen - Jyväskylä studies in education, psychology and social …, 2017 - jyx.jyu.fi",,395,2063989558,Anu Karvonen,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

404,Longitudinal Relations between Parental and Peer Support for Violent and Nonviolent Responses to Conflict and Early Adolescent Dating Aggression,"LONGITUDINAL RELATIONS BETWEEN PERCEIVED PARENTAL AND PEER SUPPORT FOR VIOLENT AND NONVIOLENT RESPONSES TO CONFLICT AND EARLY ADOLESCENT DATING AGGRESSION By Rachel C. Garthe, M.S. A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2016 Major Director: Dr. Terri N. Sullivan Associate Professor Developmental Psychology High prevalence and the negative legal, health, and psychological consequences of adolescent dating aggression underscore the need to identify risk and protective processes associated with this type of aggression. Studying dating aggression in early adolescence is important, as this is the developmental time frame when most youth are establishing attitudes, beliefs, and norms for dating behaviors. The current study investigated longitudinal associations between perceived parental and peer support for violent and nonviolent responses to conflict and dating aggression perpetration among middle school students. Participants included 1,399 adolescents (52% female) in the sixth (n = 466), seventh (n = 467), and eighth (n = 466) grades. Results showed that peer support for nonviolent responses predicted lower frequencies of subsequent dating aggression among sixth graders, and perceived parental support for nonviolent responses resulted in decreased frequencies of dating aggression in the seventh and eighth grades. Peer support for violent responses predicted increased dating aggression in the seventh grade, and perceived parental support for violent responses led to higher frequencies of dating aggression in the eighth grade. Additionally, dating aggression predicted changes in adolescent perceptions of parental and peer support for violent and nonviolent responses. No sex differences were found in these models. Lastly, moderation analyses identified two significant interactions. These interactions illustrated that different combinations of parental and peer support for violent and nonviolent responses affected dating aggression perpetration, highlighting the importance of examining mixed messages and combinations of messages from parents and peers. Overall, the findings from the current study indicated that adolescent perceptions of parental and peer support for violent and nonviolent responses to conflict are important risk and protective processes, respectively, that are longitudinally associated with dating aggression. These findings can inform dating violence prevention programs, and stress the importance of adolescent, parental, and peer involvement in these programs.",,2016.0,237,0,0,False,,,,,,404,7538850,Rachel C.

The considerable reach of this medium makes it crucial to assess the messages that audiences are taking away concerning gender in these games. In this content analysis, I investigate the representation of binary gender in the narratives of modern video games from the perspective of cultivation theory. Ten popular games from 2007 through 2013 are selected for this investigation. The characteristics of each game’s main character are evaluated in the context of the narrative to uncover emergent trends, tropes, and themes over the course of gameplay. Men outnumber women in protagonist roles, and women serve as catalysts for the central conflicts throughout the narrative. Gaming narratives also tend to embody the male power fantasy trope, with both male and female protagonists becoming masculinized through the story’s progression.

407,The Meaning of Patient-Nurse Interaction for Older Hospitalized Women: A Phenomenological Study,"The purpose of this dissertation is was to explore how older women perceived their interactions with nurses after receiving care in a hospital setting. Older women are a vulnerable population subject to being overlooked or misunderstood by the nurses caring for them, hence the importance of this study. To gather the data on older women’s lived world of nursing care, I used a phenomenological approach based on a hermeneutic framework that considers linguistic, historical, and social factors to interpret older women’s lived world of nursing care while hospitalized. I personally interviewed seven women between the ages of 66 and 81 after their hospitalizations, and then analyzed the data by means of a theoretical lens derived from critical feminism and adapted to gerontology. I discovered that what the participants found most meaningful was being cared for by nurses who embraced the primacy of caring in such a complete way as to be life giving for them. All seven valued the morally grounded feminine ideal of caring that was exemplified by some of their nurses. They experienced feelings of being in control and of being powerless while interacting with their nurses. When the participants felt in control, their interactions with their nurses were characterized by mutuality, respect, and balanced relational energy. When they felt powerless, their interactions were characterized by lack of voice and agency, and by an imbalanced relational energy. This feeling of powerlessness challenged their sense of personhood. Meaningful, direct interactions with their nurses helped the participants successfully negotiate their terms of care. However, all seven women found that they could not predict when these meaningful interactions would occur. The main implication of this study is the need for further research into 1) ways of increasing nurses’ awareness of what it means to be an older hospitalized woman, and 2) nursing education endeavors that target relational work of nurses with their older generation patients.",,2015.0,77,0,0,False,"The main implication of this study is the need for further research into ways of increasing nurses’ awareness of what it means to be an older hospitalized woman, and nursing education endeavors that target relational work of nurses with their older generation patients.",,"[{'title': 'georgefox.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=edd'}]",D Mize - 2015 - digitalcommons.georgefox.edu,,407,122845036,Deborah Mize,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,

418,Racial microaggressions cohort differences.,"This study examines the relationship between racial microaggressions and psychological distress and anger rumination among younger and older cohorts who belong to a racial or ethnic group other than White or European-American. The purpose of this study was to compare these relationships between older and younger cohorts. The hypotheses were that age will moderate the relationship between racial microaggressions and psychological distress and that age will moderate the relationship between racial microaggressions and anger rumination. A survey method was used to test the two hypotheses. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and were compensated $1 for their participation. The participants were divided into a younger group and older group to test the effect of age on the relationship between racial microaggressions and psychological distress. A test for difference between independent correlations was used to determine if the correlations of the younger and older groups significantly differed from each other, and a t-test was used to measure the relationship between age and experiences of racial microaggressions. The correlations of the younger and older groups did not significantly differ from each other; thus, the results did not confirm either of the hypotheses. Future research should examine how the effect of age on racial microaggressions and psychological distress varies across different racial and ethnic groups. RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS COHORT DIFFERENCES 3 Racial Microaggressions Cohort Differences Racial discrimination is described as the “behavioral component of racism” which is defined as “the beliefs, attitudes, institutional arrangements, and acts that tend to denigrate individuals or groups because of phenotypic characteristics or ethnic group affiliation” (Yetman, 1985; Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999, p. 805). The elimination of Jim Crow laws and progress toward racial equality due to the civil rights movement has affected the manifestation of racial discrimination toward racial and ethnic minority groups. There has been a transformation from more overt types of racial discrimination to more subtle types of racial discrimination as a result of this progress toward racial equality. Overt types of racial discrimination such as racial slurs are not as socially acceptable as they were prior to the civil rights movement; thus, subtle types of racial discrimination such as racial microaggressions have become more commonplace. Racial microaggressions are “brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group” (Sue et al., 2007, p. 273). Racial microaggressions are considered to be a more modern, subtle type of racial discrimination in contrast to the covert racial discrimination that was more prevalent prior to the civil rights movement in the United States. This study examined the relationship between racial microaggressions and psychological distress among older and younger cohorts. I explored the cohort differences between older and younger African Americans and other racial and ethnic minority groups to discover whether age is a moderating factor in the relationship between perceived racial microaggressions and psychological distress along with anger rumination. This study of examining cohort differences RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS COHORT DIFFERENCES 4 has important implications of differentiating the cohort specific effects of psychological distress and anger rumination relevant to clinical and nonclinical treatment of these respective cohorts. Consequences of Discrimination Studies have shown that the prevalence of racial discrimination has an impact on the psychological wellbeing of racial minorities. Racial discrimination has been found to be a predictor of generalized anxiety disorder and nonclinical paranoia for African Americans (Soto, Dawson-Andoh, & BeLue, 2011; Combs, et al., 2006). Among younger racial minority adults, racial discrimination has been significantly associated with attenuated positive psychotic symptoms (Anglin, Lighty, Greenspoon, & Ellman, 2014). Detrimental coping responses to perceived racial discrimination are another consequence of discrimination for African Americans. A study by Gibbons et al. (2007) found that perceived racial discrimination is associated with willingness to use drugs due to anger and hostility. The negative effects associated with perceived racial discrimination can serve as an unhealthy gateway to risky behaviors such as illicit drug use in an attempt to cope with this discrimination. Simons, Chen, Stewart, and Brody (2003) found a link between racial discrimination and delinquency among African American children. Studies have also found an association between perceived discrimination and internal and external expressions of anger among older adults (Lee & Bierman, 2016). Previous literature has shown that racial discrimination has a negative effect on the psychological wellbeing of both younger and older cohorts alike; thus, being a victim of racial discrimination has serious implications for health outcomes. Studies have shown that anger is a common response displayed by victims of racial discrimination (Brondolo et al., 2008; Broudy et al., 2007). Pittman (2011) found that the usage of anger to cope with racial discrimination was associated with decreased well-being and RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS COHORT DIFFERENCES 5 increased psychological distress in a sample of African Americans. Other studies have shown that older adults display less anger than younger adults which could have important implications for the role of age in the relationship between anger and racial discrimination (Mirowsky & Ross, 2003; Schieman, 1999). Rumination is defined as the tendency to “brood about negative experiences and feelings” (Anestis, Anestis, Selby,& Joiner, 2009, p. 292). One study has shown that ruminative thoughts are associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression (Segerstrom et al., 2000). Furthermore, Miranda, Polanco-Roman, Tsypes, and Valderrama (2013) found that rumination mediates the relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among racial minorities. Anger rumination can have negative consequences for the well-being of victims of racial discrimination due to the association between anger rumination and psychological distress. The negative effects of rumination for racial microaggressions could be higher due to the subtle nature of microaggressions that could cause victims to spend more time ruminating about whether the incident was an act of discrimination. Racial Microaggressions and the Changing Form of Discrimination The term racial microaggressions was introduced by Chester Pierce in 1970 to describe “subtle, stunning, often automatic, and non-verbal exchanges which are ‘put downs’” (Sue et al., 2007, p. 272). Racial microaggressions are more difficult to identify as acts of racial discrimination due to the subtleness of the act unlike overt acts of racial discrimination. Sue et al. (2007) identified three forms of microaggressions: microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations. Microassaults are acts that are meant to harm the victim through “namecalling, avoidant behavior, or purposeful discriminatory actions,” while microinsults are acts that degrade someone’s racial identity (2007, p. 274). In contrast to overt racial discrimination such as Jim Crow laws, racial microaggressions can be unknowingly perpetrated by well-meaning RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS COHORT DIFFERENCES 6 friends and family members which can make it more difficult for victims to process and cope with the effects of these microaggressions (Sue et al., 2007). This is exemplified by microinvalidations which are acts that make light of the experiences of racial minorities such as a white person telling a black person that they are colorblind (Sue et al., 2007). The subtle nature and often personal relationship that perpetrators of racial microaggressions have with the victim can be emotionally taxing as victims are faced with the uncertainty of identifying the act as discriminatory. Previous research on racial microaggressions has identified relationships between racial microaggressions and psychological distress and other adverse health effects. Hollingsworth et al. (2016) found that certain types of racial microaggressions are associated with the perception of being a burden to others, which is associated with significant levels of suicidal ideation among African Americans ages 15 to 24. Racial microaggressions have also been linked to symptoms of depression and poorer self-esteem which can also be associated with suicidal ideation (O’Keefe, Wingate, Cole, Hollingworth, & Tucker, 2015; Nadal, Wong, Griffin, Davidoff, & Sriken, 2014). A study conducted by Nadal, Griffin, Wong, Davidoff, and Davis (2017) showed that racial microaggressions are correlated with poorer health conditions and poorer social functioning among participants. The effects of racial microaggressions on racial minorities can include adverse effects in the domains of physical health and mental health. Age Differences of Racial Discrimination Older cohorts, particularly African Americans ages 60 and older, grew up during the Jim Crow era and experienced the transformation of the civil rights movement that eliminated discriminatory laws and practices in favor of implementing values of equality. Younger cohorts have contrastingly grown up in a more racially tolerant society that has resulted in more RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS COHORT DIFFERENCES 7 exposure to racial microaggressions rather than overt forms of racial discrimination that are reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. Schuman and colleagues (1997) found that overt forms of racial discrimination have declined over the past several decades in favo",,2019.0,31,0,0,False,The cohort differences between older and younger African Americans and other racial and ethnic minority groups were explored to discover whether age is a moderating factor in the relationship between perceived racial microaggressions and psychological distress along with anger rumination.,,,,,418,153682936,Shayla Thompson,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,Review

420,Cripping the Memoir: Unraveling the Discourse Around Disabled Athletes' Identities,"This thesis rhetorically examines the discourse surrounding disability and body capabilities. I employ feminist theory, queer theory, disability, theory and performance theory as I analyze the memoirs and media surrounding two disabled elite athletes, Sarah Reinertsen and Mark Zupan. I examine the construction of identity for these athletes and what the language use surrounding these athletes means to the current status of disability discourse. These memoirs have the potential to reach a large lay audience, and therefore, the opportunity to educate and challenge assumptions. My analysis leads me to conclude that the limitations of memoir and societal pressures allow for instances of disability to be challenged only when heteronormative and hegemonic instances of other identities are also upheld.

421,"Culpabilité et conduites prosociales : l'embodiment, l'approbation sociale et l'épuisement du soi","La culpabilite est une emotion introspective resultant de la reflexion sur l'association entre le soi et ses propres torts. Parce que la culpabilite montre les aspects probablement desagreables du soi, les individus sont motives a se deculpabiliser. D'apres les theories traditionnelles de la culpabilite, la culpabilite vient de processus cognitifs de haut niveau et son intensite depend du niveau d'attribution de la faute au soi. Ces theories, fondees sur les theories standards de cognition, soulignent les aspects intellectuels et rationnels de la culpabilite. Les theories de l'embodiment rejettent la separation entre les etats corporels et situationnels et la connaissance. Les stimuli sociaux peuvent produire des etats somatiques et susciter des reponses dans le soi. Les etats corporels et visceraux du soi peuvent susciter des etats affectifs. Selon les theories personnifiees, la culpabilite doit aussi etre influencee par des etats corporels et situationnels. Nos etudes ont vise a comprendre les influences des facteurs corporels et contextuels sur la culpabilite et la deculpabilisation. Une premiere etude (N=65) a compare l'efficacite de l'observation et de la personnification de nettoyage sur la deculpabilisation. Les resultats ont montre que (a) l'observation de nettoyage a pu deculpabiliser les individus et les conduire a se comporter moins prosocialement mais qu'elle etait moins efficace que la personnification de nettoyage ; (b) la personnification du concept de nettoyage a pu apaiser les jugements moraux severes. Deux etudes (N=393) ont ensuite explore l'effet de l'approbation sociale sur la deculpabilisation au moyen de la personnification du concept de la proprete. Les resultats ont montre que l'approbation sociale etait un facteur important dans la personnification du concept de la proprete et qu'elle a pu moderer l'effet du concept de proprete sur la deculpabilisation. Deux etudes (N=141) ont enfin analyse l'effet de l'epuisement et de la restauration d'energie sur la culpabilite et la deculpabilisation. Les resultats ont montre que l'epuisement a diminue le sentiment de culpabilite puis le comportement prosocial, et que la restauration d'energie a pu restaurer la capacite d'eprouver de la culpabilite. Nos travaux montrent que, la culpabilite est une emotion morale et prosociale qui est dependante de facteurs corporels et situationnels.

431,Protocol for development of a reporting guideline (TRIPOD-AI) and risk of bias tool (PROBAST-AI) for diagnostic and prognostic prediction model studies based on artificial intelligence,"Introduction The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) were both published to improve the reporting and critical appraisal of prediction model studies for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.

432,"The ""Companion animal model"": an ethical discussion on using pets with spontaeous cancer in pre-clinical cancer research","Animal experimentation is a fundamental part of pre-clinical research. Among primary goals of animal research is to benefit the health and wellbeing of humankind. Animal experimentation in biomedical scientific research is a contentious topic in research ethics. On one side, animal experimentation is considered to be ethically acceptable because it benefits human interests. Alternatively, many consider reifying and inflicting pain on animals for humanity's gain as violating animal moral rights, and thus it is deemed unethical. There remains no clear-cut universal consensus regarding the ethical legitimacy of animal use in laboratories, and the number of animals used in pre-clinical research has grown in the last two decades. This has resulted in a strong movement urging for reforms to current animal models in biomedical research. However, some types of pre-clinical research cannot replace animal models, and continue to need them for proper scientific results, such as cancer research. Cancer research is extremely strenuous and demanding on animal subjects. Consequently, numerous researchers and animal activists have developed moral malaise regarding experimental animal use in pre-clinical cancer research. Further concerns have emerged regarding transferability and relevancy of data gathered from experimental animal subjects to human clinical trials. Accordingly, a novel in-vivo reform to address these concerns is the Companion Animal Model (CAM), where pets who spontaneously develop cancer are used as pre-clinical cancer research subjects. While the use of pets as subjects is starting to be recognized in the pre-clinical research field, the ethical considerations and complications associated with the CAM have not been explored in depth. This thesis discusses the pragmatic benefits and limitations of the CAM, as well as suggests additional ethical responsibilities that researchers should uphold to respect the owner-companion animal relationship. Further, certain potential ethical complications that may emerge when using the CAM are introduced. The ethical discussion is based on owner-companion animal and researcher-animal relationships, as well as the moral rights, interests, obligations, and responsibilities of the owner, companion animal, and researchers. Finally, this thesis encourages further ethical discussion regarding the CAM prior to any policy or guideline formalization.%%%%Les experiences faites sur les animaux sont fondamentales a la recherche preclinique.

However, recent research within the field of evolutionary psychology has suggested that the generation of particular cultural values have arisen because they indirectly influenced pathogen avoidance. Based upon the parasite model of democratization developed by Thornhill, Fincher and Aran (2009), it was tested whether the reduction of pathogens in decreases authoritarianism and restrictiveness of sexuality, which subsequently decreases support for the censorship of pornography. An analysis of country-level data was undertaken to test whether the historical prevalence of pathogens in a country is related to the legal status of pornography. In addition, an online experiment was administered, in which participants were exposed to either a pathogen prime, a threatening gun prime, or a control. While results did not show a clear link between pathogens and censorship, some interesting results were found.",,2014.0,0,0,0,False,,Book,"[{'title': 'escholarship.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://escholarship.org/content/qt5389m950/qt5389m950.pdf'}]",CS Seaman - 2014 - search.proquest.com,,438,12992099,Christopher Seaman,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

A descriptive content analysis was conducted to determine what is currently taught about bisexuality and bisexual-identified clients in CACREP-accredited counseling programs. Instructors teaching multicultural counseling in CACREP-accredited programs were asked to provide syllabi, as well as information on textbooks and supplemental materials. Combining constructionism with queer theory and elements of post-positivism, I explore the magnitude to which bisexuality is addressed. Qualitative analysis provided insight into the essence of the information provided to counselors-in-training concerning bisexuality and the needs o f bisexual-identified clients. Using the critical lens provided by queer theory and the tripartite model of multicultural counseling competencies, the results of this study suggest that increased attention to training regarding bisexual-identified clients should be included in counselor education curriculum and materials.

448,Identifying change processes in group-based health behaviour-change interventions: development of the mechanisms of action in group-based interventions (MAGI) framework,"ABSTRACT Group-based interventions are widely used to promote health-related behaviour change. While processes operating in groups have been extensively described, it remains unclear how behaviour change is generated in group-based health-related behaviour-change interventions. Understanding how such interventions facilitate change is important to guide intervention design and process evaluations. We employed a mixed-methods approach to identify, map and define change processes operating in group-based behaviour-change interventions. We reviewed multidisciplinary literature on group dynamics, taxonomies of change technique categories, and measures of group processes. Using weight-loss groups as an exemplar, we also reviewed qualitative studies of participants’ experiences and coded transcripts of 38 group sessions from three weight-loss interventions. Finally, we consulted group participants, facilitators and researchers about our developing synthesis of findings. The resulting ‘Mechanisms of Action in Group-based Interventions’ (MAGI) framework comprises six overarching categories: (1) group intervention design features, (2) facilitation techniques, (3) group dynamic and development processes, (4) inter-personal change processes, (5) selective intra-personal change processes operating in groups, and (6) contextual influences.

Ratliff May 11,2012 This dissertation outlines a theoretical model for contextualizing contemporary women's art practice in Mexico within the profound socioeconomic and political events that have taken place since 1968, characterized by the steady breakdown and eventual turnover of the Mexican state. Following the spatial theories outlined by Henry Lefebvre in The Production of Space, this study adopts the logic that social spaces are a direct production of the societies that inhabit them, as well as the social relations, ideologies, and notions of power that are espoused therein. Focusing on the artists Paula Santiago, the collective Polvo de Gallina Negra, Daniela Rossell, Minerva Cuevas, and Teresa MargolIes, I identify within their works the visualization of three critical spaces of intervention: the female body, the familial home, and the streets as a site of protest. Organized according to a framework that emphasizes spatial politics, I argue that such works constitute a feminist production of space that challenges the social relations, hierarchies of power, and gender roles that have been embodied by traditional ""spaces of femininity."" The artists' respective performances, photography, installations, and sculptures are analyzed according to how they confront traditional definitions of femininity and gender norms that limit and confine women's",,2012.0,207,3,0,True,,Book,,JL Ratliff - 2012 - search.proquest.com,,451,100916930,J.

453,Governing Bodies: Caster Semenya and the Rhetorical Management of Sex and Gender Ambiguity in Professional Athletics,"GOVERNING BODIES: CASTER SEMENYA AND THE RHETORICAL MANAGEMENT OF SEX AND GENDER AMBIGUITY IN PROFESSIONAL ATHLETICS Samuel Robert Evans Old Dominion University, 2015 Director: Dr. Lindal Buchanan Sport has long been thought o f as an “opiate for the masses,” where a collective can forget about social, political, racial, or econom ic differences and unify to com pete in the same space or root for a common team (Eitzen and Sage 202). Scholarship in sports com m unication, sports rhetoric, and sports sociology, however, has shown that this view o f sport as an apolitical cultural institution separate from impactful political debate is oversimplified. Rather, sports are key sites in which beliefs about gender, race, class, and politics are made manifest. This dissertation uses the case o f Caster Semenya, a female South African middledistance runner who was wrongly accused o f being a man com peting in a w om en’s race, to shed light on the ways athletics shape definitions o f sex and gender. I suggest that governing bodies in professional athletics have em ployed rhetorical silence in rules to maintain the power to determ ine who can access the gendered space o f an athletics competition and under what pretenses. I assert that despite the fact that com petitive spaces restrict ath letes’ gender deliveries to a great degree, athletes such as Sem enya still retain some autonomy in delivering their gender to viewers, though that delivery does have significant consequences. And finally, I suggest that U.S. m edia coverage o f Sem enya reaffirms a binary gender ideology by rhetorically scapegoating Sem enya, separating her from the collective and sym bolically sacrificing her to reaffirm binary gender ideals. By identifying the methods in which sex and gender am biguity are presented and treated in sports, this dissertation identifies a need for a clearer, non-alienating way o f discussing sex and gender variance in sport and society.

463,Hate Speech Detection through AlBERTo Italian Language Understanding Model,"The task of identifying hate speech in social networks has recently attracted considerable interest in the community of natural language processing. This challenge has great importance for identifying cyberattacks on minors, bullying activities, misogyny, or other kinds of hate discriminations that can cause diseases. Identifying them quickly and accurately can, therefore, help to solve situations that are dangerous for the health of the attacked people. Numerous national and international initiatives have addressed this problem by providing many resources and solutions to the problem. In particular, we focus on the Hate Speech Detection evaluation campaign (HaSpeeDe) held at Evalita 2018. It proposes an evaluation campaign with the aim of developing strategies for identifying hate speeches on Twitter and Facebook written in the Italian language. The dataset released for the task has been used by the classification approach proposed in this work for demonstrating that it is possible to solve the task efficiently and accurately. Our solution is based on an Italian Language Understanding model trained with a BERT architecture and 200M of Italian Tweets (AlBERTo). We used AlBERTo for fine-tuning a classification model of hate speech, obtaining state of the art results considering the best systems presented at the HaSpeeDe workshop. In this regard, AlBERTo is here proposed as one of the most versatile resources to be used for the task of classification of Social Media Textual contents in the Italian Language. The claim is supported by the similar results obtained by AlBERTo in the task of sentiment analysis, and irony detection demonstrated in previous works.

464,"All You Need is ""Love"": Evading Hate Speech Detection","With the spread of social networks and their unfortunate use for hate speech, automatic detection of the latter has become a pressing problem. In this paper, we reproduce seven state-of-the-art hate speech detection models from prior work, and show that they perform well only when tested on the same type of data they were trained on. Based on these results, we argue that for successful hate speech detection, model architecture is less important than the type of data and labeling criteria. We further show that all proposed detection techniques are brittle against adversaries who can (automatically) insert typos, change word boundaries or add innocuous words to the original hate speech. A combination of these methods is also effective against Google Perspective - a cutting-edge solution from industry. Our experiments demonstrate that adversarial training does not completely mitigate the attacks, and using character-level features makes the models systematically more attack-resistant than using word-level features.",AISec@CCS,2018.0,31,157,19,True,"It is argued that for successful hate speech detection, model architecture is less important than the type of data and labeling criteria, and all proposed detection techniques are brittle against adversaries who can (automatically) insert typos, change word boundaries or add innocuous words to the original hate speech.",,,,,464,51248306,Tommi Gröndahl,27083576,Luca Pajola,2464929,Mika Juuti,145746490,M.

466,A Unified Deep Learning Architecture for Abuse Detection,"Hate speech, offensive language, sexism, racism, and other types of abusive behavior have become a common phenomenon in many online social media platforms. In recent years, such diverse abusive behaviors have been manifesting with increased frequency and levels of intensity. Despite social media's efforts to combat online abusive behaviors this problem is still apparent. In fact, up to now, they have entered an arms race with the perpetrators, who constantly change tactics to evade the detection algorithms deployed by these platforms. Such algorithms, not disclosed to the public for obvious reasons, are typically custom-designed and tuned to detect only one specific type of abusive behavior, but usually miss other related behaviors. In the present paper, we study this complex problem by following a more holistic approach, which considers the various aspects of abusive behavior. We focus on Twitter, due to its popularity, and analyze user and textual properties from different angles of abusive posting behavior. We propose a deep learning architecture, which utilizes a wide variety of available metadata, and combines it with automatically-extracted hidden patterns within the text of the tweets, to detect multiple abusive behavioral norms which are highly inter-related. The proposed unified architecture is applied in a seamless and transparent fashion without the need for any change of the architecture but only training a model for each task (i.e., different types of abusive behavior). We test the proposed approach with multiple datasets addressing different abusive behaviors on Twitter. Our results demonstrate high performance across all datasets, with the AUC value to range from 92% to 98%.",Web Science Conference,2018.0,45,149,12,True,"A deep learning architecture is proposed, which utilizes a wide variety of available metadata, and combines it with automatically-extracted hidden patterns within the text of the tweets, to detect multiple abusive behavioral norms which are highly inter-related.",,,,,466,35739523,Antigoni-Maria Founta,2550292,Despoina Chatzakou,1946641,N.

477,Six Things I Hate About You (in Italian) and Six Classification Strategies to More and More Effectively Find Them,"While favouring communications and easing information sharing, Online Social Networks are increasingly used to launch harmful campaigns against specific groups and individuals. Although providers struggle to keep pace by manually removing hate content published on their platforms, recent research efforts rely on automatic text classification techniques, whose performances are usually measured on annotated corpora. In this work, we propose six distinct machine learning classification strategies: three based on conventional machine learning approaches, three based on neural networks. The latter are able to process texts almost from scratch, avoiding the need of i) NLP tools specialised for a specific language, ii) the phase of time-consuming feature engineering, and iii) the high computational cost usually derived from processing a huge amount of features. Thus, the main goal of the paper is to investigate whether it is possible to rely on neural networks and to achieve performance results at least comparable with those of NLP-based classifiers. The performances of the six configurations are evaluated over an annotated dataset consisting of 4,000 Italian tweets and 4,000 Italian Facebook comments. By comparing the classification results, we demonstrate that relying on deep learning techniques for hate speech detection is more than encouraging. In particular, a deep learning model, based on an ensemble approach, obtains a F1 score of 0.786 on the Twitter data and 0.775 on the Facebook ones, the best results, compared to the ones obtained with the other tested configurations.",Italian Conference on Cybersecurity,2019.0,32,2,0,False,Whether it is possible to rely on neural networks and to achieve performance results at least comparable with those of NLP-based classifiers is investigated and it is demonstrated that relying on deep learning techniques for hate speech detection is more than encouraging.,,,,,477,2811629,T.

480,Neural Word Decomposition Models for Abusive Language Detection,"The text we see in social media suffers from lots of undesired characterstics like hatespeech, abusive language, insults etc. The nature of this text is also very different compared to the traditional text we see in news with lots of obfuscated words, intended typos. This poses several robustness challenges to many natural language processing (NLP) techniques developed for traditional text. Many techniques proposed in the recent times such as charecter encoding models, subword models, byte pair encoding to extract subwords can aid in dealing with few of these nuances. In our work, we analyze the effectiveness of each of the above techniques, compare and contrast various word decomposition techniques when used in combination with others.

482,Identify Abusive and Offensive Language in Indonesian Twitter using Deep Learning Approach,"Indonesia has a huge number of Twitter users and a lot of them often communicate using abusive language. Not only in the context of jokes, many Indonesian netizens often use abusive language to curse (offense) someone. Research about abusive language detection in Indonesian Twitter has been done using classical machine learning approach. However, the performance was still not too good, especially in differentiating whether the tweet is an abusive but not offensive or an offensive language. This paper implements a deep learning approach to enhance the performance when identifying abusive but not offensive or an offensive language.

489,Queens Are Powerful Too: Mitigating Gender Bias in Dialogue Generation,"Models often easily learn biases present in the training data, and their predictions directly reflect this bias. We analyze gender bias in dialogue data, and examine how this bias is actually amplified in subsequent generative chit-chat dialogue models. We measure gender bias in six existing dialogue datasets, and focus on the most biased one, the multi-player text-based fantasy adventure dataset LIGHT, as a testbed for our bias mitigation techniques. The LIGHT dataset is highly imbalanced with respect to gender, containing predominantly male characters, likely because it is entirely collected by crowdworkers and reflects common biases that exist in fantasy or medieval settings. We consider three techniques to mitigate gender bias: counterfactual data augmentation, targeted data collection, and bias controlled training. We show that our proposed techniques mitigate gender bias in LIGHT by balancing the genderedness of generated dialogue utterances and are particularly effective in combination. We quantify performance using various evaluation methods---such as quantity of gendered words, a dialogue safety classifier, and human studies---all of which show that our models generate less gendered, but equally engaging chit-chat responses.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2019.0,86,124,12,True,"This work measures gender bias in dialogue data, and examines how this bias is actually amplified in subsequent generative chit-chat dialogue models, and considers three techniques to mitigate gender bias: counterfactual data augmentation, targeted data collection, and bias controlled training.",,,,,489,31461304,Emily Dinan,144270981,Angela Fan,81840293,Adina Williams,39219656,Jack Urbanek,1743722,Douwe Kiela,145183709,J.

490,Detecting Toxic Content Online and the Effect of Training Data on Classification Performance,"The spread of toxic content online has attracted a wealth of research into methods of automatic detection and classification in recent years. However, two limitations still exist: 1) the lack of support for multi-label classification; and 2) the lack of understanding of the impact of the typical unbalanced datasets on such tasks. In this work, we build three state of the art methods for the task of multi-label classification of toxic content online, and compare the effect of training data size on their performance. The three methods of choice are based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), respectively. We conduct learning curve analysis and show that CNN is the most robust method as it outperforms the other two regardless of the sizes of the dataset, even on very small amounts of data. This challenges the conventional belief that Neural Networks require significant amounts of data to train accurate models. We also empirically derive indicative thresholds of training data size to help determine a reliable estimate of classifier performance, or maximise potential classifier performance in such tasks.",EasyChair Preprints,2019.0,32,1,0,True,"This work builds three state of the art methods for the task of multi-label classification of toxic content online, and compares the effect of training data size on their performance, and shows that CNN is the most robust method as it outperforms the other two regardless of the sizes of the dataset, even on very small amounts of data.",,,,,490,2146630592,Zhixue Zhao,2046811422,Ziqi Zhang,1759761,F.

These uncivil interactions can have a powerful negative impact on people by marginalizing minorities and disadvantaged groups. The linguistic subtlety of microaggressions in communication has made it difficult for researchers to analyze their exact nature, and to quantify and extract microaggressions automatically. Specifically, the lack of a corpus of real-world microaggressions and objective criteria for annotating them have prevented researchers from addressing these problems at scale. In this paper, we devise a general but nuanced, computationally operationalizable typology of microaggressions based on a small subset of data that we have. We then create two datasets: one with examples of diverse types of microaggressions recollected by their targets, and another with gender-based microaggressions in public conversations on social media.

However, because such systems are typically black boxes, user trust in and acceptance of the system is not easily achieved, as black box systems can be perceived as nontransparent and moderating user comments is easily associated with censorship. Therefore, we investigate the relationship of system transparency through explanations, user trust and system acceptance with an online experiment.

497,Sex Robots—A Harbinger for Emerging AI Risk,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more commonplace in all aspects of the developed world, where robots might help with tasks as diverse as hospital operations to defusing explosives (Weng et al., 2009; Linkov et al., 2018; Murphy, 2019). Historically, the sex industry has been on the forefront of implementation of innovative technologies, and integrating AI is unlikely to be an exception. Some AI applications already seek to mimic human dynamics (Weng et al., 2009), such as the conversational Alexa or Siri, which use machine-learning technology to better predict, understand, and correctly fulfill our informational requests. However, the sex industry is innovating AI to fulfill human emotional and physical demands. Though manufacturers of Alexa decided to program the software to refrain from engaging with questions of a sexually explicit or harassing nature (Crum, 2018), digital assistant developers have reported that at least 5% of user interactions were unambiguously sexually explicit (Samuel, 2019). AI embedded in sex dolls can be specifically geared to meet this demand. Current sex robot capabilities include touch and movement detection, blinking, brow movements, head turning and tilting, and holding conversations (Realbotix, 2014; Mlot, 2018) These conversations include simple processes like remembering facts, and more complex ones like engaging with their partners’ emotions (Shen, 2019). Sex robots are complex systems where integration of AI and traditional (e.g., chemicals) and novel technologies (e.g., advanced materials) may result in widely unknown and unpredictable risks. Researchers have already noted the lack of data about public health aspects of sex robot use (Cox-George and Bewley, 2018), and concerns include addiction, social isolation, non-consensual replication of real people, and enabling misogyny, racism, and pedophilia, though supporters have also claimed that sex robots could provide safe outlets for harmful urges (see Morin, 2016; Readhead, 2016; Richardson, 2016; Maras and Shapiro, 2017; Sharkey et al., 2017; Campaign Against Sex Robots, 2018). However, risks from sex robots may also arise from the technology developed for them. Herein, we consider the pathway for risks to emerge from AI advancement within sex robots and argue that an aversion to regulating pleasure devices, combined with an aptitude for sex to spur technological innovation may produce unique risks (Levy, 2009; West, 2018). AI development in sex robots requires immediate policy attention.",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,2019.0,47,7,0,True,"A pathway for risks to emerge from AI advancement within sex robots is considered and an aversion to regulating pleasure devices, combined with an aptitude for sex to spur technological innovation may produce unique risks.",,,,,497,6534713,S.

498,Enriching Abusive Language Detection with Community Context,"Uses of pejorative expressions can be benign or actively empowering. When models for abuse detection misclassify these expressions as derogatory, they inadvertently censor productive conversations held by marginalized groups. One way to engage with non-dominant perspectives is to add context around conversations. Previous research has leveraged user- and thread-level features, but it often neglects the spaces within which productive conversations take place. Our paper highlights how community context can improve classification outcomes in abusive language detection. We make two main contributions to this end.

499,Enriching Abusive Language Detection with Community Context,"Uses of pejorative expressions can be benign or actively empowering. When models for abuse detection misclassify these expressions as derogatory, they inadvertently censor productive conversations held by marginalized groups. One way to engage with non-dominant perspectives is to add context around conversations. Previous research has leveraged user- and thread-level features, but it often neglects the spaces within which productive conversations take place. Our paper highlights how community context can improve classification outcomes in abusive language detection. We make two main contributions to this end. First, we demonstrate that online communities cluster by the nature of their support towards victims of abuse.

500,"Women, politics and Twitter: Using machine learning to change the discourse","Including diverse voices in political decision-making strengthens our democratic institutions. Within the Canadian political system, there is gender inequality across all levels of elected government. Online abuse, such as hateful tweets, leveled at women engaged in politics contributes to this inequity, particularly tweets focusing on their gender. In this paper, we present ParityBOT: a Twitter bot which counters abusive tweets aimed at women in politics by sending supportive tweets about influential female leaders and facts about women in public life. ParityBOT is the first artificial intelligence-based intervention aimed at affecting online discourse for women in politics for the better. The goal of this project is to: $1$) raise awareness of issues relating to gender inequity in politics, and $2$) positively influence public discourse in politics. The main contribution of this paper is a scalable model to classify and respond to hateful tweets with quantitative and qualitative assessments. The ParityBOT abusive classification system was validated on public online harassment datasets. We conclude with analysis of the impact of ParityBOT, drawing from data gathered during interventions in both the $2019$ Alberta provincial and $2019$ Canadian federal elections.",ArXiv,2019.0,20,4,0,False,"ParityBOT is the first artificial intelligence-based intervention aimed at affecting online discourse for women in politics for the better, and a scalable model to classify and respond to hateful tweets with quantitative and qualitative assessments is presented.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11025'}]","L Cuthbertson, A Kearney, R Dawson… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2019 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'A Kearney', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yG6IiZ8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=yG6IiZ8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'yG6IiZ8AAAAJ'}]",500,52228877,Lana Cuthbertson,121823762,Alex Kearney,103737902,R.

501,Social Bias Frames: Reasoning about Social and Power Implications of Language,"Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people’s judgments about others. For example, given a statement that “we shouldn’t lower our standards to hire more women,” most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker - that “women (candidates) are less qualified.” Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80% F1), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2019.0,88,212,40,True,"It is found that while state-of-the-art neural models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias, they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames.",,,,,501,2729164,Maarten Sap,119902504,Saadia Gabriel,3444092,Lianhui Qin,1746807,Dan Jurafsky,144365876,Noah A.

508,Oxford Handbook on AI Ethics Book Chapter on Race and Gender,"From massive face-recognition-based surveillance and machine-learning-based decision systems predicting crime recidivism rates, to the move towards automated health diagnostic systems, artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in scenarios that have serious consequences in people's lives. However, this rapid permeation of AI into society has not been accompanied by a thorough investigation of the sociopolitical issues that cause certain groups of people to be harmed rather than advantaged by it. For instance, recent studies have shown that commercial face recognition systems have much higher error rates for dark skinned women while having minimal errors on light skinned men. A 2016 ProPublica investigation uncovered that machine learning based tools that assess crime recidivism rates in the US are biased against African Americans. Other studies show that natural language processing tools trained on newspapers exhibit societal biases (e.g. finishing the analogy ""Man is to computer programmer as woman is to X"" by homemaker). At the same time, books such as Weapons of Math Destruction and Automated Inequality detail how people in lower socioeconomic classes in the US are subjected to more automated decision making tools than those who are in the upper class. Thus, these tools are most often used on people towards whom they exhibit the most bias. While many technical solutions have been proposed to alleviate bias in machine learning systems, we have to take a holistic and multifaceted approach. This includes standardization bodies determining what types of systems can be used in which scenarios, making sure that automated decision tools are created by people from diverse backgrounds, and understanding the historical and political factors that disadvantage certain groups who are subjected to these tools.",ArXiv,2019.0,14,20,0,False,"A holistic and multifaceted approach is needed to alleviate bias in machine learning systems, including standardization bodies determining what types of systems can be used in which scenarios, making sure that automated decision tools are created by people from diverse backgrounds, and understanding the historical and political factors that disadvantage certain groups who are subjected to these tools.",,,,,508,2076288,Timnit Gebru,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle
509,A Quantitative Approach to Understanding Online Antisemitism,"A new wave of growing antisemitism, driven by fringe Web communities, is an increasingly worrying presence in the socio-political realm. The ubiquitous and global nature of the Web has provided tools used by these groups to spread their ideology to the rest of the Internet. Although the study of antisemitism and hate is not new, the scale and rate of change of online data has impacted the efficacy of traditional approaches to measure and understand these troubling trends.In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study of online antisemitism. We collect hundreds of million posts and images from alt-right Web communities like 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) and Gab. Using scientifically grounded methods, we quantify the escalation and spread of antisemitic memes and rhetoric across the Web. We find the frequency of antisemitic content greatly increases (in some cases more than doubling) after major political events such as the 2016 US Presidential Election and the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. We extract semantic embeddings from our corpus of posts and demonstrate how automated techniques can discover and categorize the use of antisemitic terminology. We additionally examine the prevalence and spread of the antisemitic “Happy Merchant” meme, and in particular how these fringe communities influence its propagation to more mainstream communities like Twitter and Reddit. Taken together, our results provide a data-driven, quantitative framework for understanding online antisemitism. Our methods serve as a framework to augment current qualitative efforts by anti-hate groups, providing new insights into the growth and spread of hate online.",International Conference on Web and Social Media,2018.0,123,95,10,True,"A large-scale, quantitative study of online antisemitism, collecting hundreds of million posts and images from alt-right Web communities like 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) and Gab to quantify the escalation and spread of antisemitic memes and rhetoric across the Web.",,,,,509,10003642,Joel Finkelstein,3447293,Savvas Zannettou,6371940,B.

The family of machine learning methods is not somehow inherently bad or dangerous, nor does implementing them signal any intent to cause harm. Nevertheless, the machine learning assemblage produces a targeting gaze whose algorithms obfuscate the legality of its judgments, and whose iterations threaten to create both specific injustices and broader states of exception.

511,Nothing new here: Emphasizing the social and cultural context of deepfakes,"In the last year and a half, deepfakes have garnered a lot of attention as the newest form of digital manipulation. While not problematic in and of itself, deepfake technology exists in a social environment rife with cybermisogyny, toxic-technocultures, and attitudes that devalue, objectify, and use women’s bodies against them. The basic technology, which in fact embodies none of these characteristics, is deployed within this harmful environment to produce problematic outcomes, such as the creation of fake and non-consensual pornography. The sophisticated technology and metaphysical nature of deepfakes as both real and not real (the body of one person, the face of another) makes them impervious to many technical, legal, and regulatory solutions. For these same reasons, defining the harm deepfakes causes to those targeted is similarly difficult and very often targets of deepfakes are not afforded the protection they require.

512,Task-specific Word Identification from Short Texts Using a Convolutional Neural Network,"Task-specific word identification aims to choose the task-related words that best describe a short text. Existing approaches require well-defined seed words or lexical dictionaries (e.g., WordNet), which are often unavailable for many applications such as social discrimination detection and fake review detection. However, we often have a set of labeled short texts where each short text has a task-related class label, e.g., discriminatory or non-discriminatory, specified by users or learned by classification algorithms. In this paper, we focus on identifying task-specific words and phrases from short texts by exploiting their class labels rather than using seed words or lexical dictionaries. We consider the task-specific word and phrase identification as feature learning. We train a convolutional neural network over a set of labeled texts and use score vectors to localize the task-specific words and phrases. Experimental results on sentiment word identification show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods. We further conduct two case studies to show the effectiveness of our approach. One case study on a crawled tweets dataset demonstrates that our approach can successfully capture the discrimination-related words/phrases.

513,Can AI Solve the Diversity Problem in the Tech Industry? Mitigating Noise and Bias in Employment Decision-Making,"After the first diversity report was issued in 2014 revealing the dearth of women in the tech industry, companies rushed to hire consultants to provide unconscious bias training to their employees. Unfortunately, recent diversity reports show no significant improvement, and, in fact, women lost ground during some of the years. According to a Human Capital Institute survey, nearly 80% of leaders were still using gut feeling and personal opinion to make decisions that affected talent-management practices. By incorporating AI into employment decisions, we can mitigate unconscious bias and variability (noise) in human decision-making. While some scholars have warned that using artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making creates discriminatory results, they downplay the reason for such occurrences - humans. The main concerns noted relate to the risk of reproducing bias in an algorithmic outcome (“garbage in, garbage out”) and the inability to detect bias due to the lack of understanding of the reason for the algorithmic outcome (“black box” problem). In this paper, I argue that responsible AI will abate the problems caused by unconscious biases and noise in human decision-making, and in doing so increase the hiring, promotion, and retention of women in the tech industry. The new solutions to the garbage in, garbage out and black box concerns will be explored. The question is not whether AI should be incorporated into decisions impacting employment, but rather why in 2019 are we still relying on faulty human decision-making.",,2019.0,44,21,1,False,,,,,,513,37964105,Kimberly A.

It draws on a previous study on the relationship between gender and AI,
 complemented by an analysis of digital assistants such as Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant and Siri that reveals how these entities tend to be feminized through their anthropomorphization, the tasks that they perform and their behavioural traits. Furthering this discussion, this article addresses
 current trends of development of digital assistants and their stance towards gender, considering the functions or features that are being prioritized in AI evolution. It then focuses on the main questions raised by researchers and academics when examining the phenomenon and confronts these
 views with discussions around the feminization of AI in the context of online media coverage. This debate also highlights how common conceptions of AI and its portrayals of gender are influenced by bodies of fiction. Finally, the project Conversations with ELIZA seeks to comment on
 this phenomenon by ironically exposing and reinforcing common stereotypes and gender assumptions.

516,Fake News Detection using Deep Learning and Machine Learning Methods - A comparative study on short and long texts,"A great amount of research has been devoted to identifying and categorizing news based on their credibility as either fake or true. However, the complexity of a news content , usually trying to deceive the reader, based on linguistic features or features that contain a volume of sentiment has made it necessary to take the phenomenon of Fake News a step forward and assess the credibility of news not only as fake or true but also as belonging to other categories , thus making the problem a multiclass one. Binary or multi-class Fake News is a complex problem that is difficult to solve and various researchers and Universities around the world have devoted themselves to solving it as it affects numerous aspects of the society by degrading the quality of its citizens’ lives. In this thesis we are examining two Datasets, one containing short text statements and the other containing long text articles, which provide a multi-class architecture in order to assess, compare and prove that long text content is better suited for detecting Fake News than the short text one.

519,From Big Data to Deep Learning: A Leap Towards Strong AI or 'Intelligentia Obscura'?,"Astonishing progress is being made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly in machine learning (ML). Novel approaches of deep learning are promising to even boost the idea of AI equipped with capabilities of self-improvement. But what are the wider societal implications of this development and to what extent are classical AI concepts still relevant? This paper discusses these issues including an overview on basic concepts and notions of AI in relation to big data. Particular focus lies on the roles, societal consequences and risks of machine and deep learning. The paper argues that the growing relevance of AI in society bears serious risks of deep automation bias reinforced by insufficient machine learning quality, lacking algorithmic accountability and mutual risks of misinterpretation up to incrementally aggravating conflicts in decision-making between humans and machines. To reduce these risks and avoid the emergence of an intelligentia obscura requires overcoming ideological myths of AI and revitalising a culture of responsible, ethical technology development and usage. This includes the need for a broader discussion about the risks of increasing automation and useful governance approaches to stimulate AI development with respect to individual and societal well-being.",Big Data and Cognitive Computing,2018.0,70,24,0,True,"It is argued that the growing relevance of AI in society bears serious risks of deep automation bias reinforced by insufficient machine learning quality, lacking algorithmic accountability and mutual risks of misinterpretation up to incrementally aggravating conflicts in decision-making between humans and machines.",,,,,519,37826872,Stefan Strauß,,,,,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Sociology","JournalArticle, Review"
520,Encountering #Feminism on Twitter: Reflections on a Research Collaboration between Social Scientists and Computer Scientists,"The growth of social media presents an unparalleled opportunity for the study of social change. However, the speed and scale of this growth presents challenges for social scientists, particularly those whose methodologies tend to rely on the qualitative analysis of data that are gathered firsthand. Alongside the growth of social media, companies have emerged which have developed tools for interrogating ‘big data’, although often unconnected from social scientists. It is self-evident that collaboration between social scientists and social media analysis companies offers the potential for developing methods for analysing social change on large scales, bringing together their respective expertise in technological innovations and knowledge of social science. What is less well known is how such a partnership might work in practice. This article presents an example of such a collaboration, highlighting the opportunities and challenges that arose in the context of an exploration of feminism on Twitter. As will be shown, machine-learning technologies allow the analysis of data on a scale that would be impossible for human analysts, yet such approaches also heighten challenges regarding the study of social change and communication.",Sociological research online,2018.0,22,3,0,True,,,,,,520,40355221,Steve Kirkwood,5752156,V.

Second, it challenges the assumption that academic research should be seen as separate from the many controversies that surround online hate speech debates globally.

523,Data witnessing: attending to injustice with data in Amnesty International’s Decoders project,"ABSTRACT The concept of witnessing has been used to explore the construction of evidence and experience in settings of law, religion, atrocity, media, history and science. Recent research has examined how digital technologies may multiply the involvement of remote, non-present and unanticipated actors in the witnessing of events. This paper examines what digital data practices at Amnesty International’s Decoders initiative can add to the understanding of witnessing. It introduces the notion of ‘data witnessing’ with reference to four projects on (i) witnessing historical abuses with structured data from digitised documents; (ii) witnessing the destruction of villages with satellite imagery and machine learning; (iii) witnessing environmental injustice with company reports and photographs; and (iv) witnessing online abuse through the classification of Twitter data. These projects illustrate the configuration of experimental apparatuses for witnessing injustices with data. In contrast to accounts which emphasise the presence of an individual human witness at the scene, Amnesty’s data practices are conspicuously collective and distributed, rendering the systemic scale of injustices at a distance, across space and time. Such practices may contribute to research on both (new) media witnessing and data politics, suggesting ways in which care, concern and solidarity may be constructed, structured, extended and delimited by means of digital data.","Information, Communication & Society",2019.0,103,12,0,True,,,,,,523,48417693,J.

528,Ecological Construction of Blended Teaching Model,"Although the concept of ecological class has been universal, practice of ecological class in reality is not satisfying. The paper attempts to analyze class ecology that is based on blended teaching model of face-to-face teaching and e-learning. The paper hopes that it can appeal to every educator's thought and attention by building class ecology of blended teaching model. 1. Raise of the question The ecological theory has been introduced to educational field and concepts such as ecological education, green class, ecological care and ecological class have come to our sight gradually, which means that traditional class has been viewed from the aspect of ecological education. In addition, with rapid development of technology and network techniques, artificial intelligence has been widely used in different fields, which also affects present education and teaching. The development of online education and distance education has been accepted. On January 20, 2018, ""With the coming of artificial intelligence, is education still warm?"" was released on column Focus of China Comment. ""Network resources have been the common knowledge source for teachers and students"", the awkwardness of education was reported in the article. Online teaching platforms such as Zhihuishu and Erya have been introduced by many universities and free MOOCs of more than four hundred subjects have been provided by Ministry of Education recently. We have to think about it and review traditional classroom teaching again. The blended teaching model in MOOCs has been accepted gradually. And it plays an intrinsic role with advantages on online and offline integration. The article is to discuss the construction of blended teaching model on the basis of ecological theory. 2. Ecological deficiency of classroom teaching The construction of effective blended classroom is based on ecological theory. And ecological deficiency of classroom teaching still exists in specific classroom teaching. 2.1 Ecological deficiency of classroom teaching objective Teaching objective is the result that the educator hopes the educatee to achieve. It embodies spirit of the age and represents the view of life and value of the educatee. However, ecological deficiency of some teaching objectives still exists in present classroom teaching, which makes teaching objectives not meet study requirements of the educatee. It is embodied in the following aspects. First, the knowledge-based examination system dominates value orientation of present classroom teaching. With knowledge objective stressed and emotion and motor skill objectives neglected in the objectives of classroom teaching, many students are of high scores and low abilities. On the other hand, because of the traditions formed in teaching in a long term, the development of teachers has been constricted in the stage of Concerning Situation and the teaching objective has been targeted to establish many containers imparting knowledge. In this case, the demand for self-development of students has been neglected and students become volume-produced products. 2.2 Ecological deficiency of classroom teaching subject Under the leadership of wrong objectives of classroom teaching, ecological deficiency also exists 2018 2nd International Conference on Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities (SSAH 2018) Copyright © (2018) Francis Academic Press, UK 139 among teachers and students, respectively the educator and the educatee. In recent years, teaching reforms have been promoted by curriculum reform of basic education and the student-centered concept has been rooted among the people. But teacher-centered concept has been followed in present classroom teaching. Teachers, the educator, dominate activity process, content arrangement and ultimate teaching evaluation of classroom teaching. Students, the educatee, can only accept vapid and boring knowledge passively as the audience. As for this kind of classroom teaching, the subject position of students is not embodied and required ecological balance is broken, which seriously affect the ecological development of classroom teaching. 2.3 Ecological deficiency of classroom teaching environment It was found by ecologist Allee (Warder Clyde Allee, 1885-1955) that cluster could improve the survival ability of animal and he proposed Allee Law in ecology, explaining that over sparse or overstocked population was disadvantageous. With the law used in classroom environment, it is required to arrange class size scientifically to make students study and grow in healthy and harmonious ecological environment. According to the national conditions, it is proposed to arrange 40~50 students in a classroom in China. However, most classrooms contain 70~80 students and some classrooms even contain more than 90 students. The overstocked classroom environment seriously affects normal healthy mental and physical development of students. What's more, the ecological niche of seat arrangement will not be considered. 2.4 Ecological deficiency of classroom teaching evaluation Because of the exam-oriented education for a long time, many exam-oriented concepts have been deeply rooted in the mind of many educators, which confines most teachers in the stage of Concerning Situation. These teachers pay more attention to utilize the 45 minutes of the class and improve scores of students. They do not concern the development of students. As for specific classroom teaching evaluation, the evaluation method, evaluation subject and evaluation content are all respectively single with teaching evaluation of utilitarianism. It is manifested that the participation of students in teaching evaluation is fairly insufficient. In most cases, students can only accept the evaluation of teachers, subject of the teaching evaluation. Therefore, knowledge determinism and study determinism are further reinforced. With biased classroom teaching evaluation mechanism, ecological deficiency of classroom teaching evaluation is serious. 3. Ecological features of blended teaching model Blended teaching model mainly refers to organic integration of face-to-face classroom study and online study at present. Blended teaching model has been developed on the basis of blended study. And it is a new model highlighting online study and ensuring face-to-face study. With perfect integration of class and extracurricular study, online and offline study, the student-centered concept has been highlighted. According to the theory of educational ecology based on ecological balance and ecological system, classroom ecology, as an ecological system, has been formed under interrelation and interaction of four factors of teacher, student, environment and teaching information. The ecological features of blended teaching are mainly embodied in the following. 3.1 Teaching objective of Concerning Students According to the research of Fuller and Brown, the professional development of teachers consists of several stages of concerning survival, concerning situation and concerning student. These stages also reflect development of the educator in teaching concept and teaching objective. The teaching objective of blended teaching mostly concerns development of students. With the change from knowledge orientation to ability orientation, it is expected that education can promote growth and overall development of students and enable them to apply knowledge and ability in life. In blended teaching model, teachers can fully respect students and treat all students equally. They also encourage students to doubt knowledge and have discussion. With their ability in investigation, independent innovation and problem solving motivated, the development of students has been really promoted.",,2018.0,6,0,0,True,,,,,,528,2048188373,Jinlu Li,1786680,Yidong Sun,,,,,,,,,Engineering,Review

531,"Artificial Intelligence for Sustainability. On theoretical limitations, practical potentials and political discourses","Several governments recently adopted strategies to facilitate the development of artificial intelligence (AI), one of the reasons being the pursuit of sustainability – a claim with little scientific grounding so far. In this thesis, I strived to outline the scope of AI’s potentials by showing i) the limits of its theoretical and practical usefulness and ii) the political barriers to using it for sustainability. Through the method of immanent critique, I demonstrated that AI shares most of its theoretical limitations with statistical methods in general and concluded that it is best suited for the narrowly defined area of closed, formal systems with low decision stakes. To assess AI’s practical potentials, I conducted a systematic literature review searching for AI use cases that contribute to the indicators of the German sustainability strategy. The resulting use cases mostly described how AI increased efficiencies or generated empirical knowledge, yet they only marginally addressed the major obstacles to sustainability identified by the government. Since technological possibilities do not linearly translate to real-world adoption, I turned to the realm of politics to unveil dominant discourses that may shape the goals and areas of AI’s use in society. As an exemplary space of AI’s discursive mediation, I examined the German government’s national AI strategy using critical discourse analysis. It resulted that the government prioritized discourses of competitiveness and technological determinism over sustainability considerations. Tensions between different interest groups were linguistically concealed, while competition and technological progress were invoked as external threats to be faced in consensus. This strategy of depoliticization legitimizes and naturalizes current power relations to the advantage of certain actors. The revealed primacy of market logics further reduced the likeliness of realizing AI’s limited sustainability potentials. Yet, alternative ways to govern AI exist and allow overcoming the constructed necessity of neoliberal politics.

533,Speculative Diagrams: Experiments in Mapping YouTube,"The notion that the future has a ‘shape’ is a deep-rooted construct, the cornerstone of how chance is mediated, for example through the ‘distributions’ of probability theory. Algorithmic prediction, via machine learning, builds on these shapes and amplifies their complexity and authority. While the problematic effects of this predictive regime and the preemptive politics it supports are objects of concern for scholars and practitioners across the humanities, social sciences, art, and philosophy, design is surprisingly disengaged from this conversation. Instead, it is either concerned with data visualization, often without questioning its positivist ontology, or with ‘seamless’ non-interfaces which effectively seek to remove choice. Against this backdrop, our proposal brings together design theory and design practice to interrogate current modes of algorithmic prediction and the construction of subjectivity enabled by ‘choice design’. Our designed artifacts are diagrams to think through practice about the shape(s) of the possible. Rather than designing predictable futures, we aim to use diagram-making to expose and reframe choice design.

539,"Not Quite Human: Artificial Intelligence, Animals, and the Regulation of Sentient Property","The advent of artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize nearly every aspect of civil society. AIs will perform complex tasks, occupy jobs traditionally performed by humans, develop groundbreaking inventions, provide familial comfort, and even offer sexual companionship. In part because the versatility of AI makes it suited to perform so many disparate roles, policymakers will need to confront the question of legal status: what are AI in the eyes of the law? Are they mere property? Are they “people” too? Are they something in between? 
This Article takes a first step in answering that question by analogizing AI to another form of sentient property: nonhuman animals. Four centuries of domestic animal rights law offer critical insights into the legal values that AI regulations ought to protect. These include protection of AIs as property (including allocation of responsibility for damage done by AIs); protecting human emotional attachments to companion and romantic AIs; limiting extreme antisocial behavior involving AIs—such as the realistic torture of physically embodied AIs—because of the psychologically harmful consequences it has for humans; and potentially protecting the AIs as intrinsically valuable. These values can be protected by a number of regulatory regimes that have analogously emerged in reaction to animal rights concerns, including anticruelty legislation, private ordering for leased AIs, federal administrative oversight, public nuisance litigation, and research or grant conditions. The practical lessons of animal rights law avoid unhelpfully abstract theorizing and offer a realistic model for regulation of artificial intelligence in the twenty-first century.",,2018.0,0,4,0,False,,,,,,539,116798169,Christian F.

541,"Relationship between Exotic Plant Species Richness, Native Vegetation and Climate in Forest Ecosystems of Chile","In this chapter, we evaluated how native species cover, native species richness, and foliage periodicity of forests are related to exotic species richness in different forest ecosystems distributed through the Mediterranean-type and temperate climate regions of Chile. We compiled published and unpublished data on Chilean vegetation (mainly phytosociological studies) located between 30º and 41º S in which plant species composition and abundance (percentage of cover) per plot was evaluated and published. When all forests were analysed together, we found that exotic species richness was not significantly related to native species richness; it was negatively related to native species cover in both Mediterranean and temperate climatic regions and was greater in deciduous than evergreen forests, although only in the temperate region. In an analysis considering separately every forest type, we observed that only in 50% of these communities, exotic species richness was negatively related to native species cover. Furthermore, in 25% of forest types, exotic species richness was negatively related to native species richness, and in only one forest type, this relationship was positive. Our results suggest that native species produce some resistance against invasion of exotic plants, but this effect may depend on climate and forest type.",Diversity and Ecology of Invasive Plants,2018.0,51,0,0,True,,,,,,541,10206671,P.

546,A Simple Language Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue,"Task-oriented dialogue is often decomposed into three tasks: understanding user input, deciding actions, and generating a response. While such decomposition might suggest a dedicated model for each sub-task, we find a simple, unified approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on the MultiWOZ dataset. SimpleTOD is a simple approach to task-oriented dialogue that uses a single causal language model trained on all sub-tasks recast as a single sequence prediction problem. This allows SimpleTOD to fully leverage transfer learning from pre-trained, open domain, causal language models such as GPT-2. SimpleTOD improves over the prior state-of-the-art by 0.49 points in joint goal accuracy for dialogue state tracking. More impressively, SimpleTOD also improves the main metrics used to evaluate action decisions and response generation in an end-to-end setting for task-oriented dialog systems: inform rate by 8.1 points, success rate by 9.7 points, and combined score by 7.2 points.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2020.0,69,288,75,False,"SimpleTOD is a simple approach to task-oriented dialogue that uses a single causal language model trained on all sub-tasks recast as a single sequence prediction problem, which allows it to fully leverage transfer learning from pre-trained, open domain, causal language models such as GPT-2.",,,,,546,1401953786,Ehsan Hosseini-Asl,143775536,Bryan McCann,30340989,Chien-Sheng Wu,3014143,Semih Yavuz,2166511,R.

547,Sources of Stress Among Midwest American Indian Adults with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Despite alarming health disparities among American Indians (AIs) and acknowledgement that stressors negatively influence health, conceptualization of the full spectrum of stressors that impact Indigenous communities is underdeveloped. To address this gap, we analyze focus group transcripts of AI adults with type 2 diabetes from five tribal communities and classify stressors using an inductive/deductive analytical approach. A Continuum of American Indian Stressor Model was constructed from categorization of nineteen stressor categories within four domains. We further identified poverty, genocide, and colonization as fundamental causes of contemporary stress and health outcomes for AIs and conclude that stressors are generally experienced as chronic, regardless of the duration of the stressor.

548,“It’s a terrible way to go to work:” what 70 million readers’ comments on the Guardian revealed about hostility to women and minorities online,"Abstract In 2006, the Guardian opened many of its articles to readers’ comments to encourage a “conversation” between journalists and their readers. Readers responded enthusiastically, and by 2016 they had posted 70 million comments on the site. However, from the outset many journalists complained about the quality and tone of comments. Female and BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) journalists in particular complained that they were subject to more abuse than their male, white counterparts. This study finds prima facie evidence to support the journalists’ claims. Using comments that had been blocked by moderators as a proxy for abuse and dismissive trolling, it was found that articles written by women did attract a higher percentage of blocked comments than those written by men, regardless of the subject of the article; this effect was heightened when the articles ran in a particularly male-dominated section of the site. There was also evidence that articles written by BAME writers attracted disproportionate levels of blocked comments, even though the research was not designed to reveal this. Preliminary research findings were published in the Guardian and readers were invited to comment on them. Guardian journalists’ experiences of comments were also surveyed. Both sets of responses are analysed here, in order to explore the contested nature of online abuse in an online news media environment, and to evaluate the potential of comments to “democratise” journalism.",,2018.0,67,48,2,True,,,,,,548,82371935,B.

549,Flaming Misogyny or Blindly Zealous Enforcement? The Bizarre Case of R V George,"This article examines the distinction between judicial reasoning flawed by errors on questions of law, properly addressed on appeal, and errors that constitute judicial misconduct and grounds for removal from the bench. Examples are from the transcripts and reasons for decision in R v George SKQB (2015), appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal (2016) and the Supreme Court of Canada (2017), and from the sentencing decision rendered by the same judge more than a decade earlier in R v Edmondson SKQB (2003). Both were sexual assault cases. In George a thirty-five year old woman with five children was tried and ultimately acquitted of sexual assault and sexual interference after she was assaulted in her home by a fourteen year old male. Striking similarities between the reasoning and language in the trial decision in George and the sentencing decision in Edmondson demonstrate entrenched antipathy for sexual assault law and the fundamental principles of justice, equality, and impartiality. This is arguably judicial misconduct, persisting despite access in the interim to many years of judicial education programming, not merely legal error. The problem does not lie with the judge alone, however. A toxic mix of misogyny and blindly zealous enforcement of the law appears to have undermined the administration of justice in George from the outset at all levels. The problems are systemic. Were this not the case, it is likely that Barbara George would not have been charged.",,2019.0,8,0,0,False,,,,,,549,48022277,Lucinda Vandervort,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,
550,Finding Global Homophily in Graph Neural Networks When Meeting Heterophily,"We investigate graph neural networks on graphs with heterophily. Some existing methods amplify a node’s neighborhood with multi-hop neighbors to include more nodes with homophily. How-ever, it is a signiﬁcant challenge to set personalized neighborhood sizes for different nodes. Further, for other homophilous nodes excluded in the neighborhood, they are ignored for information aggregation. To address these problems, we propose two models GloGNN and GloGNN++, which generate a node’s embedding by aggregating information from global nodes in the graph. In each layer, both models learn a coefﬁcient matrix to capture the correlations between nodes, based on which neighborhood aggregation is performed. The coefﬁcient matrix allows signed values and is derived from an optimization problem that has a closed-form solution. We further accelerate neighborhood aggregation and derive a linear time complexity. We theoretically explain the models’ effectiveness by proving that both the coefﬁcient matrix and the generated node embedding matrix have the desired grouping effect. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our models against 11 other competitors on 15 benchmark datasets in a wide range of domains, scales and graph heterophilies. Experimental results show that our methods achieve superior performance and are also very efﬁcient.",International Conference on Machine Learning,2022.0,33,22,5,False,"Two models GloGNN and GloGsNN++ are proposed, which generate a node’s embedding by aggregating information from global nodes in the graph by learning a coefﬁcient matrix to capture the correlations between nodes based on which neighborhood aggregation is performed.",,,,,550,47875796,Xiang Li,2029491250,Renyu Zhu,2165643958,Yao Cheng,145663545,Caihua Shan,3270262,Siqiang Luo,2119081394,Dongsheng Li,Computer Science,"JournalArticle, Conference"
551,Accumulation Crisis and Global Police State,"Global police state refers to three interrelated developments. First are the ever more omnipresent systems of mass social control, repression, and warfare promoted by the ruling groups to contain the real and the potential rebellion of the global working class and surplus humanity. Second is how the global economy is itself based more and more on the development and deployment of these systems of warfare, social control, and repression simply as a means of making profit and continuing to accumulate capital in the face of stagnation – what I term militarized accumulation, or accumulation by repression – and that now goes well beyond military Keynesianism. And third is the increasing move towards political systems that can be characterized as 21st century fascism, or even in a broader sense, as totalitarian. Digitalization makes possible the creation of a global police state. The mounting crisis appears to cement the emerging digital economy with the global police state. There is a triangulation of far-right, authoritarian, and neo-fascist forces in civil society, reactionary political power in the state, and transnational corporate capital, especially speculative finance capital, the military–industrial–security complex, and the extractive industries – all three interwoven with high-tech or digital capital.",,2019.0,47,25,1,True,,,,,,551,78630439,W.

552,When users control the algorithms: Values expressed in practices on the twitter platform,"© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Recent interest in ethical AI has brought a slew of values, including fairness, into conversations about technology design. Research in the area of algorithmic fairness tends to be rooted in questions of distribution that can be subject to precise formalism and technical implementation. We seek to expand this conversation to include the experiences of people subject to algorithmic classification and decision-making. By examining tweets about the “Twitter algorithm” we consider the wide range of concerns and desires Twitter users express. We find a concern with fairness (narrowly construed) is present, particularly in the ways users complain that the platform enacts a political bias against conservatives. However, we find another important category of concern, evident in attempts to exert control over the algorithm. Twitter users who seek control do so for a variety of reasons, many well justified. We argue for the need for better and clearer definitions of what constitutes legitimate and illegitimate control over algorithmic processes and to consider support for users who wish to enact their own collective choices.",,2019.0,0,1,0,False,It is argued for the need for better and clearer definitions of what constitutes legitimate and illegitimate control over algorithmic processes and to consider support for users who wish to enact their own collective choices.,,,,,552,48129731,J.

554,The Floating Head of Feminism: The Domesticated Domain and Erasure of the Female (No)body in Contemporary Television and Cinema,"The Floating Head of Feminism is a project that seeks to examine the concept of the abject as that which disobeys borders and blurs boundaries and to subsequently look at this conception through female-coded artificial intelligence. The AI abject is the part of the self that is cast off or removed so that one can claim an identity, which the abject, in turn, threatens. I discuss the importance of the female-coded AI’s digital embodiment in virtual spaces, and this idea is expanded on through an examination of the science-fiction film genre. This thesis serves to reveal the relationship of resistance between AIs and their male owners or inventors by examining contemporary cultural artifacts of the past two decades: Smart House, Pixel Perfect, and Her, ultimately exposing in these films that the construction of female-coded AI exists as a result of the male’s desire for dominance. By being excluded from the benefits of the symbolic realm, the AIs do not remain the passive bodies their owners and inventors desire them to be. Instead, they begin to represent qualities that their male humans solely want to recognize as part of their human selves. Through this examination, I determine that these qualities exist as traits that align with that which society deems conventionally masculine, such as taking on the role of the sole provider of familial burdens, suppressing the will of others in the name of self-interest, and meeting situations with hostility and defiance. The transgression of boundaries proves that it is woman, herself, and the female body that is abjected in these films and who always returns. Female-coded AIs pose an ideological threat to the men within their patriarchal film space and denote horror to their humanity, serving as the floating, feminine death of able-bodied masculinity.",,2018.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,554,40956109,Alicia Turner,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

The sex industry is no exception: For the makers of RealDoll, AI is poised to help meet customers’ most requested demand—bringing their sex dolls “to life.” Before the launch of their fully functional “sex robot,” the company encourages users to interact with “Harmony,” the AI at the heart of the technology, via its Android-based digital app. Though sex dolls have historically failed to alter sexual relations between humans, critics suggest that integrating AI technology demands researchers evaluate this prospect anew: Making sex dolls more lifelike—but not necessarily more realistic—could bolster negative gender stereotypes and erode cultural norms around sexuality. Though sex robots will undoubtedly be more than the sum of their parts, the experiences of Harmony app users provide a valuable entry point into this debate, offering empirical support for how people navigate intimate relationships with digital partners. Using qualitative content analysis, this study examines user discourse on the “Club RealDoll” forum to interrogate how the app engenders particular values or reinforces users’ preconceived attitudes about intimacy, consent and gender stereotypes. This data ultimately reveals how the app’s gamified format promotes a set of flawed internal ethics,",,2018.0,31,2,0,False,,,,,,555,2005140762,Ellen Kaufman,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
556,The Murky Ethics of Emoji: How Shall We Regulate a Web for Good?,"This paper builds on our earlier investigation in The Emoji Factor: Humanizing the Emerging Law of Digital Speech by exploring how the social media industry is responding to public demand to expand the emoji collection to reflect our individual differences. We consider the ethical fallout of those decisions by asking two research questions: 1) how are emoji changing to reflect human diversity; and 2) do the resulting designs breach laws or ethical norms with respect to privacy, human rights, or data security. Our methodology includes a comparative examination of research and new ‘personalized’ offerings by internet companies such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the standards board of the Unicode Consortium, to more accurately reflect emoji users’ physical, racial, age-related, and gender-based uniqueness. Our thesis is that through their graphic simplicity and broad accessibility, emoji are well placed as ambassadors of inclusion but we are challenged by the privacy invasions created by their data use by third parties and by a lack of algorithmic fairness in design choices imposed by artificial intelligence. We focus on examples involving the acceptance by the Unicode Consortium of certain emoji that raise ethical questions about their political messaging and machine biases that could discriminate on the basis of personal beliefs, convictions, race, age, or gender. We conclude that internet technology is a political and moral force and, as beneficiaries of its convenience, we have a responsibility to use ethical regulation to “rethink a Web that is truly inclusive and open, a Web for good.” Where better to begin than with that comedic, widely accessible, masterpiece of non-verbal speech: the emoji.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2019.0,50,0,0,False,"It is concluded that internet technology is a political and moral force and, as beneficiaries of its convenience, internet companies have a responsibility to use ethical regulation to “rethink a Web that is truly inclusive and open, a Web for good.”",,,"EA Kirley, M McMahon - Richmond Journal of Law and Technology …, 2019 - papers.ssrn.com","[{'name': 'EA Kirley', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WvZA8uEAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=WvZA8uEAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'WvZA8uEAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M McMahon', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ft0gSEQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Ft0gSEQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Ft0gSEQAAAAJ'}]",556,69472188,E.

557,"Minderheitenstress und psychische Gesundheit von Lesben, Schwulen und Bisexuellen","Introduction: According to the minority stress model (Meyer, 2003), a lesbian, gay, or bisexual orientation predicts mental health symptoms – mediated through minority stress. The model has been confirmed by a plethora of Western studies. The primary goals of this dissertation are to test in Germany for the first time for mental health differences between lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals (LGB) versus heterosexual individuals as well as to examine associations between minority stress and mental health symptoms. Method: Four manuscripts describe the investigation of data from four sexual-minority convenience samples, a heterosexual convenience sample, and a population-based male sample. Data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and 24. Results: LGB reported more mental health problems than heterosexuals. While a minority sexual identity predicted minority stress (or sexual identity stress), minority stress predicted mental health symptoms. Group-based coping and social support did not moderate these predictions. Furthermore, a small percentage of heterosexuals reported sexual identity stress. Discussion: This dissertation confirms several assumptions regarding the minority stress model and discredited others. I thus propose the use of an adapted minority stress model that future studies should examine. Minority stress should be alleviated around the world to improve mental health in LGB.%%%%Einleitung: Laut dem Minderheitenstressmodell (Meyer, 2003) sagt eine lesbische, schwule oder bisexuelle Orientierung, mediiert uber Minderheitenstressoren, psychische Symptome vorher.

Methode: Es wurden vier Manuskripte erstellt, die Daten aus vier Ad-hoc-Stichproben sexueller Minderheiten, einer heterosexuellen Ad-hoc-Stichprobe und einer reprasentativen, mannlichen Stichprobe untersuchten. Die Datenanalysen wurden mit IBM SPSS Statistics 22 und 24 durchgefuhrt. Ergebnisse: LSB gaben mehr psychische Symptome als Heterosexuelle an.

Gruppenbezogenes Coping und soziale Unterstutzung moderierten die Zusammenhange nicht. Zudem berichtete ein kleiner Anteil Heterosexueller von erlebtem sexuellem Identitatsstress. Diskussion: Der Kumulus bestatigt mehrere Vorhersagen des Minderheitenstressmodells und widerlegt andere.

To address this gap in the literature, we meta-analyzed the magnitude of sex and race differences in perceptions of workplace mistreatment (e.g., harassment, discrimination, bullying, incivility). Results indicate that women perceive more sex-based mistreatment (i.e., mistreatment that explicitly targets a person’s sex) in the workplace than men (&dgr; = .46; k = 43), whereas women and men report comparable perceptions of all other forms of mistreatment (&dgr; = .02; k = 300). Similarly, although racial minorities perceive more race-based mistreatment (i.e., mistreatment that explicitly targets a person’s race) in the workplace than Whites (&dgr; = .71; k = 18), results indicate smaller race differences in all other forms of workplace mistreatment (&dgr; = .10; k = 61).

564,"Adolescents’ Sex-Related Alcohol Expectancies and Alcohol Advertisements in Magazines: The Role of Wishful Identification, Realism, and Beliefs about Women’s Enjoyment of Sexualization","In the United States, approximately one in five sexually active teens report alcohol or drug use before their last sexual encounter. The co-occurrence of alcohol with sex increases risky behaviors, such as having unprotected sex. Magazines that target adolescents often feature alcohol advertisements with sexual innuendo and female objectification. Such advertisements may inform adolescents’ expectancies that alcohol can facilitate sex. With an experimental design and path analysis, we examined 874 adolescents’ (ages 15–17, M = 16.05) exposure to objectifying alcohol ads, their perceptions of the ads, and their attitudes about women’s sexualization in relation to sex-related alcohol expectancies. For female adolescents we assessed their enjoyment of sexualization, and for male adolescents, we assessed their perceived enjoyment of sexualization among women. Teens’ perceptions that alcohol ads promote the co-occurrence of alcohol with sex mediated the effect of ad exposure and perceived realism of the ads on sex-related alcohol expectancies. The enjoyment of sexualization construct mediated the effect of wishful identification and perceived realism on sex-related alcohol expectancies. Wishful identification also directly related to sex-related alcohol expectancies. Results challenge the alcohol industry’s compliance with advertisement regulations and suggest media literacy as a strategy to promote healthy sex-related alcohol expectancies among adolescents.",Journal of health communication,2019.0,61,5,0,False,Teens’ perceptions that alcohol ads promote the co-occurrence of alcohol with sex mediated the effect of ad exposure and perceived realism of the ads on sex-related alcohol expectancies.,,,,,564,34027587,K.

567,Exploring Perceived Emotional Intelligence of Personality-Driven Virtual Agents in Handling User Challenges,"An effective virtual agent (VA) that serves humans not only completes tasks efficaciously, but also manages its interpersonal relationships with users judiciously. Although past research has studied how agents apologize or seek help appropriately, there lacks a comprehensive study of how to design an emotionally intelligent (EI) virtual agent. In this paper, we propose to improve a VA's perceived EI by equipping it with personality-driven responsive expression of emotions. We conduct a within-subject experiment to verify this approach using a medical assistant VA. We ask participants to observe how the agent (displaying a dominant or submissive trait, or having no personality) handles user challenges when issuing reminders and rate its EI. Results show that simply being emotionally expressive is insufficient for suggesting VAs as fully emotionally intelligent. Equipping such VAs with a consistent, distinctive personality trait (especially submissive) can convey a significantly stronger sense of EI in terms of the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions, and can better mitigate user challenges.",The Web Conference,2019.0,113,17,5,True,"It is proposed to improve a VA's perceived EI by equipping it with personality-driven responsive expression of emotions, which can convey a significantly stronger sense of EI in terms of the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions.",,,,,567,3230330,Xiaojuan Ma,2075453390,Emily P.

568,A systematic review of the relationship between religion and attitudes toward transgender and gender-variant people,"Abstract Background: Prejudice against transgender people is widespread, yet in spite of the prevalence of this negativity relatively little is known about the antecedents and predictors of these attitudes. One factor that is commonly related to prejudice is religion, and this is especially true for prejudice targets that are considered to be “value violating” (as is the case for transgender individuals). Method: In this paper, we present the findings of our systematic search of the literature on this topic and present the synthesized evidence. Our search strategy was conducted across five databases and yielded 29 studies (across 28 articles). Results: We found consistent evidence that self-identifying as with either being “religious” or as Christian (and to a lesser extent, being Muslim) was associated with increased transprejudice relative to being nonreligious (and to a lesser extent, being Jewish). Additionally, we found consistent evidence that certain forms of religiosity were also related to transprejudice – specifically religious fundamentalism, church attendance, and interpretations of the bible as literal (transprejudice was unrelated to religious education). Conclusion: Although this young, but important field of research is growing, more empirical exploration is needed to fully understand that nuances of the religion-transprejudice relationship.",International Journal of Transgenderism,2019.0,102,81,1,False,"Consistent evidence is found that self-identifying as with either being “religious” or as Christian (and to a lesser extent, being Muslim) was associated with increased transprejudice relative to being nonreligious ( and to a greater extent,being Jewish).",,"[{'title': 'nih.gov', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6830999/'}, {'title': 'View it @ CTU', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:8YF24UeyW_0J:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&num=20&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=2018&as_yhi=2019&scillfp=18197208441630832790&oi=lle'}]","M Campbell, JDX Hinton… - International Journal of …, 2019 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'JDX Hinton', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y3MppHMAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Y3MppHMAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Y3MppHMAAAAJ'}]",568,153665860,Marianne Campbell,152489369,J.

569,Diversity Course Effectiveness Among Criminal Justice Students,"Most universities today require their students to learn about diversity as a part of their degree. Research has examined the effectiveness of diversity courses at changing attitudes toward groups, focusing on sexism or racism, within psychology and women’s studies disciplines. Given the increasing concern over bias in policing, however, this diversity training may be of importance to the study of criminal justice. The current study aims to examine the effectiveness of a diversity course within a criminal justice program at changing perceptions of groups using a survey based on validated measures of attitudes toward women, homosexuality, and symbolic racism. Change in attitudes between the pre-test and post-test are examined. Results suggest that the course is effective at changing attitudes toward homosexuality, but not race or sex. The results also suggest that these perceptions are dependent on group characteristics.",,2018.0,59,4,0,False,,,,,,569,40409110,Michele Stacey,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,Review
570,"No Local Birth Sex Ratio Changes following the August 2019 Shootings in Montgomery County, Ohio, and in El Paso County, Texas","Objective: In humans, males are born slightly in excess of females. Many factors have been shown to affect this ratio, including stressful events such as terrorist attacks. Two shootings occurred in early August 2019 in the Oregon District in Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, and in El Paso County, Texas, in the USA. This study was carried out in order to identify whether there were any effects on sex ratio at birth at the state or county level 3–5 months later. Subject and Methods: Births by sex, month of birth (2015–2019), and county were obtained for Ohio and Texas from the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ordinary linear logistic regression was used to assess the time trend in the probability of boys and to investigate changes in the trend functions. Poisson regression (SAS GENMOD) and linear logistic regression using SAS procedure LOGISTIC was applied. Results: This study analyzed 2,623,714 live births, 1,939,938 in Texas (sex odds [SO] 1.044) and 683,776 in Ohio (SO 1.045). The only significant effect noted was seasonality (month) at the state level. Conclusion: It has been postulated that male fetal loss in pregnant women during stressful periods may occur in accordance with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Several studies have found significant effects after terrorist attacks in the USA (as well as in other countries), but this study did not reveal such effects. This may be due to several reasons including underpowered datasets and the possibility that populations may be becoming relatively immured to these events.",Medical Principles and Practice,2021.0,26,2,0,True,"It has been postulated that male fetal loss in pregnant women during stressful periods may occur in accordance with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, but this study did not reveal such effects.",,,,,570,97923678,V.

571,CryptGPU: Fast Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning on the GPU,"We introduce CryptGPU, a system for privacy-preserving machine learning that implements all operations on the GPU (graphics processing unit). Just as GPUs played a pivotal role in the success of modern deep learning, they are also essential for realizing scalable privacy-preserving deep learning. In this work, we start by introducing a new interface to losslessly embed cryptographic operations over secret-shared values (in a discrete domain) into floating-point operations that can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA kernels for linear algebra. We then identify a sequence of ""GPU-friendly"" cryptographic protocols to enable privacy-preserving evaluation of both linear and non-linear operations on the GPU. Our microbenchmarks indicate that our private GPU-based convolution protocol is over 150× faster than the analogous CPU-based protocol; for non-linear operations like the ReLU activation function, our GPU-based protocol is around 10× faster than its CPU analog. With CryptGPU, we support private inference and training on convolutional neural networks with over 60 million parameters as well as handle large datasets like ImageNet. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, our protocols achieve a 2× to 8× improvement in private inference for large networks and datasets. For private training, we achieve a 6× to 36× improvement over prior state-of-the-art. Our work not only showcases the viability of performing secure multiparty computation (MPC) entirely on the GPU to newly enable fast privacy-preserving machine learning, but also highlights the importance of designing new MPC primitives that can take full advantage of the GPU’s computing capabilities.",IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,2021.0,61,49,14,True,"This work introduces CRYPTGPU, a system for privacypreserving machine learning that implements all operations on the GPU, and introduces a new interface to losslessly embed cryptographic operations over secret-shared values into floating-point operations that can be processed by highly-optimized CUDA kernels for linear algebra.",,,,,571,2110171928,Sijun Tan,2713842,Brian Knott,151316967,Yuan Tian,25629078,David J.

572,President or Predator? The Social Construction of Donald Trump in a Divided America,"ABSTRACT During the presidential election, numerous women accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and/or assault. Then a presidential candidate, he denied these complaints and said the women were all untruthful – a position he has continued to espouse. To explore “who the public believes,” we commissioned YouGov to conduct an opt-in online survey of a national sample of 1,000 Americans. Notably, half of Americans (51.0%) believed that “the women are telling the truth when they reported that Mr. Trump sexually harassed or assaulted them” versus 23.1% who sided with the president. Nearly two-thirds (64.9%) stated that it was unlikely that all the women were lying, and 3 in 5 Americans (60.5%) supported President Trump’s impeachment by the U.S. Congress if these accusations could be proven. Informed by research on political psychology (especially Haidt’s The Righteous Mind), the data are explored to see why Americans embrace divergent moral narratives – with some seeing Mr. Trump as a truthful president and others seeing him as a predator unworthy of the office he holds.",Crime and Justice in the Trump Era,2019.0,89,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'View it @ CTU', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:CDEiwHj4-KAJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&num=20&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=2018&as_yhi=2019&scillfp=9802950744171754188&oi=lle'}]","TC Kulig, FT Cullen, M Haner - Victims & Offenders, 2019 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'TC Kulig', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tKU4tBoAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=tKU4tBoAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'tKU4tBoAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'FT Cullen', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zpxZFNUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=zpxZFNUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'zpxZFNUAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Haner', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9e3qxj8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=9e3qxj8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '9e3qxj8AAAAJ'}]",572,6041812,T.

573,"Smoldering in the darkness: contextualizing learning, technology, and politics under the weight of ongoing fear and nationalism","When we first envisioned this issue’s theme, in the early months of 2017, we did so expecting this to be a collection of scholarship reflecting back on a moment of historical tension and pronounced hand-wringing about technology, learning, and the sociopolitical state of things globally. Instead, we find ourselves now in a political context where even people in dominant groups are in disbelief that presumed safeguards for democracy and assumptions about ‘common’ decency are failing. This issue presents research exploring how the current nationalist and oppressive sociopolitical environment – seen globally – shapes youth identities and learning practices in both formal and informal environments. We have curated this work in order to interrogate how learning and the role of technology are affected by and have created a political climate that continues to lead to a rise in global far-right movements, such as those in evidence in the wake of prominent recent events like Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As guest editors in the U.S., we are particularly cognizant of a localized context in which a successful presidential campaign was built on foundations of racism (Kendall 2016), religious intolerance (Rosenberg and Ainsley 2016), sexual assault (Burns, Haberman, and Martin 2016), misogyny (Khazan 2016), xenophobia (Sargent 2016), and a disregard for science and the environment. Two years into Trump’s presidency, we see these themes continuing to cause harm in classrooms and to families (Garcia and Dutro 2018). Rather than see the slinging of damaging rhetoric as a momentary blip from which our research community can learn, we write this noting that governments inflict increasing harm today than when we first proposed this issue—particularly to youth of color and to the most vulnerable communities globally including refugees, members of the LGBTQ community, and children. We continued to sense a belief in our academic communities (despite the historical evidence to the contrary) that the future held the promise of improvement and that if we sheltered in place for the time being, the work of others – activists, researchers, policy makers, and educators – would sort things out in a timely fashion. Rather than looking back at a momentary suffering vis-à-vis sociopolitical contexts of education, technology, and learning, we are roiling in the present. We write this acknowledging that the vast majority of educational—particularly classroomspecific—research is conducted now without acknowledging the sociopolitical contexts that press on the lives of youth today. As students sit in schools within the U.S., they are presented with reminders that youth are presently in cages, are victims of violence and unarmed deaths, and are foisted into debates of the morality of alleged sexual assault. To consider improving student learning outcomes, we must first acknowledge the substantial damage that is being incurred by both the blindness of schools to the healing needs of youth (Zembylas 2007) and the normative approaches of educational research on vulnerable communities (Tuck 2009). Further, we note that the words, policies, and violence prevalent in global contexts is not bound to the whims or motives of individuals; we see today’s political actions—internationally – shaping the landscape of learning and technology long after the administration of individual leaders. As a result, the papers in this issue explore the broader landscape of the current political climate, rather than focusing exclusively on specific figures and events. It is our hope that they provoke renewed conversations about the intersections of learning, engagement, and resistance.",Journal of Educational Media,2018.0,60,4,0,True,,,,,,573,46296251,Antero Garcia,48026918,T.

574,How women living with HIV react and respond to learning about Canadian law that criminalises HIV non-disclosure: ‘how do you prove that you told?’,"Abstract The Women, ART and the Criminalization of HIV Study is a qualitative, arts-based research study focusing on the impact of the HIV non-disclosure law on women living with HIV in Canada. The federal law requires people living with HIV to disclose their HIV-positive status to sexual partners before engaging in sexual activities that pose what the Supreme Court of Canada called a ‘realistic possibility of transmission’. Drawing on findings from seven education and discussion sessions with 48 women living with HIV regarding HIV non-disclosure laws in Canada, this paper highlights the ways in which women living with HIV respond to learning about the criminalisation of HIV non-disclosure. The most common emergent themes included: the way the law reproduces social and legal injustices; gendered experiences of intimate injustice; and the relationship between disclosure and violence against women living with HIV. These discussions illuminate the troubling consequences inherent in a law that is antithetical to the science of HIV transmission risk, and that fails to acknowledge the multiple barriers to HIV disclosure that women living with HIV experience. Women’s experiences also highlight the various ways the law contributes to their experiences of sexism, racism and other forms of marginalisation in society.","Culture, Health and Sexuality",2019.0,43,14,0,True,"This paper highlights the ways in which women living with HIV respond to learning about the criminalisation of HIV non-disclosure, and the most common emergent themes included: the way the law reproduces social and legal injustices; gendered experiences of intimate injustice; and the relationship between disclosure and violence against womenliving with HIV.",,,,,574,80011799,S.

Retribution-style IBSA encompasses abusive behaviours such as covert intimate filming or photography, the non-consensual storage of a victim’s intimate images, threats to disseminate such images and the actual dissemination of a victim’s intimate images. The harms of victimisation include significant emotional distress, job loss, and physical and online stalking and harassment by internet users who viewed their intimate images. Due to the ubiquity and permanence of the internet, retribution-style IBSA victims cannot be guaranteed that their intimate images would not resurface in future. This study aims to establish an evidence base for retribution-style IBSA. The crimecommission process of retribution-style IBSA is investigated using crime script analysis. The components of IBSA target selection are detailed using the components in the CRAVED framework, and barriers to prevention, tactical and strategic approaches for IBSA prevention are identified using a thematic analysis of 4 semi-structured interviews and 18 court transcripts.

This interdisciplinary research utilizes innovative, historical narratives (Morris-Suzuki,1988, Hornyak 2006), and the socio-cultural milieu of Japan and its traditions (Allison 2013; Katsuno 2010) to further appreciate and acknowledge Japanese perspectives and thought on AI and robotics and their uses. Furthermore, investigating government-issued publications (Innovation 25; New Robot Strategy; Japan Revitalization Strategy), and contemporary literature by AI field experts (Harari 2017; Bostrom 2017; Frase 2016), this paper argues that Japan’s futurist visions do not take into account the problematic ramifications of AI. In so doing, this paper critically reimagines a best response and re-envisioning of an unfolding and possible future. Research findings may also hold significance in other cultural and national contexts, particularly in nations with shrinking and aging populations, class stratification, and ethnic and techno-nationalism(s).

582,Cross-Talks Between Macro- and Micronutrient Uptake and Signaling in Plants,"In nature, land plants as sessile organisms are faced with multiple nutrient stresses that often occur simultaneously in soil. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) are five of the essential nutrients that affect plant growth and health. Although these minerals are relatively inaccessible to plants due to their low solubility and relative immobilization, plants have adopted coping mechanisms for survival under multiple nutrient stress conditions. The double interactions between N, Pi, S, Zn, and Fe have long been recognized in plants at the physiological level. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying these cross-talks in plants remain poorly understood. This review preliminarily examined recent progress and current knowledge of the biochemical and physiological interactions between macro- and micro-mineral nutrients in plants and aimed to focus on the cross-talks between N, Pi, S, Zn, and Fe uptake and homeostasis in plants. More importantly, we further reviewed current studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talks between N, Pi, S, Zn, and Fe homeostasis to better understand how these nutrient interactions affect the mineral uptake and signaling in plants. This review serves as a basis for further studies on multiple nutrient stress signaling in plants. Overall, the development of an integrative study of multiple nutrient signaling cross-talks in plants will be of important biological significance and crucial to sustainable agriculture.",Frontiers in Plant Science,2021.0,211,24,0,True,"Current studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talks between N, Pi, S, Zn, and Fe homeostasis are reviewed to better understand how these nutrient interactions affect the mineral uptake and signaling in plants.",,,,,582,49537330,Xiaoning Fan,2109642768,Xiaoqin Zhou,2155549616,Hui Chen,144276307,M.

This article describes the development and initial validation of the Domestic Violence Myth Acceptance Scale (DVMAS). In the first study, an initial pool of 80 items was evaluated and an 18-item instrument constructed. A second validation study indicated that the DVMAS had excellent reliability (alpha = .88) and good face and content validity as well as good indications of convergent, construct, and known groups validity. Divergent validity was only partially supported. The studies also indicated that domestic violence myths serve individual psychological functions as well as social functions related to blaming the victim, exonerating the perpetrator, and minimizing the violence.",,2008.0,59,112,32,False,,,,,,583,48667609,J.

This article examines the cement of hatred in light of the 2016 election of Donald Trump. It briefly discusses Andrew Samuel’s “action ethos” as a Jungian political response; Jung’s thoughts on emotion, conflict, and consciousness as they pertain to individuation; and the notion of the cultural complex developed by Singer and Kimbles. This framework is deepened with a short meditation on mythic Chaos and its close relationship with Eros as a generative, formative, and connecting principle. The last half of the article reaches across a disciplinary boundary to employ three principles of complexity science to understand Trump’s election and the world it has shaped: unpredictability, bifurcation, and autopoeisis.

587,Physical violence and psychological abuse against female and male mayors in the United States,"ABSTRACT Despite reports of physical violence and psychological abuse against US officeholders, the subject has not been addressed in research at any level of government. This study reports results from survey research of mayors with three aims: examination of the frequency, types, and correlates of experiences of physical violence and psychological abuse among mayors; exploration of gender differences; and estimates of the effects of violence and abuse on mayors’ desire to stay in office. Our findings suggest that US mayors face meaningful levels of physical violence and psychological abuse – and these events are widespread across types of cities. Our data also show that female mayors are more likely than men to experience most types of violence and abuse. And, although having these experiences did not reduce the majority of officeholders’ political ambition, those who suffered physical violence were more likely than those who faced psychological abuse to have considered curtailing their political careers. Finally, we consider the implications for these results on the quality and diversity of future representation.","Politics, Groups, and Identities",2019.0,96,14,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'mlkrook.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'http://mlkrook.org/pdf/Herrick.pdf'}]","…, S Thomas, L Franklin, ML Godwin… - Politics, Groups, and …, 2019 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'ML Godwin', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9WiNhQkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=9WiNhQkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '9WiNhQkAAAAJ'}]",587,40293708,R.

Across three studies the initial psychometric evidence is presented: An exploratory factor analysis suggested that the 16 items of the PAAS accurately factor onto the two hypothesized subscales (Study 1), which was ratified using a confirmatory factor analysis (Study 2). The presented reliability estimates (internal consistency: Studies 1–3; test-retest reliability: Study 3) verified the stability of the measure. Finally, evidence of the validity for the scale (criterion, construct, and known-groups; Study 2) and for the independent predictive validity of each subscale is presented.

Herein, we examine how the conservative agenda of Mr Temer and his supporters is influencing key decisions in the human rights and public health arena in Brazil. The government’s austerity agenda includes severe cuts in critical areas such as health, education and science, jeopardising well-known strategies such as the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) and nationwide cash transfer program, ‘Bolsa Familia’ – both benefited millions and were the largest of their kind in the world. Mr Temer’s decisions show not only severe cuts in critical areas but also a political agenda that clearly demonstrates a broad shift away from the progressivism and social agenda presented and supported by its predecessors. Most vulnerable groups such as the LGBTQ community, women, people who use drugs and disenfranchised communities have been severely affected. Mr Temer’s administration is putting Brazil far from its once nationwide goal to foster free and universal health care access and social equity for all its citizens. The near future for Brazil is unknown, but both national and international communities anticipate severe problems within the national human rights arena, if nothing changes.

The data consist of two textbooks, and we investigate what kinds of teaching, learning and knowledge the textbooks construct and what kinds of student and teacher positions they suggest. The inquiry shows that learning in the textbooks is seen as a strictly defined, hierarchical process and that ideal teaching stresses methods over content. The power of knowledge is not discussed, nor are gender, sexuality and other differences. Academics are seen as professional teachers who master teaching methods, and students are framed as customers. An assumed human sameness, marketisation of education, emphasis on vocational benefit and ‘pathos of the new’ were found to be themes guiding mainstream pedagogy. We suggest that feminist pedagogy can offer an alternative approach, one enabling a critical analysis of the power of knowledge and an awareness of differences among students.",,2019.0,86,5,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'ulapland.fi', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://lacris.ulapland.fi/ws/portalfiles/portal/5964749/Mainstream_univeristy_pedagogy_Naskali_Keskitalo_Foley.pdf'}]","P Naskali, S Keskitalo-Foley - Gender and Education, 2019 - Taylor & Francis",,599,2095566675,Päivi Naskali,2099282348,Seija Keskitalo-Foley,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
600,Everything you wanted to know about smart cities: The Internet of things is the backbone,"This article is a single-source introduction to the emerging concept of smart cities. It can be used for familiarizing researchers with the vast scope of research possible in this application domain. The smart city is primarily a concept, and there is still not a clear and consistent definition among practitioners and academia. As a simplistic explanation, a smart city is a place where traditional networks and services are made more flexible, efficient, and sustainable with the use of information, digital, and telecommunication technologies to improve the city's operations for the benefit of its inhabitants. Smart cities are greener, safer, faster, and friendlier. The different components of a smart city include smart infrastructure, smart transportation, smart energy, smart health care, and smart technology. These components are what make the cities smart and efficient. Information and communication technology (ICT) are enabling keys for transforming traditional cities into smart cities. Two closely related emerging technology frameworks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data (BD), make smart cities efficient and responsive. The technology has matured enough to allow smart cities to emerge. However, there is much needed in terms of physical infrastructure, a smart city, the digital technologies translate into better public services for inhabitants and better use of resources while reducing environmental impacts. One of the formal definitions of the smart city is the following: a city ""connecting the physical infrastructure, the information-technology infrastructure, the social infrastructure, and the business infrastructure to leverage the collective intelligence of the city"". Another formal and comprehensive definition is ""a smart sustainable city is an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operations and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects"".

In the history of the Italian LGBTQI+ movement, three moments in particular can be identified that have led from the first revolutionary homosexual front (FUORI), an anti-institutional one, to the foundation of a structured and organized, and then institutionalized, movement both at a local and national level: 1974–1985, a founding moment; 1996–2000, a re-founding moment; 2016–2018, a reconfiguration moment.

Moreover, hypothesized correlations between YoDA scores and intergroup closeness, awareness of discrimination, distress over discrimination, and knowledge of bias were also found. In Study 2, a single-factor confirmatory factor analysis was run on data provided by 112 high school youth who participated in the same program. Although the analysis provided limited support for the single-factor solution, a subsequent exploratory factor analysis indicated that the single-factor solution was appropriate for the data.

Microaggressions are brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership (people of color, women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBTs)). The primary attempt is to demonstrate how these microaggressions affect every area life for the African American male, and that these ""subtle, stunning, often automatic, and nonverbal exchanges which are 'put-downs'"" (Sue, 2010) directed toward people of color, often automatically or unconsciously by his White counterparts, must be recognized by both the victim as well as the perpetrator, in order to facilitate any type of resolution.",,2012.0,0,6,0,False,,,,,,608,113955494,Nathaniel Granger,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

(2010). Sexual offending in groups: An evaluation. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 15(2), 87–99.) to more fully inform explanations of different types of interpersonal violent crime. First, factors within the sociocultural and situational contexts of the model are reviewed, as well as the interactions between them and the individual context, to examine their role in explaining a broad range of violent crimes. Exemplars of street-gang and intimate partner violence are then examined to assess how the empirical evidence supports the proposed framework. It is concluded that the adapted multifactorial model lays the foundations for fuller causal explanations of violent crime without restricting the focus to a specific crime type, or level of explanation, in addition to bridging interdisciplinary theoretical gaps.","Psychology, Crime and Law",2018.0,109,7,0,False,,,,"L Dixon, L Harkins, D Wegerhoff - Psychology, Crime & Law, 2019 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'L Dixon', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=acUu1hkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=acUu1hkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'acUu1hkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'D Wegerhoff', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bMZ_5LUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=bMZ_5LUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'bMZ_5LUAAAAJ'}]",609,49183458,L.

610,Hearing “That’s So Gay” and “No Homo” on Campus and Substance Use Among Sexual Minority College Students,"ABSTRACT Sexual orientation microaggressions are common on college campuses and can contribute to negative outcomes; yet little is known about their relationship with substance use outcomes. Among a convenience sample of cisgender sexual minority college students (n= 574; 57.0% female, 24.9% people of color, 50.7% gay/lesbian; 72.4% public school) from 37 states (67.8% Midwest), this analysis investigates the association between hearing “that’s so gay” and “no homo” on campus and hazardous alcohol use and the frequency of illicit drug use.

612,Forecasting Stock Exchange Data using Group Method of Data Handling Neural Network Approach,"The increasing uncertainty of the natural world has motivated computer scientists to seek out the best approach to technological problems. Nature-inspired problem-solving approaches include meta-heuristic methods that are focused on evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence. One of these problems significantly impacting information is forecasting exchange index, which is a serious concern with the growth and decline of stock as there are many reports on loss of financial resources or profitability. When the exchange includes an extensive set of diverse stock, particular concepts and mechanisms for physical security, network security, encryption, and permissions should guarantee and predict its future needs. This study aimed to show it is efficient to use the group method of data handling (GMDH)-type neural networks and their application for the classification of numerical results. Such modeling serves to display the precision of GMDH-type neural networks. Following the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in April 2018, the behavior of the stock exchange data stream and commend algorithms has not been able to predict correctly and fit in the network satisfactorily.

615,"The Association between Social Dominance Orientation, Critical Consciousness, and Gender Minority Stigma","ABSTRACT Transgender people are exposed to great amounts of discrimination and violence, but research has yet to fully understand what drives stigma towards this community. In this study, we hypothesized that social dominance orientation would be associated with greater gender minority stigma (i.e., stigmatizing views of transgender people), with this association mediated by higher levels of trait aggression and lower levels of critical consciousness. Data were collected online from 254 cisgender individuals (158 women, 96 men; M age = 30.81 years). Social dominance orientation was associated with higher levels of gender minority stigma. Trait aggression was not a significant mediator of this association. However, there was a significant indirect effect via lowered critical consciousness (B = 0.10, SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.17).

Virginia Commonwealth University 2019 Director: Dr. Les Harrison, Associate Professor and Director of MA, Department of English This thesis examines narrative representation of female characters in video games and how game narratives and representations contribute to socio-cultural discourse. First, this thesis explores and defines the cultural background for female representation in video games. It then defines video games as a type of text and describes the features that are unique to games, such as the use of avatars, and what impacts these features have on game narratives. The thesis attempts to establish evidence of an evolutionary arc of comprehensive female representation in video games by first exploring historical female narrative tropes, and then comparing them to narrative case studies of female characters within five recent game titles (Tomb Raider, Bayonetta, Dragon Age, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, and Horizon: Zero Dawn). In these case studies, the implications for their representations of female characters are analyzed in the context of sociocultural discourse. Furthermore, this thesis argues for the importance of diverse representation within video games as a form of media, and as cultural objects that contribute to social discourse.",,2019.0,46,1,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'vcu.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6906&context=etd'}]",R Lucas - 2019 - scholarscompass.vcu.edu,,616,30237208,Rowan Lucas,,,,,,,,,,,History,
617,My life is a mess: self-deprecating relatability and collective identities in the memification of student issues,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we investigate memes about student issues. We consider the memes as expressions of a new networked student public that contain discourses that may fall outside the mainstream discourse on higher education. The paper is based on content analysis of 179 posts in the public Facebook Group ‘Student Problem Memes’, combined with a nine-month media watch and a discussion workshop with 15 students. Through self-deprecating humour, students create an inverse attention economy of competitive one-downmanship, where the goal is to display humorous failure instead of perfect appearance. Our analysis shows that students use humour to express, share, and commiserate over daily struggles, but also that the problems related to work/study balance and mental health, are experienced as a persistent feature of student living. We also analyse limitations of meme-based publics, emphasizing processes of inclusion and exclusion through specific vernaculars of visual and discursive humour where issues related to gender, race, orientation, class, and ability are sidelined in favour of relatable humour.",,2018.0,71,37,3,False,,,,,,617,3444797,Kristine Ask,51236259,C.

A gender balanced sample (N = 200) of participants read a six-page fabricated grand theft of a motor vehicle or shoplifting trial transcript, in which we manipulated defendant gender. Results did not support the prediction that a woman charged with shoplifting and a man charged with auto theft would yield harsher decisions among same-gender mock jurors. However, there was a significant juror gender by crime-type interaction effect on defendant impressions. For jurors who were women, shoplifting was associated with more positive defendant impressions, with no such effect for men.

619,"Antidiscrimination Laws, Artificial Intelligence, and Gender Bias: A Case Study in Nonmortgage Fintech Lending","Problem definition: We use a realistically large, publicly available data set from a global fintech lender to simulate the impact of different antidiscrimination laws and their corresponding data management and model-building regimes on gender-based discrimination in the nonmortgage fintech lending setting. Academic/practical relevance: Our paper extends the conceptual understanding of model-based discrimination from computer science to a realistic context that simulates the situations faced by fintech lenders in practice, where advanced machine learning (ML) techniques are used with high-dimensional, feature-rich, highly multicollinear data. We provide technically and legally permissible approaches for firms to reduce discrimination across different antidiscrimination regimes whilst managing profitability. Methodology: We train statistical and ML models on a large and realistically rich publicly available data set to simulate different antidiscrimination regimes and measure their impact on model quality and firm profitability. We use ML explainability techniques to understand the drivers of ML discrimination. Results: We find that regimes that prohibit the use of gender (like those in the United States) substantially increase discrimination and slightly decrease firm profitability. We observe that ML models are less discriminatory, of better predictive quality, and more profitable compared with traditional statistical models like logistic regression. Unlike omitted variable bias—which drives discrimination in statistical models—ML discrimination is driven by changes in the model training procedure, including feature engineering and feature selection, when gender is excluded. We observe that down sampling the training data to rebalance gender, gender-aware hyperparameter selection, and up sampling the training data to rebalance gender all reduce discrimination, with varying trade-offs in predictive quality and firm profitability. Probabilistic gender proxy modeling (imputing applicant gender) further reduces discrimination with negligible impact on predictive quality and a slight increase in firm profitability. Managerial implications: A rethink is required of the antidiscrimination laws, specifically with respect to the collection and use of protected attributes for ML models. Firms should be able to collect protected attributes to, at minimum, measure discrimination and ideally, take steps to reduce it. Increased data access should come with greater accountability for firms.",Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,2022.0,29,1,0,False,"This paper provides technically and legally permissible approaches for firms to reduce discrimination across different antidiscrimination regimes whilst managing profitability, and observes that ML models are less discriminatory, of better predictive quality, and more profitable compared with traditional statistical models like logistic regression.",,,,,619,102527631,Stephanie Kelley,2007135265,Anton Ovchinnikov,1763894,D.

620,An Uber ethical dilemma: examining the social issues at stake,"
Purpose
This paper aims to engage with the social issues emerging from the increasing reliance upon app-driven services, as they pertain to precarious labor and ethical standpoints in a digital era. Popular ride services such as Uber have been lauded for bringing much needed transportation services that are superior to expensive taxis or unpleasant or inaccessible public transit.


Design/methodology/approach
As a result of over three years of ongoing research and analysis, this paper is a comprehensive assessment of a number of social issues facing the integration of practices both signified and enacted in an economy driven by apps such as Uber. While these companies are indeed profitable, questions remain as to just how much of a panacea these practices actually herald.


Findings
Findings indicate that privatization and a lack of labor regulation may present a significant savings to the user, but full cost economics suggest that the social and environmental costs require consideration.


Research limitations/implications
The recommendations here refer to the ethical considerations forwarded in this paper and serve to open up dialog to further discuss the persistent issues facing a precarious future.


Practical implications
In terms of practical implications, there is a point of tension between governmental/regulatory bodies, disruptive innovators and users.


Social implications
Stakeholders of all stripes are scrambling to keep up with the pace and problematics of digital innovations and an inclusive critical dialog on app-driven services has yet to become a priority.


Originality/value
The original value of this analytical framework from a social justice perspective stands to catalyze action on a number of pervasive social issues surrounding digital ethics and policy.

622,Unfolding female quiet in wargames: gender bias in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain from representation to gameplay,"Abstract This article investigates the cultural mediatization of the relationship between gender and war by looking at the representation and agency of female presence in one of the most popular sagas in video games: Metal Gear Solid. We have specifically focused on the last chapter of the series, Metal Gear Solid V (MGS5) by putting under scrutiny the character of Quiet. The analysis draws upon the rich theoretical corpus of feminist film studies, with reference to two main concepts: the “visual pleasure” by Laura Mulvey and the “female voice” by Kaja Silverman. These analytic tools are employed in order to scrutinize both the visual representation and the design of the game. We argue that MGS5 is a relevant instance of a large part of gaming production that develops a war imagery characterized by (a) the exploitation of women and (b) an employment of female body as a tool to fulfill the visual pleasure of the male gaze. The figure of Quiet, with the oversexualization of her body and the deprivation of her voice, is particularly telling in this respect. Our analysis aims to identify effective solutions in order to think about more inclusive digital games able to address conflictual issues without surrendering to sexism.",,2019.0,53,2,0,False,,,,"E Gandolfi, M Sciannamblo - Feminist Media Studies, 2019 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'E Gandolfi', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sOD-06oAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=sOD-06oAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'sOD-06oAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Sciannamblo', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J11YdF4AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=J11YdF4AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'J11YdF4AAAAJ'}]",622,49029621,Enrico Gandolfi,31548019,Mariacristina Sciannamblo,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

Alt-right Faction, Populist Normalization, and the Cultural War on Fashion from the Far Right","Abstract The article shows how far-right politics since the millennium has increasingly made use of fashion to influence populations in Europe and North America. It therefore considers fashion as cultural material upon which collective identifications are built and further motivate political action. Its topical diagnosis on the Zeitgeist of a “new obscurity in style” embraces the political framework of the Frankfurt School in terms of shared positions and conceptions in the historical development of the New Right in Europe and North America that presently reinforce the dogma of the cultural revolution of the right. Accordingly, this critical study dissects the rise and the rhetoric of far-right fashion brands, the weaponization of AI fashion technology, as well as the infiltration by extreme-right networks of (digital) media discourses and contemporary theories on culture and fashion. From the alt-right faction to deliberately produced confusion, to downplaying the harms and normalization of a racist, white-supremacist, anti-immigration, nation-first militarist agenda, to the role of the fashion designer as a far-right activist, to the implementation of fashion profiling technologies in the extent of cyber warfare, the paper reveals the different political strategies underlying the new obscurity in style.

624,Homophobic bullying among adolescents: The role of insecure-dismissing attachment and peer support,"Abstract The study aimed to investigate the relationship between attachment style and homophobic bullying in adolescence, focusing on the role of peer support. Participants were 334 adolescents and young-adults (141 boys and 193 girls) aged from 15–20 years (M = 16.50; SD = 0.87). Participants completed the Homophobic Bullying Scale, the Relationship Questionnaire, and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. The results demonstrated that boys manifested a higher level of homophobic bullying than girls and girls reported higher level of peer’s support than boys. Regression analyses displayed that insecure-dismissing attachment positively predicted homophobic bullying in adolescence. However, security and safety among peers are positive predictors of homophobic bullying and communication among peers is a negative predictor. Results also showed a moderator effect of peer support in the relationship between insecure-dismissing attachment and homophobic bullying, such that at higher levels of insecure-dismissing attachment, homophobic bullying tended to be higher when peer support (trust on peers) was low and to be lower when social support from peers was high.

627,Cyberbullying across the Lifespan of Education: Issues and Interventions from School to University,"Research on cyberbullying amongst students has tended to be conducted separately within specific education institutional contexts, schools, further education (FE) and higher education (HE), neglecting a view that takes account of the entire educational lifespan. The present article addresses this gap in the literature, providing a novel take on examining its nature, social environments, legal consequences and potentially helpful interventions. To facilitate this, the article conceptualises cyberbullying in broad terms, recognising that it can take multiple forms of online and digital practice including: spreading rumours, ridiculing and/or demeaning another person, casting aspirations on the grounds of race, disability, gender, religion or sexual orientation; seeking revenge or deliberately embarrassing a person by posting intimate photos or videos about them without their consent; accessing another’s social networking profiles with malicious intent and socially excluding a person from a social network or gaming site. This article demonstrates that harm from cyberbullying is a cause for concern for students at each developmental stage and that there are continuities in its appearance that need to be challenged at each point in the educational lifespan. And inaccurately, by university, the idea that ‘nothing can be done’ still is one of the main concerns for the victims.

629,Diabetic Complications and Insight into Antidiabetic Potentialities of Ethno- Medicinal Plants: A Review.,"BACKGROUND
The naturally inspired treatment options for several disease conditions and human-health related disorders such as diabetes mellitus have gained considerable research interest. In this context, naturally occurring plants and herbs with medicinal functionalities have gained special place than ever before in the current medicinal world.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this review is to extend the current knowledge in the clinical field related to the diabetic complications. A special focus has also been given to the anti-diabetic potentialities of ethnomedicinal plants.


METHOD
Herein, we reviewed and compiled salient information from the authentic bibliographic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, Springer, Bentham Science and other scientific databases. The patents were searched and reviewed from http://www.freepatentsonline.com.


RESULTS
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders associated with the endocrine system that resulted in hyperglycemic conditions. Metabolic disorders can cause many complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and microangiopathy. Traditional botanical therapies have been used around the world to treat diabetes. Among several medications and different medicines, various herbs are known to cure and control diabetes; also have no side effects. History has shown that medicinal plants have long been used for traditional healing around the world to treat diabetes. More than 800 plants around the world are shown by ethnobotanical information as traditional remedies for the treatment of diabetes. Several parts of these plants have been evaluated and appreciated for hypoglycemic activity. Medicinal plants have been found to be more effective than conventional drug compounds with no/fewer side effects and relatively inexpensive. In this review paper, we have reviewed plants with anti-diabetic and related beneficial medicinal effects.


CONCLUSION
This review may be helpful for researchers, diabetic patient and decision makers in the field of ethnobotanical sciences. These efforts may also provide treatment to everyone and focus on the role of traditional novel medicine plants that have anti-diabetic abilities.",Recent Patents on Inflammation & Allergy Drug Discovery,2018.0,0,13,0,False,"This review has reviewed plants with anti-diabetic and related beneficial medicinal effects and may be helpful for researchers, diabetic patient and decision makers in the field of ethnobotanical sciences.",,,,,629,144769163,M.

631,Reconsidering Femme Identity: On Centering Trans* Counterculture and Conceptualizing Trans*Femme Theory,"abstract:""Femme"" as an identity construct and a theoretical frame of reference has historically been conceptualized with trans*femme individuals on the margins, if at all included. This theoretical analysis centers trans*femme identity in the negotiation of a comprehensive conceptualization of femme—proposing an initial framework for trans*femme theory.

In the era of multinational capitalism, the trend towards an apparent postnationalism paradoxically risks leading towards what Lysa Rivera has described as a “Fourth World [which] promotes the ‘multiplication of frontiers and the smashing apart of nations’ and indigenous communities.”Simultaneously, the increase of ethnic transnational conflicts in a globalized world has prompted the pursuit of a utopian postethnic future that seeks social harmony but seems to be spiraling into the erosion of the American ethnic paradigm through the configuration of nonspecific and inconsistent ethnic categories, derived from the “lumping of all indigenous people into one category,” as Linda Alcoff claims.This paper aims at exploring the Chicana/o cultural and ethnic identity in the context of multinational capitalism through its articulation and dissolution in the realm of science fiction, where issues such as postethnicity and its intricate connection with corporate globalization are discussed. The study will focus on the analysis of two novels: Smoking Mirror Blues (2001), by Ernest Hogan, and one instance of what Catherine Ramirez has termed ‘Chicanafuturism,’ Lunar Braceros 2125-2148 (2009), by Rosaura Sanchez and Beatrice Pita.",,2018.0,41,1,0,False,,,,,,634,108481958,E.

635,Identifying Key Predictors of Recidivism among Offenders Attending a Batterer Intervention Program: A Survival Analysis,"espanolLas estrategias para reducir la violencia contra la mujer en las relaciones de pareja pueden dirigirse a diferentes objetivos. Los programas de intervencion para agresores de pareja son uno de los principales acercamientos para su tratamiento. El resultado mas utilizado para la evaluacion de la efectividad de estos programas es la reincidencia. Los esfuerzos para incrementar la efectividad de los programas de intervencion para agresores de pareja en reducir la reincidencia deberian centrarse en las variables predictoras clave de este resultado. El objetivo de este estudio fue identificar los predictores clave de la reincidencia oficial a partir de un amplio conjunto de variables obtenidas a partir de una muestra de hombres participando por mandato judicial en un programa de intervencion para agresores de pareja (N = 393), con un periodo de seguimiento de entre 0 y 69 meses. Con este objetivo, se realizo un analisis de supervivencia utilizando cuatro conjuntos de variables: variables individuales, variables relacionales y contextuales, variables relativas a la violencia y variables relativas al proceso de intervencion. Para incluir simultaneamente todas las variables en el analisis, se estimo un modelo de regresion de Cox utilizando ALASSO (adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). De un conjunto de ochenta y nueve variables, seis fueron seleccionadas como predictores clave: abandono del programa, riesgo de violencia futura contra otras personas, exposicion a violencia familiar, estatus de inmigrante, acumulacion de eventos vitales estresantes e ira rasgo. El area bajo la curva ROC (receiving operator characteristic) fue .808, indicando una buena prediccion del modelo. Los predictores clave de la reincidencia identificados en este estudio deberian ser considerados por los profesionales e investigadores en el ambito de la intervencion con agresores de pareja para mejorar sus estrategias de evaluacion e intervencion. Asimismo, se discuten las implicaciones practicas para futuras investigaciones. EnglishStrategies to reduce intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) can be targeted at different levels. Batterer intervention programs (BIPs) are among the main treatment approaches for IPVAW offenders. The most common outcome used in the evaluation of BIP effectiveness is recidivism. Efforts to increase BIP effectiveness in reducing recidivism should focus on key predictive variables of this outcome. The aim of this study was to identify key predictors of official recidivism from a large set of variables drawn from a sample of IPVAW offenders court-mandated to a community-based BIP (N = 393), with a follow-up period of between 0 and 69 months. To this end, a survival analysis was conducted using four sets of variables: individual-level, relational- and contextual-level, violence-related, and intervention process-related variables. To include all variables in the analysis simultaneously, a Cox regression model was estimated with the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO). From a pool of eighty-nine variables, six were selected as key predictors of recidivism: dropout, risk of future violence against non-partners, family violence exposure, immigrant status, accumulation of stressful life events, and trait anger. The area under the receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve was .808, indicating good prediction of the model. The key predictors of recidivism found in this study should be considered by professionals and researchers in the BIP field to improve their evaluation and intervention strategies.

636,Intersectionality and sex and gender-based analyses as promising approaches in addressing intimate partner violence treatment programs among LGBT couples: A scoping review,"Abstract Although Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is an important health and social issue, less is known about IPV among sexual orientation and gender-minoritized (SOGI) populations such as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) couples. IPV among same-sex (e.g. lesbian, gay, bisexual) and gender-minoritized (e.g. transgender) couples requires a reframing of this issue from a heteronormative and cisnormative lens in order to better understand and effectively address approaches to prevent this kind of abuse and to improve treatment programs. The purpose of this scoping review is to explore why including an intersectional lens in Sex and Gender-Based Analysis is needed to improve effectiveness of IPV treatment programs, analyzing what works and why among SOGI populations impacted by IPV in current IPV programs. Specifically, this scoping review systematically searched three academic databases to identify peer-reviewed publications examining: (a) existing treatment programs for SOGI-minoritized populations who are impacted by IPV, and (b) suggestions for future policies and services for SOGI-minoritized populations. Of the 1172 potential articles, 75 met the inclusion criteria, but none described IPV programs specific to SOGI-populations. The findings of this scoping review reflect the need for developing IPV programs that are informed by evidence-based practice in health and social services for SOGI populations, and will offer new approaches for current BIPs programs to move forward prevention and intervention.",Cogent Social Sciences,2019.0,96,12,0,False,,,,,,636,1412539512,Montse Subirana-Malaret,50646245,J.

This study analyses trans people’s experiences of being in public, semi-public and community spaces using the analytical concept of safety/unsafety in relation to perceived health. The analytic framework draws on the concepts of cisgenderism, orientation, lines and comfort. The material analysed consisted of 18 individual interviews with people with trans experiences, which were analysed using constructivist thematic analysis. The analysis resulted in the identification of three themes: straightening devices creating limited living space, orienting oneself in (cis)gendered spaces and creating safer (?) community spaces for healing. Experiences of unsafety ranged from incidents and fear of different kinds of violence in public and semi-public spaces to the lack of a transpolitically informed agenda in, for example, feminist spaces. Safer spaces helped participants to feel a sense of belonging, to share their experiences and to heal. Experiences of unsafety and discomfort are important as they will help us to understand the health situations of people with trans experiences. It is important to facilitate the creation of safer spaces to improve the health of members of this group.","Culture, Health and Sexuality",2019.0,55,14,2,True,"This study analyses trans people’s experiences of being in public, semi-public and community spaces using the analytical concept of safety/unsafety in relation to perceived health and identifies three themes: straightening devices creating limited living space, orienting oneself in (cis)gendered spaces and creating safer community spaces for healing.",,,,,640,8768394,Ida Linander,4147841,I.

The exclusion of other-gendered masculine voices in turn limits possibilities to destabilize and transform hegemonic masculinity. Additionally, the emergent literature on trans* students presents a dismal outlook for an aggregated population with little if any understanding of how trans* students conceptualize gender.

642,'Til Death Do Us Part : representations of men in the Italian mainstream press coverage of femicide,"Femicide is the ultimate expression of violence against women. It is the ultimate act of male dominance over a woman. Despite the criminal justice systems and governments have acknowledged femicide as a crime, there is little public awareness about the patriarchal roots that diffuse and maintain men´s power. Even though the causes of femicide cannot be separated from the causes of patriarchy, femicide continues to be seen only as a crime. Little action or reflection has been deployed to critically look at the perpetrators of femicide. 
 
This thesis embarks from the standpoint that the representations in the news media play a significant role in affecting the extent to which the perpetrators of femicide are regarded as justifiable for their crime. With the aim of enhancing our understanding of femicide and the mediation of men and masculinities, the present thesis investigates how a selection of perpetrators of femicide was discursively represented in Italy´s three mainstream newspapers during 2018. 
 
By using tools from critical discourse analysis and qualitative coding, this thesis shows how news media to a great extent do not problematize the homicidal actions of the man within the context of a persisting patriarchal system. The perpetrators of femicide are represented in continuous negotiations of their profile: mad men/lucid men, violent men/caring fathers/lovers. The thesis links these representations to ongoing trends where patriarchal and hegemonic masculinity discourses – centered on the male breadwinner figure and the dehumanization and decontextualization of the killer – have affected the news reporting. 
 
The mediatization of masculinity within a femicide context has remained an under-researched topic within the field. The conclusions of this study – that the news media are more interested in gazing at the lurid details of the men’s killing dynamics than critically examining them – suggest that more critical reflection on the crime news as a playground for morality is to prevail.",,2019.0,63,0,0,False,,,,,,642,1395246920,Giulia Masciavé,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

In Latin America, information has significantly increased on the existence of stigma; however, little is known about effective interventions to prevent stigma and promote recovery-oriented practices in PHC. The aim of this study is to understand the existing evidence regarding mental health stigma in PHC with a special focus on the Latin American region. A scoping review of the literature related to mental health stigma in PHC was conducted. Two hundred and seventeen articles were evaluated; 74 met inclusion criteria and 14 additional articles were selected from references of search results. Results were subdivided into five different perspectives: users, family members and significant others, health professionals, contextual factors, and potential effective interventions.

Police culture often fosters these beliefs, and consequently results in the under-policing of LGBT citizens when victimized, but over-policing in places of leisure. This relationship is exacerbated when considering the intersectional effect of gender and sexual orientation, undoubtedly impacting legitimacy perceptions due to perceived (and actual) procedural injustice. Using original data collected at an LGBT festival in Arizona (N = 428), the current study examines the relationship between procedural justice and perceptions of police legitimacy among a historically marginalized population. Implications for theory and policy are discussed, with special attention given to contextualizing the findings within the current legitimacy crisis faced by American law enforcement.",Journal of Homosexuality,2020.0,197,32,4,False,"Examination of the relationship between procedural justice and perceptions of police legitimacy among a historically marginalized population finds that police culture often fosters homophobic attitudes, which results in the under-policing of LGBT citizens when victimized, but over-Policing in places of leisure.",,,,,645,51891245,Lisa M.

Instead, I recommend a theoretical lens that permits us to see girls’ sexual agency as a matter of fact, evident even among those who are compelled by social and material conditions to exercise it through sexual compliance, compromise, and concession.

[Johnston, L. 2007. “Mobilizing Pride/Shame: Lesbians, Tourism and Parades.” Social & Cultural Geography 8 (1): 29–45] argues, ‘Pride parades are visible expressions of collectivities which may homogenize experience and exclude those who do not conform to norms’. Thus, Pride has the potential of being a queer platform, in the way that [Warner, M., ed. 1993. Fear of a Queer Planet: Queer Politics and Social Theory.

650,"Voice through silence algorithmic visibility, ordinary civic voices and bottom-up authoritarianism in the Brazilian crisis","From 2013 to 2018, Brazil was encapsulated in a multisited crisis that unsettled its political order. Unlike other turmoil in the country’s history, this one was strongly influenced by ordinary Brazilians who found a space to express themselves politically on digital platforms. This thesis aims to understand how the datafied government of users’ visibility by Facebook (Brazil’s most popular platform) can be understood to have structured these everyday experiences and, in so doing, to have prompted these individuals to (re)constitute the ways they act and comprehend themselves as citizens. 
 
To investigate these processes of civic becoming, the thesis develops a conceptual framework that uses elements of social practices theory to bridge critical notions of citizenship, recognition, datafication, and visibility. It is proposed that one of Facebook’s primary power techniques is the attempt to direct how the algorithmic visibility regime that supports its business model is imagined by users so as to try to prefigure these users’ actions. 
 
A thematic analysis of interviews with 47 users suggests that the ambiguous knowability of the platform’s machine learning algorithms gives rise to three sociomaterial imaginaries of its algorithmic visibility regime. Combined with assumptions about Brazil’s troubled democracy, these imaginaries (and the imagined others that populate them) are found to generate a paradoxical understanding of how civic worth is granted on Facebook, according to which being heard often depends on silencing others and oneself – a phenomenon theorised as bottom-up authoritarianism.",,2019.0,0,1,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'lse.ac.uk', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/4042/1/Magalh%C3%A3es__Voice-through-silence.pdf'}]",JCV Magalhães - 2019 - etheses.lse.ac.uk,,650,32552576,João C.

Establishment of the gastrointestinal microbiota during infancy affects immune system development and oral tolerance induction. Perturbations in the microbiome during this period can contribute to development of immune-mediated diseases. We monitored microbiota maturation and associations with subsequent development of allergies in infants and children.


METHODS
We collected 1453 stool samples, at 5, 13, 21 and 31 weeks post-partum (infants), and once at school-age (6-11 years), from 440 children (49.3% girls, 24.8% born by caesarean section; all children except for 6 were breastfed for varying durations; median 40 weeks; interquartile range, 30-53 weeks). Microbiota were analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Children were followed through 3 years of age for development of atopic dermatitis; data on allergic sensitization and asthma were collected when children were school age.


RESULTS
Diversity of fecal microbiota, assessed by Shannon index, did not differ significantly among children from 5 through 13 weeks after birth, but thereafter gradually increased to 21 and 31 weeks. Most bacteria within the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla were already present at 5 weeks after birth, whereas many bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum were acquired at later times in infancy. At school age, many new Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes bacterial taxa emerged. The largest increase in microbial diversity occurred after 31 weeks. Vaginal, compared with cesarean section delivery, was most strongly associated with an enrichment of Bacteroides species at 5 weeks through 31 weeks. From 13 weeks onwards, diet became most important determinant of microbiota composition-cessation of breastfeeding, rather than solid food introduction, was associated with changes. For example, Bifidobacteria, staphylococci, and streptococci significantly decreased upon cessation of breastfeeding, whereas bacteria within the Lachnospiraceae family (Pseudobutyrivibrio, Lachnobacterium, Roseburia, and Blautia) increased. When we adjusted for confounding factors, we found fecal microbiota composition to be associated with development of atopic dermatitis, allergic sensitization, and asthma. Members of the Lachnospiraceae family, as well as the genera Faecalibacterium and Dialister, were associated with a reduced risk of atopy.

659,How non-binary gender definitions confound (already complex) thinking about gender and public policy,"ABSTRACT A course on gender and public policy can introduce students to methods of policy analysis in the context of social-justice problems. Using a combination of empirical studies and analytic tools, students learn how social conditions and policies differentially affect women and men, and they can identify implications for gender equity. But our world includes non-binary gender types—transgender, genderqueer, and intersex people (some of whom are our students). How can an analysis built on strictly binary comparisons be reconfigured to include more gender diversity? The answers depend in part on how gender is conceptualized (is it a fixed, measurable dimension of identity or something socially constructed?). Exploring three conceptual approaches to gender, this article identifies three more inclusive teaching and research strategies: the expansion of gender types in quantitative analysis, the consideration of non-binary gender social roles, and the interrogation of binary inequalities assumed to be natural and inevitable.",Journal of Public Affairs Education,2019.0,49,9,1,False,,,,"C Chetkovich - Journal of Public Affairs Education, 2019 - Taylor & Francis",,659,14536558,C.

661,"An Analysis of National Football League Fandom and Its Promotion of Conservative Cultural Ideals About Race, Religion, and Gender","Marilyn Motz, Ph.D, Advisor In this thesis I address three specific questions that relate to the current state of NFL fandom. To what extent do religion, race, and gender influence various aspects of NFL fandom? How do these issues reflect the dominant culture and major demographics of NFL fans (white and male)? Finally, what implications do my findings have for sports culture, fandom, and popular culture as a whole? To answer these questions, I provide three different case studies of NFL fan activities such as fantasy football, issues of gender, and religious and social ideals which show how NFL fandom reflects a very conservative view of race, gender, and religion that in particular mirrors and supports the conservative backlash that has occurred since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009. For this thesis I examined NFL fan behavior and fan rhetoric on websites and blogs devoted to NFL fandom. In Chapter One, I focus on fantasy football, a popular activity among NFL fans. I examine the practices of fantasy football participants and how NFL players, particularly non-white players, are commodified by fans that play fantasy football. In Chapter Two, I analyze how women are portrayed by and situated within NFL fandom. I demonstrate that even while the NFL as an organization is trying to cater to female fans (through merchandising and branding), NFL fandom as a whole remains very much a male-dominated community that promotes traditional gender roles and behavior. In the third chapter, I explore how the Tebowmania phenomenon reflects conservative views of religion and race among NFL fans.",,2012.0,114,0,0,False,,,,,,661,2072630005,Mackenzie Anne Ryan,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,
662,Women and leadership: advancing gender equity policies in sport leadership through sport governance,"ABSTRACT This paper uses a multilevel framework to deconstruct the role board members play in advancing gender equity policies in leadership positions in sport governance. Data were collected using in-depth interviews with Triathlon board members of the International Federation and two National Federations. The results show that within the multilevel framework, at the individual (micro) level, male equity champions pave the way for both challenging existing stereotypes at an organisational level (meso) within the boards, and at the sport level (macro) through the introduction and implementation of strategies and policies in the organisations studied, and constitutional changes that encourage women to engage in leadership roles. These strategies and policies display the power of equity champions of change and their willingness and ability to create a gender equitable governance culture. Equity champions of change enable women to feel valued in leadership roles, and further encourage and promote the acceptance of women in the governance of sport organisations.",International Journal of Sport Policy and Politics,2019.0,90,22,0,True,,,,,,662,118876847,Popi Sotiriadou,1657332298,Donna de Haan,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

665,Protecting Children Online? Cyberbullying Policies of Social Media Companies,"A critical examination of efforts by social media companies?including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram?to rein in cyberbullying by young users.High-profile cyberbullying cases often trigger exaggerated public concern about children's use of social media. Large companies like Facebook respond by pointing to their existing anti-bullying mechanisms or coordinate with nongovernmental organizations to organize anti-cyberbullying efforts. Do these attempts at self-regulation work? In this book, Tijana Milosevic examines the effectiveness of efforts by social media companies?including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram?to rein in cyberbullying by young users. Milosevic analyzes the anti-bullying policies of fourteen major social media companies, as recorded in companies' corporate documents, draws on interviews with company representatives and e-safety experts, and details the roles of nongovernmental organizations examining their ability to provide critical independent advice. She draws attention to lack of transparency in how companies handle bullying cases, emphasizing the need for a continuous independent evaluation of effectiveness of companies' mechanisms, especially from children's perspective. Milosevic argues that cyberbullying should be viewed in the context of children's rights and as part of the larger social problem of the culture of humiliation.Milosevic looks into five digital bullying cases related to suicides, examining the pressures on the social media companies involved, the nature of the public discussion, and subsequent government regulation that did not necessarily address the problem in a way that benefits children. She emphasizes the need not only for protection but also for participation and empowerment?for finding a way to protect the vulnerable while ensuring the child's right to participate in digital spaces.",CrimRxiv,2018.0,223,26,2,False,,,,,,665,3472006,Tijana Milosevic,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

667,Changing perceptions about feminists and (still not) claiming a feminist identity,"ABSTRACT We examine student perceptions about feminists and feminism, and the willingness to claim a feminist identity and engage in collective activism, as stated at the beginning and end of a Women’s Studies course. Course participation simultaneously fostered more positive views towards feminists and feminism and entrenched the unwillingness to claim a feminist identity and engage in activism. These contradictory outcomes stemmed from the critical capacity to recognise that structural inequality is reproduced through disciplinary relationships. Thus, unwillingness was entangled with feelings of fear and vulnerability in relation to the national context whereby neoliberalism guides the governance of the self, and where gender equality has presumed to be achieved. The article highlights that developing the willingness to identify and act is intimately shaped and constrained by the socio-political context and personal relationships. We consider the implications of this insight in relation to pedagogical assumptions about developing feminist knowledge in the classroom.",,2018.0,37,7,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'waikato.ac.nz', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/13133/Suzette%20Dyer%20Changing%20perceptions%20about%20feminists%20and%20(still%20not)%20claiming%20a%20feminist%20identity.pdf?sequence=11'}]","S Dyer, F Hurd - Gender and education, 2018 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'S Dyer', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5yM7bHUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=5yM7bHUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '5yM7bHUAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'F Hurd', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DaNWkYcAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=DaNWkYcAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'DaNWkYcAAAAJ'}]",667,46861619,S.

668,How much shall we bet? Defining surreal futures,"This work comprises a critical thesis ‘How Much Shall We Bet? Defining Surreal Futures’, assessing the scope for stronger cross-pollination between poetry and futures studies and examining a potential hybrid poet-futurist praxis; and a portfolio of futures poetry in a range of lyrical and conceptual modes, The Bunny Assembly. 
 
Presented prior to the critical thesis, a fragmentary essay ‘Weak Signals’ introduces the main themes of this research through an account of my experiences attending the 2016 annual meeting of the World Futures Society. 
 
Chapter 1 describes the origins and rationale for the research, key lines of enquiry and underpinning conceptual frameworks adopted, including a discussion of why the topic was explored using the methodology of creative Practice-as-Research. 
 
Chapter 2 gives an overview of the academic discipline of futures studies and assesses how contemporary futures studies balances analytic and imaginative techniques to identify possible, probable and preferable futures, in order to identify any existing links to poetic techniques. 
 
Chapter 3 demonstrates how, although the roles of poet and prophet are historically linked, much contemporary poetry has had unexpectedly little to say on the topic of the future. It is shown through a quantitative review of sample texts that where recent poetry has addressed the topic of the future, it has more often presented cliched declinist or dystopian visions 
 
Sixteen distinct strategies for developing poetic futures are identified in Chapter 4 by combining the steps of a typical forecasting methodology used in futures studies with a simple classification of lyrical and conceptual poetic approaches. These strategies are then evaluated to identify the extent to which they are useful in generating novel and provocative insight about the future. This chapter concludes with discussions of three features which proved effective in writing about the future: ethnographic writing, humour and aphorism. 
 
Chapter 5 consolidates poetic and futurist activities into a proposed praxis for the poet-futurist: what one should do differently as a poet if one is a futurist, and vice versa. This praxis is reviewed in the context of competing visions of the future of poetry. To conclude, the thesis assesses the value of systematic poetic investigation of the future with a particular emphasis on the role of poetry in challenging cliched declinist or dystopian forecasts and inspiring action to realise more hopeful futures.",,2019.0,0,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'bham.ac.uk', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/9024/7/Mcghee2019PhD.pdf'}]",J McGhee - 2019 - etheses.bham.ac.uk,,668,144851576,J.

669,Into the Wilds: Influences from Video Games on Our Perception of 'Nature',"In this paper I examine how representations of human-sparse natural environments, e.g. wilderness, influence what expectations we have when we actually engage with comparable physical places. I use Don Ihde's phenomenology of technology to describe my own experiences playing three games that take place among large photorealistic human-sparse natural environments: Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Horizon Zero Dawn, and theHunter: Call of the Wild. I also conduct a brief literature review on the effects of video games as interactive media on players. I argue that players are capable of applying their expectations of what constitutes realism from digital to physical environments, and that some of these translocations (transferring the perceptual framework from one space to another) limit our ability to meaningfully engage with the world. Although some video games may condition players to hyperreal expectations that leave them disappointed with physical spaces, some games might also produce increased interest and care for human-sparse spaces. The causal relationship between playing video games, changing expectations, and offline behavior therefore merits further study. I conclude with the claim that our experiences with unmediated physical nature should ground our perceptual baselines, rather than evaluating the physical by the standards of the digital.",,2018.0,7,0,0,False,,,,,,669,116552180,Toryn W P Rogers,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,Review
670,娛樂世界： 1980’-90’台灣電子遊戲的日常經驗,"The 1980s is the Golden Era of “Revolution : Feeling Good About Ourselves,” in which various forms of entertainment excites our visual senses in a variety of ways. Such entertainment strategy overrides our interest in exploring the dialectic, and in turn allows us to look into the metaphysical in virtual reality. Entertainment technology as well as globalization in the 80s shape the everyday culture and landscape of our entertainment experiences, transforming how we experience the world. The electronic games mentioned in this essay refers to the bodily experience derived from vehicles of gaming, visual experiences brought by games with electronic screens/monitors, and large-scaled video games (arcade), home video game consoles, hand held video game devices, and the product from the mutual influence of electronic entertainment and TV/film entertainment industry. The holistic experience stated above is obviously affected by two cultures: Japanese culture and American culture. This double pollination creates an atmosphere different from the overall impression of the Japanese Colonization Era and the American Aid Era. It fuels the ideology of Optimism and Futurism in the advanced entertainment technology and the world wide web, creating an unprecedented World of Electronic Entertainment. This research focuses on the 1980-1990 timeline. Through conducting interviews, organizing historic documents, and incorporating personal experiences and practices as an active participant of the era, it attempts to illustrate the form of an everyday culture and its corresponding social landscape, documenting a disappearing culture and lifestyle that has been taken for granted since its beginning. Aside from documenting the history of electronic games from the 80’s to 90’s, the research also Trace back to the history of gaming devices in theme parks during the Japanese Colonization Era (1930’s), the history of children’s parks created during the Republic of China rule, as well as the experience of “arcade” during the American Aid Era.

Findings revealed that the majority of participants (82%) voted for Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Participants reported that the 2016 election results were stressful and in some cases created interpersonal tension between family, friends, and coworkers. They feared that recent gains like marriage equality and healthcare access would be compromised. Despite these stressors and fears, participants also shared what has allowed them to cope and maintain hope following the election.

673,Cyber dating abuse perpetration: evolving methods of adolescent relationship abuse expression through technology,"The rapid progression of technology and interconnectivity has led to new forms of communication and, thus, a new form of adolescent abusive expression occurring as cyber dating abuse (CDA). With recent notoriety and research conducted on traditional adolescent relationship abuse and cyberbullying as separate public health issues, this study aimed to fill the gaps in existing literature by examining CDA perpetration among an adolescent population. Specifically, this research examined the possibility of reciprocal victimization and perpetration experienced between partners within a relationship. Models and theories found in the literature in relation to CDA perpetration were examined. Also, any differences between older and young age groups in either CDA perpetration, or risk factors for CDA perpetration appearing in the literature, were analyzed. It was hypothesized, based on previous research on traditional dating abuse, that there would be a bidirectional and reciprocal nature of CDA perpetration and victimization between partners within a relationship, that the socioecological model would appear most frequently in current literature examining CDA perpetration, and that CDA perpetration would occur more often among older adolescents as compared to younger adolescents. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO databases were searched resulting in a total of 17 non-duplicate, peer-reviewed cross-sectional and cohort studies analyzing CDA perpetration among adolescents with a mean age of 24-years-old between the years of 2010 and 2018. A modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study validity. Overall prevalences of CDA perpetration varied significantly between studies based on the different definitions, methods, and measurement scales used. CDA victimization and perpetration were found to be highly correlated when examined in most studies, although it was also found that reciprocity of CDA in relationships may occur less than reciprocity of some traditional adolescent relationship abuse forms. While gender differences were examined frequently among descriptive analyses, no single theory was found more than others in the literature investigating or explaining CDA perpetration among adolescents. Lastly, direct comparisons between older and younger age groups in terms of CDA perpetration prevalence, frequency, and risk factors have yet to be established. Results suggest the need for further research on the issue of CDA, as well as a comprehensive and validated measure for better assessment and prevention. Clinically, predicting risk factors and screening methods among the adolescent population will reduce overall prevalence and frequency of this unique and emerging public health issue.",,2018.0,0,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'pitt.edu', 'file_format': 'DOC', 'link': 'http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/34588/1/MonicaHeinrich_MPHEssay_6_2018.doc'}]",M Heinrich - 2018 - d-scholarship.pitt.edu,,673,40895673,M.

675,Learning about sexual minorities in school and at home: How critical pedagogy can challenge heterosexism,"Abstract College students, as a relatively privileged demographic, are in a unique position to reinforce or challenge stereotypes of sexual minorities. While much research has explored the social impact of heterosexism (e.g. hate crimes and bullying), few studies have sought to explore how heterosexuals form antigay attitudes. This study aims to fill that gap by examining how college students learn and make sense of messages about sexual minorities. Qualitative data for this study were derived from interviews with college students at a Midwest University in the United States.

677,"The biographical core of law: privacy, personhood, and the bounds of obligation","Contemporary critical legal studies scholarship pays heed to a perspective of materiality in law that jurisprudence more generally has tended to overlook. In keeping with a broader “nonhuman turn” in the humanities and the social sciences, this growing body of scholarship has been observing the passage of law through nonhuman realms. But how wide – and how indiscriminately – can the legal bond cast the net of its dignity? Is not the dignity of law rather connected with human subjectivity in deep and indissociable ways? This paper seeks to contribute to the debate above by querying the quintessential realm where law and human subjectivity intertwine – i.e. privacy. Questioning into the origin of the force of privacy obligations enables us to see its inherent connection with the origin of the force of law itself, and to draw important conclusions from this connection.","Law, Obligation, Community",2017.0,1,1,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'researchgate.net', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcelo-Thompson/publication/322743538_The_Biographical_Core_of_Law_Privacy_Personhood_and_the_Bounds_of_Obligation/links/5a6c91c60f7e9bd4ca6b6c4e/The-Biographical-Core-of-Law-Privacy-Personhood-and-the-Bounds-of-Obligation.pdf'}]","M Thompson - Law, Obligation, Community, 2018 - taylorfrancis.com",,677,2118556189,M.

678,"The Role of Globalization and Integration in Interdisciplinary Research, Culture and Education Development","The goal of this review article is to show the role of globalization and integration in interdisciplinary research, culture and education during the rapid development of human civilization in the 21st century. The process of globalization is largely connected with human development and consists in the universalization of human culture and the creation of a global human community - the only one we know today. As there are different attitudes to globalization in the world, positive, negative and neutral attitudes are considered in the article. Most researchers often distinguish economic, political, sociological and environmental approaches to the problem of globalization. But in the context of our research, it is more important to consider the cultural and educational aspects of the problem. No specific definitions and relationships of globalization and culture are proposed in our review article, but the process of globalization is described in detail. It was not easy to find research works dedicated exclusively to globalization impact on culture and education as most researchers simply conclude that culture and globalization are incompatible. The paper tasks contribute to the field of pedagogy by summarizing some theoretical issues and offering comparative study and analysis of contents and discontents of globalization in different spheres of life, but especially in education and culture exchange. The attitudes to globalization is different, so our main task was to give an unbiased assessment of the phenomenon, to show that there are more to it than just pros and cons. The globalization process and integration as its constituent part can not be turned back in the socio-historical context as much as human development and evolution can not be stopped. If we can show the inevitability of globalization then the advantages of globalization will outweigh its disadvantages.",Journal of History Culture and Art Research,2019.0,35,17,0,True,,,,,,678,2072168808,E.

679,Socioeconomic disparities in life and health expectancy among the household population in Canada.,"BACKGROUND
Life expectancy (LE) and health expectancy have increased throughout much of the world. However, these gains have not been shared equally across all population groups. Socioeconomic disparities exist, though varied methodologies and data sources have made it difficult to ascertain changes over time in Canada.


DATA AND METHODS
The 1996 and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts, with a five-year mortality follow-up, were used to estimate the LE of the household population at ages 25 and 65, according to individual-level education and income. Health status was measured by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 instrument in two national population health surveys and was used to adjust LE to estimate health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). Disparities in LE and HALE, and differences between cohorts, were examined.


RESULTS
LE, HALE and the ratio of HALE to LE were greater at higher levels of education or income. A stepwise gradient was also observed by level of education within and across income quintiles, with people in the lowest combined education and income categories at the greatest disadvantage. Disparities were wider in the 2011 cohort compared with the 1996 cohort, but not necessarily to the same extent for both sexes or at different ages.


DISCUSSION
In Canada, education-related and income-related disparities in life and health expectancy persist and may be wider than they were in the past. This underscores the importance of ongoing data development for routine monitoring of trends in mortality and morbidity, which can, in turn, inform policy development and planning to advance health equity.",Health reports,2020.0,48,18,1,False,"Education-related and income-related disparities in life and health expectancy persist and may be wider than they were in the past in Canada, which underscores the importance of ongoing data development for routine monitoring of trends in mortality and morbidity.",,,,,679,13504854,Tracey Bushnik,4491580,M.

681,How far has parental alienation research progressed toward achieving scientific validity?,"Abstract This article analyzes the evidence for parental alienation (PA) through the lens of construct validity. It defines PA as a theoretical construct. It explains why construct validity is needed to identify PA and reliably differentiate it from other causes of parent rejection. It discusses validity problems in using case examples to support PA and then focuses on empirical research. It makes recommendations for future research. Finally, it proposes a way to present evidence about PA in child custody cases that is responsive to the current state of the evidence regarding construct validity. It concludes that PA is a descriptive concept but is not yet a psychological construct because it has not yet achieved construct validity. The article suggests that the political context for PA has obstructed science. While some PA researchers are overcoming that obstacle theoretically, empirical research and forensic practice in child custody cases have yet to catch up.",Journal of Child Custody,2019.0,82,12,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'tandfonline.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15379418.2019.1614511'}]","M Simring Milchman - Journal of Child Custody, 2019 - Taylor & Francis",,681,1785420317,Madelyn Simring Milchman,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

Due to its very success, those with problems “other than alcohol” are attending AA meetings across the country and are challenging the “deep identification” that takes place within this subculture. Women, as it will be described, have historically had dual addictions and other problems in addition to their primary concern of alcohol dependency. Through the analysis of approximately 300 women’s stories, documenting their experiences with alcohol use disorder and recovery in AA over the past 60 years, it is illustrated that women have not only a history of dual addiction to alcohol and other drugs but that due to gender-role ideology, but also kept their own prescription drug abuse hidden thus not to threaten AA’s singleness of purpose.",,2018.0,73,1,0,False,"This study adopts a gendered perspective when looking at the tension within Alcoholics Anonymous over its singleness of purpose, illustrating that women have not only a history of dual addiction to alcohol and other drugs but that due to gender-role ideology, they kept their own prescription drug abuse hidden thus not to threaten AA’s singularity of purpose.",,,,,682,6254925,J.

685,Ethical implications in teaching and learning about intimate partner violence and femicide prevention,ABSTRACT This article explores a number of ethical implications that could arise in classroom situations when tackling the topic of intimate partner violence and femicide prevention with adolescent students. Due to their disturbing nature these topics might cause distress to students. The elimination of these topics from school curricula aimed at avoiding potential emotional risks also raises a number of ethical issues. These concern the reproduction of silences that shroud the topics of intimate partner violence and femicide in some cultures. The song “Love The Way You Lie” by Eminem and Rihanna is presented as a teaching tool that could be used to navigate the exposure of material that could be ethically sensitive. The song revolves around the theme of intimate partner abuse and could be considered an example of how violence is made acceptable and normalised through cultures that permit and perpetuate it. Insights from a diffractive methodology are employed to suggest that the use of the song for educational purposes is regarded as potentially helpful for students to think diffractively about the lived realities surrounding interpersonal violence and femicide. The article discusses a number of implications this has for educational curricula.,,2019.0,69,2,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'tandfonline.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/20004508.2018.1476001'}, {'title': 'Full View', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:EGONIlk-7SEJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&num=20&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=2018&as_yhi=2019&scillfp=11463716294785291461&oi=lle'}]","J Cassar - Education Inquiry, 2019 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'J Cassar', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GExk6RUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=GExk6RUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'GExk6RUAAAAJ'}]",685,2840314,J.

690,Digital Platforms: The Need to Restrict Surveillance Capitalism (Australian Privacy Foundation Submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) – Digital Platforms Inquiry – Preliminary Report,"On 4 December 2017, the Australian government directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)a to conduct an inquiry into digital platforms. The inquiry, says the ACCC, ‘is looking at the effect that digital search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms have on competition in media and advertising services markets. In particular, the inquiry is looking at the impact of digital platforms on the supply of news and journalistic content and the implications of this for media content creators, advertisers and consumers’. On 10 December 2018 the ACCC released its preliminary report for the inquiry, and called for submissions. The final report by the ACCC is due by 3 June 2019.

This submission by the Australian Privacy Foundation (APF) has been prepared by the above-listed authors with expertise in privacy-related issues, and focuses on the ACCC recommendations that are particularly relevant to privacy issues. The APF gives general support to all of the draft Recommendations made by the ACCC, but makes the following eighteen specific submissions as to how those recommendations should be strengthened: 

(i) We submit that it is essential that the ACCC give full weight to all of the companies that Google and Facebook have acquired, and also to all the streams of personal information to which they have access because of those acquisitions and because of other business arrangements.

(ii) The issues at stake also go beyond questions of correcting market imperfections. We submit that the ACCC should explicitly recognise that they constitute a new and dangerous economic formation, where flows of data have been used to create what is now widely described as ‘surveillance capitalism’, or ‘the surveillance economy’,

(iii) We support strongly Recommendations 1 (additional relevant factors in merger laws, to include the amount and nature of data acquired in a merger), Recommendation 2 (prior notice of acquisitions), and Recommendation 3 (required choices rather than defaults when operating system providers supply browsers, and when browser providers supply search engines).

(iv) We submit that Recommendation 2 is not strong enough, because the history of the platforms shows that any voluntary measures will be evaded and defeated, and that the only realistic approach when dealing with these companies is legal compulsion coupled with penalties severe enough to be deterrents. The ACCC should state that platforms will be legally compelled to give the required notice.

(v) We support Recommendation 8(a), but submit that it should be more specific and should specify (as ACCC suggests) ‘the identity and contact details of the entity collecting data; the types of data collected and the purposes for which each type of data is collected, and whether the data will be disclosed to any third parties and, if so, which third parties and for what purposes’

(vi) We submit that Recommendation 8(a) will not be sufficient to achieve its aims unless the definition of ‘personal information’ in the Privacy Act is amended to clarify that it does include an IP address, a URL, or other information which can be used to identify an individual.

(vii) We further submit that the definition of ‘personal information’ in the Privacy Act ought be amended to clarify that it encompasses data drawn from the profiling or tracking of behaviours or movements such that an individual can be singled out and thus can be subjected to targeting or intervention, even if the individual cannot be identified per se from the data.

(viii) We submit that the certification schemes proposed in Recommendation 8(b) must be developed with considerable care to avoid problems identified in the submission, but do not oppose appropriate certification being used as a means of implementing ‘demonstrable accountability’.

(ix) We support Recommendation 8(c) concerning consent, but submit that it should specifically state that the onus of proof of compliance with all consent conditions lies with the collector of the information; that such separate consents should be required for each separate purpose; and that information for which consent is required should be unbundled from any information for which consent is not required.

(x) We further submit that the ACCC should require companies to rely on ‘consent’ as the legal basis for collecting, using or disclosing any personal information that is not strictly necessary to fulfil the original transaction. 

(xi) We support Recommendation 8(d) to enable the erasure of personal information, but submit that it is far too limited in its scope, being restricted to information provided by the data subject on the grounds of ‘consent’ in the first place. We submit that it should be expanded to encompass an Australian equivalent of the EU’s ‘right to be forgotten’.

(xii) In relation to Recommendation 8(e) concerning increase in the penalties for breach, we submit that if Australian privacy law is to have a deterrent effect on companies of the scale of Google and Facebook, the maximum fines that can be issued should be proportional to the global turnover of the company concerned, and the proportion should be in the range 2-4%.

(xiii) We further submit that ACCC should in addition recommend a statutory damages provision whereby a specified amount of statutory damages may be awarded to all persons whose personal data was disclosed as a result of a data breach due to negligent security (or other reasons in breach of the law), without need for proof of actual damage by the data subject whose personal data was disclosed.

(xiv) We give strong support to Recommendation 8(f) to introduce direct rights of action for individuals to take actions for breach of the Privacy Act before the Courts, without need to first complain to the OAIC.

(xv) While not opposing Recommendation 8(g) to expand resourcing for the OAIC, we submit this is not the most significant cause of the lack of interpretation of the Privacy Act by courts or tribunals. We submit that the ACCC should recommend the removal of the s41(1)(a) and s41(2)(a) Privacy Act impediment to s52 determinations, by amendment to the sub-section to provide that, if a complainant objects to the Commissioner’s dismissal of a complaint under these sub-sections, the Commissioner will then make a formal determination under s52. This will give complainants (and respondents) the opportunity to appeal to the AAT.

(xvi) We support Recommendation 9, and in particular the involvement of the ACCC in the development of such a Code of Practice.

(xvii) We endorse strongly Recommendation 10 that there should be a statutory cause of action for serious invasions of privacy. The ALRC’s examination of this issue was very thorough and its recommendations well-balanced, but we further submit that the ACCC may also wish to examine both the APF submission to the ALRC and the NSW Parliamentary Committee report on this topic, and to consider strengthening its recommendation accordingly.

(xviii) The ACCC preliminary report identifies 9 areas which require further analysis and assessment, and we submit that two of those areas are particularly relevant to privacy protection and do require such further consideration: deletion of user data and opt-in targeted advertising.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2019.0,0,21,0,False,"This submission by the Australian Privacy Foundation has been prepared by the above-listed authors with expertise in privacy-related issues, and focuses on the ACCC recommendations that are particularly relevant to privacy issues.",,,,,690,1906800,G.

691,"‘It’s what Emmeline Pankhurst would have wanted’: Celebrity Big Brother: Year of the Woman (2018, UK) and negotiations of popular feminism(s)","ABSTRACT Feminist scholarship has invested attention in popular culture as a terrain upon which understandings of feminism are circulated, contested and explored. This is particularly so in the contemporary moment in which feminism appears to have achieved a new ascendency. But whilst popular culture and feminism are recognised as inextricably enmeshed, there remains the implicit or explicit assumption in feminist scholarship that popular media culture could do ‘better’, and that there is a more ‘authentic’ form of feminism waiting to find representation. In response to this context, this article undertakes an analysis of Twitter responses to Celebrity Big Brother: Year of the Woman (2018) in order to explore the ways in which a popular media text provides an arena for the negotiation of popular feminism. Rather than positioning reality TV and celebrity culture as a site of ‘ideological ruin’ for feminism, this article explores how CBB is discussed in relation to feminism as popular television, and the ways in which this may offer affordances and limitations.

Results indicated that religiously affiliated institutions and two-year institutions tend to lag behind in their inclusivity of trans students. Gender-inclusive restrooms, nondiscrimination policies that are inclusive of gender identity, and the ability to change one’s name on campus records without legal name change were among the supports that students valued most. Students articulated many concrete suggestions for institutions seeking to be more inclusive of their trans students. The known presence of trans-inclusive policies/supports was related to a greater sense of belonging and more positive perceptions of campus climate.

694,“You start by changing the whole cultural context”: aikido v. gender violence,"ABSTRACT Aikido is a martial art that focuses on non-violent approaches to conflict. The current article discusses ways that experienced practitioners of aikido adjust the social environments in which they practice this leisure pastime in order to pre-emptively address gender violence. Their approaches compliment the tactics of bystander intervention and community accountability strategies.

695,Empowering Uncertainty Resolution for Marginalized Populations through Social Technologies,"We all experience uncertainty every day. What will the weather be like? Will I be able to do well on that test today? Will my sister call me back this evening? Sometimes the uncertainty we experience can be overwhelming and the stakes can be very high. Will my paycheck arrive on time to pay my rent? What was the result from the medical scan I had yesterday? For people from marginalized groups, the stakes of even those ‘everyday’ types of uncertainty can become overwhelming and provide unique and difficult threats. Did the teacher not call on me because I’m a woman, a person of color, both, or neither? Is this police officer pulling me over because of my race, and what can I do right now to keep myself safe? ​In my research, I study how marginalization amplifies the impact of uncertainty and how technology can intervene to empower people in labeling, navigating, and reducing uncertainty. In some situations, uncertainty can be used to create enticing motivation to learn more and gain competence. For example, puzzles present uncertainty that can be fun and in fact encourage learning. However, in other situations, overwhelming uncertainty can be stressful and cause undue burdens to cognitive load and disengagement. For example, acts of discrimination in the workplace can create uncertainty about a person’s standing and ability to perform well at their job. In this thesis I seek to study and design tools to empower uncertainty reduction for people from vulnerable groups. First, I explore how to increase comfort with uncertainty through transformational game design when uncertainty may be expected and even necessary in STEM contexts for adolescents from underrepresented groups. Next, I explore a context where little is known about how marginalization and uncertainty interact examining social support-seeking behaviors and preferences for adults who have experienced interpersonal racism through interviews. Finally, I conduct participatory design work with targets of racism to design for more empowered futures in coping with the uncertainty that stems from experiencing racism.",,2021.0,147,1,0,False,,,,,,695,1726011380,Alexandra To,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,
696,"Humility, ruptures, and rupture repair in clinical supervision: a simple conceptual clarification and extension","ABSTRACT We contend that supervisor humility, a critical variable for effective supervisory practice, has a particular impact on the rupture repair process and its implementation; it may well be preeminent in determining whether any supervisor repair effort meets with success or failure. Building on our earlier supervisor humility/rupture repair proposals, we further propose a simple humility/repair clarification and extension grounded in the idea that, though requisite and foundational, humility in and of itself is not enough. We subsequently give focus to what we label as the humility/rupture context, which involves four components: (a) the activating (rupture) event, (b) the type of humility needed for rupture repair, (c) the form of needed corresponding comfort, and (d) the corresponding opportunity that accordingly gets either addressed or missed. Just as humility can be categorized as relational, cultural, or intellectual, we believe that supervision ruptures in turn often tend to be relational, cultural, or intellectual in nature. We examine how that is so in what follows, providing case examples to that effect and offering a more specific, potentially researchable view about some seemingly crucial variables that increasingly render the likelihood of successful supervision rupture repair far more likely.",Clinical Supervisor,2019.0,64,11,0,False,,,,,,696,82216892,C.

Social work pedagogy, however, fails to identify such experiences as socially-engineered trauma (SET). Lacking an explicitly anti-oppressive pedagogy, social workers attend to micro-level traumas while ignoring the macro forces leading to trauma exposure among certain populations. The term socioeducation is introduced as a method for discussing macro social systems with clients to support trauma recovery, with the goal of catalyzing client and worker participation in social justice movements seeking to disrupt oppressive systems.",Smith College studies in social work,2019.0,125,7,0,False,,,,,,700,51360998,Wendy E Shaia,1579424504,David O.

702,‘From the closet into the Knesset’: Zionist sexual politics and the formation of settler subjectivity,"ABSTRACT This article examines Zionist sexual politics as a particular modality of settler colonial subject making. It analyses the inclusion of Israeli LGBTs into the state, by examining the cultural archive of Zionism, in which the colonisation of Palestine and Palestinians is constitutively inscribed and obscured. Tracing the itinerary of Israel’s LGBT movement, it looks at how the Zionist project becomes articulated on novel terms. Focusing on the specific formation of an Israeli gay identity in tandem with Israel’s shifting settler colonial discourse and sexual politics, this article suggests that the itinerary of Israel’s LGBT movement forms the condition of possibility for Israel’s pinkwashing campaign to take shape. Following Palestinian anticolonial queer interventions that see pinkwashing as part of the Zionist project, it intervenes in analytical practices that frame pinkwashing as a manifestation that arises from the global conditions of homonationalism. It asks: how does Zionist settler colonialism form the conditions of possibility for an Israeli gay subjectivity and pinkwashing to emerge? In doing so, it complements contemporary conversations on the formation of sexual subjectivities within settler colonial contexts by suggesting that these not only define modern sexual politics, but simultaneously re-shuffle the foundations of the Zionist settler colonial project itself.",,2017.0,83,7,0,False,,,,,,702,116504729,Mikki Stelder,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

A growing trend in using mindfulness-related interventions in health care shows positive signs, but there is a paucity of research on mindfulness for sexual minorities. This qualitative research, through interpretative phenomenological analysis, looks into how Buddhist sexual minorities (from various countries) interpret mindfulness from which their increased self-awareness, self-esteem and self-acceptance become prominent intrinsic resources, resulting in enhanced mental health and quality of life. Such an exploratory study extends the horizon of health care benefits for helping professionals and sexual minorities with alternative views in overcoming external and internalised phobia.",Contemporary Buddhism,2018.0,107,1,0,False,,,,,,704,65859378,F.

710,"Across & Beyond: A Transmediale Reader on Post-Digital Practices, Concepts, and Institutions","nessed in Spec Ops: The Line (2012), both of which also provide critique of the videogames medium, be it genre tropes or the very complicity of player interaction. Wade, however, is not wrong in calling for more satire, as the videogames medium can do more, but it is the less-overt games that are doing so in more interesting ways that potentially will provide a longer-lasting commentary. Throughout the book, Wade sporadically mentions the appalling abuses that took place in the U.K. during the 1980s (and date back further) that have been recently examined, with many either prosecuted or under investigation. While these events should not be ignored, their presence in this book always seemed out of place; the connection to the videogames of the time and into today never became clear. The connection between politics and serious real-world events is certainly warranted, which Wade succeeds with briefly elsewhere in the book. But aside from helping to portray the 1980s as one example of a poor time in recent British history and questioning how “individuals could avert their gazes” from these events, it fails to address how this can be understood today. If there is a conceptual criticism to be acknowledged with this book, it would be this. Whether this was intended to play a bigger role in the book is not clear, but if it were, then that could explain its repeated mentions throughout. Through Playback: A Genealogy of 1980s British Videogames, Alex Wade attempts to show that there can be a genealogical approach to videogames, one that does not have to specify a time and place as its position, instead, as part of a “continuum between past, present, and future.” Ironically, at times, the book forgets that the focus is seemingly on 1980s U.K. videogames, as significant attention is given to videogames from outside the U.K. and from different decades. Yet this does strengthen the book, as the examples are given the space to support the argument at that given time, instead of being cut short due to their geographical and chronological otherness. The key to this book is supporting a genealogy of videogames as a whole, with Britain’s role in videogames providing a backbone to rein in the narrative journey. Videogames are not exclusive to a single country, hemisphere or epoch. Wade might have set out to provide a greater insight into the relevance of British videogames but has instead succeeded at calling for a spatially diverse investigation of videogames, and that time is now.","Leonardo: Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology",2018.0,1,1,0,False,,,,,,710,66589220,Gabriela Galati,,,,,,,,,,,"Sociology, Art",

713,"Selective incivility, trust and general well-being: a study of women at workplace","The purpose of this paper is to study if trust on team members and leaders leads to an experience of civil behavior in the workplace or reduced incivility at the workplace. The study was conducted on women employees and therefore termed as selective incivility.,In the study, the relationship between team trust and leader trust was the antecedent variables and general well-being was the consequent variable. Civil behavior in the workplace was the mediating variable. The research was conducted on 228 working women in different sectors of the Indian organization. Trust (in leaders and on teams) and general well-being were measured by established scales. Selective incivility scale was developed based on the qualitative inputs from working women. Data were analysed on SPSS and AMOS version 20.,The study showed that trust (between leader and subordinates and among team members) led to an experience of civil behavior at workplace, and experience of civil behavior led to an experience of general well-being.,This research has contributed to both theoretical and managerial aspects. On the theoretical front, this research has emphasized the role of trust in building a civil environment in the workplace. On the managerial front, it has contributed to showing how low incivility encourages inclusivity and maintains the general well-being of employees, and therefore advocates the practice of civil behavior.,The study is relevant in managing politics at workplace. With an environment of trust, the insecurity and doubt in the minds of employees are reduced. This leads to higher well-being of employees. In the modern times, workplaces are becoming more diverse. There are not only gender differences but also differences in age, sexual orientation and persons with disabilities. Presence of low incivility can go a long way in encouraging an inclusive workplace. It is thus relevant in managing workplace diversity and for creating a more inclusive environment.,Diverse workplace constituting women and minority race have experienced more workplace incivility (Cameron and Webster, 2011). Also, presence of higher percentage of men in the workforce composition enhanced incivility toward women (Trudel and Reio, 2011). As the paper indicates that low incivility leads to general well-being, it also tries to point out that overall health of organization also improves. It should not be ignored that it is not only the employee who is exposed to incivility who gets affected but also the other employees who are witness to such situation.,This study investigates the mediating effect of civil behavior at the workplace between trust, both team member and leader, and general well-being.",,2019.0,98,3,0,False,,,,"PS Rawat, SB Bhattacharjee, V Ganesh - Journal of Indian Business …, 2019 - emerald.com","[{'name': 'PS Rawat', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dEcmEX8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=dEcmEX8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'dEcmEX8AAAAJ'}]",713,1753230416,Preeti S.

Pooled mean effects were computed using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis. Mean effect sizes from 100 separate meta-analyses provided evidence that personality relates to theoretically predicted components of sexuality and sexual health. Neuroticism was positively related to sexual dissatisfaction (r+ = .18), negative emotions (r+ = .42), and symptoms of sexual dysfunction (r+ = .16). Extraversion was positively related to sexual activity (r+ = .17) and risky sexual behavior (r+ = .18), and negatively related to symptoms of sexual dysfunction (r+ = −.17). Openness was positively related to homosexual orientation (r+ = .16) and liberal attitudes toward sex (r+ = .19). Agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively related to sexually aggressive behavior (r+ = −.20; r+ = −.14) and sexual infidelity (r+ = −.18; r+ = −.17). Less robust evidence indicated that extraversion related negatively, and neuroticism positively, to child sexual abuse, and that openness related negatively to homophobic attitudes.

We argue that gaps in representation can create a misleading perception of science and the respective topics discussed in these talks. We validate annotations from an image recognition algorithm for identifying speaker ethnicity and gender to compile a data set of 2333 TED talks and 1.2 million YouTube comments. Findings show that more than half of all talks were given by white male speakers. While the share of women increased over time, it is constantly low for non-white speakers. Topic modelling further shows that the share of talks addressing inequalities which affect both groups is low, but increasing over time. However, talks about inequalities and those given by female speakers receive substantially more negative sentiment on YouTube than others.

It explains how companies engaged in “information capitalism,” “data capitalism,” and “surveillance capitalism” derive economic value from authenticity regulation. It also explores how a regulatory focus on authenticity shapes our views about objectionable speech, upends traditional commitments to pseudonymous political expression, and encourages collaboration between the State and private companies.

They return to Barberspan during the day. Activity budgets were calculated for all Spurwinged and all Egyptian Geese, including both moulting and non-moulting birds, at the lake during the day. Both species spend most of the day sleeping on the shore and relatively little time feeding. Both species spend a large proportion of this limited feeding time on open water picking at floating Potamogeton pectinatus.

722,"Factors related to attitudes toward diversity in Australia, Malaysia, and Puerto Rico","ABSTRACT In this study, we tested social identity complexity theory (Roccas & Brewer, 2002) in relation to attitudes toward diversity and the associated variables of patriotism, nationalism, religiosity, aggression, and sense of self (well-being) in a cross-cultural study of 398 Malaysian, 239 Australian, and 201 Puerto Rican students. Puerto Ricans reported the most positive attitudes toward diversity, followed by Australians, and finally Malaysians. For Puerto Ricans, pro-diversity attitudes were predicted by a positive correlation with constructive patriotism and a negative correlation with blind patriotism. For Australians, pro-diversity attitudes were predicted by a positive association with constructive patriotism, a negative association with traditional nationalism, and a negative association with physical aggression. For Malaysians, pro-diversity attitudes were predicted by positive relationships with all of the following variables: constructive patriotism, traditional nationalism, verbal aggression, hostility, and the need to bolster self through idealizing others. These results support social identity complexity theory and partially support associated predictions for Australians, Puerto Ricans, and some of the predictions for Malaysians. The results are explained in terms of local cultural contexts that may not easily be understood by a simple understanding of the variables that were measured.",,2018.0,51,4,1,True,,,"[{'title': 'tandfonline.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10911359.2018.1428137'}]","J Brown, AL Jiménez, D Sabanathan… - Journal Of Human …, 2018 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'J Brown', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5e6pRIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=p5e6pRIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'p5e6pRIAAAAJ'}]",722,26931399,Jac Brown,143840875,A.

723,Looking back into trans persons’ experiences in heteronormative secondary physical education contexts,"ABSTRACT Background: School is one of the primary settings where non-gender conformer children and adolescents emerge as vulnerable groups at high risk of suffering violence and harassment. Within schooling contexts, embodied experiences in physical education (PE) may become particularly problematic for trans students. However, there is little research focusing on trans persons’s experiences in PE. The purpose of this paper is to gather memories and impressions of a group of adult trans persons on their experiences in secondary PE. Theoretical framework: The concept of heteronormativity is used as a theoretical framework to provide insights and understanding to trans persons’s experiences in PE. It is used to characterize inequalities and hierarchies derived from the intersection of the dualistic logic of gender binarism with other social categories and ideologies. Heteronormative discourses also act regulating the way of looking at and over trans persons’ bodies, categorizing some of them as queer or abject. Participants and methodology: Study is based on semi-structured interviews to nine participants (five trans women and four trans men) from 23 to 62 years of age. A thematic analysis was carried out in order to flexibly and directly identify interpretative patterns of meaning within data, as well as to open them to interpretative frameworks. The categories were grouped into four themes best gathering the experiences of participants in PE. Results and discussion: (1) Hindering desired gender: In daily practices, participants felt in ‘the middle’ of activities, spaces and gender groups, experiencing aloofness, isolation and loneliness. Participants complained about the fact that they could not perform gender segregated activities with their desired gender group. PE teachers played an important role in supporting heteronormative system. (2) Preferences, aversions and opportunities: All participants experienced hegemonic forms of gender and sexuality linked to PE programme activities in different ways. For most trans boys, sport-based PE was their favourite subject, while trans girls found it particularly negative and demotivating. Exceptionally, some aesthetic and dance activities were recalled as nearly non-heterosexual practices. (3) Confronting transgression. Situations of stigmatization and bullying in PE were frequent as a result from situations in which gender norms were eventually transgressed. Teachers impeded any attempt of trans persons to overcome heteronormativity in PE lessons. (4) Intimacy struggles: Body intimacy was crucial for participants. Different strategies were used for the search of intimacy. Changing rooms were the most problematic spaces for trans students in educative contexts. The worse trans participants felt about their bodies, the more uneasy they felt in these facilities. Conclusions and final comments: Heteronormative contexts strongly determined trans persons’ experiences in PE. Trans participants, especially those not performing gender conforming practices, were abjectified in PE lessons. This situation generated multiple forms of exclusion and rejection, as well as episodes of harassment. However, some practices counteracted the dominance of the heteronormative system, showing their potential to destabilize this ideology in PE.",,2018.0,74,42,3,False,,,,,,723,1401353299,J.

725,The Prevalence and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence Intrusion in the Workplace,"ABSTRACT This study examines the prevalence and consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the workplace. Surveys were completed by 1,390 employees in 32 different companies representing different organization types. Over half of the women and almost a quarter of the males reported that they had been an IPV victim at some point in their lives with 16% reporting victimization in the previous 12 months. Younger workers and workers who witnessed IPV frequently as a child were more likely to be current IPV victims. Further, 41% of lifetime victims reported significant workplace consequences, such as missed days of work, tardiness, and perpetrator intrusion. Younger workers, a history of IPV physical injury, more frequent IPV events over longer periods of time, and a history of stalking were associated with a greater number of IPV work consequences. The cumulative effects of IPV as well as active victimization contribute to negative workplace consequences. With significant numbers of employees experiencing IPV and reporting workplace consequences, the present research underscores the need for employers to develop a more precise means of understanding cost and response.",,2018.0,52,11,0,False,,,,,,725,4343880,C.

726,"Exploring Profiles of LGBTQ Social Wellbeing in Waterloo Region, Canada","Literature on the wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people has predominantly examined the negative experiences associated with LGBTQ identity; however, a growing body of literature explores the positive wellbeing of LGBTQ people. The present study examines social wellbeing as the connections across six elements identified in previous literature: discrimination, sense of safety, outness, social support, sense of belonging, and community acceptance. Latent profile analyses (LPA), a person-centered approach, was used to explore these elements of social wellbeing with cisgender LGBQ (n = 406) and transgender (n = 110) participants from a sample of LGBTQ individuals who completed an online survey in Waterloo Region, Ontario, Canada. Four distinct social wellbeing profiles were identified for LGBQ participants, and three profiles were identified for the transgender participants, with varying levels of social wellbeing represented. To further contextualize the profiles, identity and demographic covariates and self-esteem of each profile were assessed. This research demonstrates the value of LPA by contextualizing the distinct ways that LGBTQ people experience social wellbeing, providing guidance to develop services and policies to intentionally recognize the various profiles of people with diverse experiences within the Waterloo Region.",,2019.0,117,1,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'wlu.ca', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3303&context=etd'}]",K Hardy - 2019 - scholars.wlu.ca,,726,115578498,Kendra Hardy,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,Review

728,Large Scale Practice and Anagram Solving,"Practice effects have been demonstrated for several types of problem-solving tasks in which sequences of choices occur (2 , 4, 5 ) . In contrast, studies employing series of anagrams as the problem-solving task have been characterized by the lack of a demonstrable practice effect (1 , 3 ) . Several reasons have been suggested ( 1 ) for the lack of a demonstrated practice effect including: that relatively few anagrams have been given to subjects to be solved, that subjects do not typically work to a solution on each anagram, and that the types of anagrams to which subjects are exposed are generally of a limited variety. The present study was designed to investigate anagram solution times among subjects given extended working times on a large number (N = 160) of anagrams varying in solution-word frequency. The anagrams were formed by randomly rearranging the letters of 160 five-letter words chosen at random from the Thorndike-Lorge ( 6 ) list. Of the 160 solution-words, 52 could be expected to occur 4 9 times or less per million words printed in English (low frequency), 53 solution-words could be expected to occur 50 to 99 times per million words (moderate frequency), and 55 words could be expected to occur 100 or more times per million words (high frequency). Five female undergraduate subjects in an introductory psychology course served as subjects. Each subject attended eight daily sessions and at each session was given 20 anagrams to solve ( 6 or 7 from each frequency category). The same 20 anagrams were administered to all subjects in a given session but orders of presentation were randomly determined for each subject. Subjects were given an extended working time of 10 min. on each anagram and were required to work for the full 10 rnin. o r until the solution-word was obtained before being given the next anagram. An analysis of variance for a two-factor design with repeated measures on each factor (7 , pp. 575-576) was performed on median solution times within the three levels of frequency of solution-words (low, moderate, high) and two blocks of sessions (Sessions 1 4 and Sessions 5-8). The results showed that median solution times differed significantly for the three levels of frequency of solution-words ( F = 5.73, d f = 2/8. p < .05) but did nor differ for the two blocks of sessions (P = 5.66, df = 1/4, p > .05). However, the interaction between blocks of sessions and frequency of solution-word was significant ( P = 7.58, d f = 2/8, p < .05) , indicating that the effects of practice differ for the three levels of frequency of solution-word. A Newman-Keuls ( 7 ) a posteriori test showed that the interaction was due to a decrease in median solution times from the first block of sessjons to the second block for the low but not for the moderate or high frequency categorles. These results suggest that large scale practice in solving anagrams has a differential effect for solution-words of low, moderate, and high frequency. Practice in solving anagrams with solution-words of low frequency results in decreased solution times, while practice in solving anagrams with solution-words of high or moderate frequency does not.

731,Predicting emotion from music videos: exploring the relative contribution of visual and auditory information to affective responses,"Although media content is increasingly produced, distributed, and consumed in multiple combinations of modalities, how individual modalities contribute to the perceived emotion of a media item remains poorly understood. In this paper we present MusicVideos (MuVi), a novel dataset for affective multimedia content analysis to study how the auditory and visual modalities contribute to the perceived emotion of media. The data were collected by presenting music videos to participants in three conditions: music, visual, and audiovisual. Participants annotated the music videos for valence and arousal over time, as well as the overall emotion conveyed. We present detailed descriptive statistics for key measures in the dataset and the results of feature importance analyses for each condition. Finally, we propose a novel transfer learning architecture to train Predictive models Augmented with Isolated modality Ratings (PAIR) and demonstrate the potential of isolated modality ratings for enhancing multimodal emotion recognition. Our results suggest that perceptions of arousal are influenced primarily by auditory information, while perceptions of valence are more subjective and can be influenced by both visual and auditory information.

732,Postracism Mythology: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver’s “Heroic” Banishment of Racism From the NBA,"On April 29, 2014, National Basketball Association (NBA) Commissioner Adam Silver delivered a press conference in which he fined the then-owner of the Los Angeles (L.A.) Clippers, Donald Sterling, 2.5 million dollars and banned him for life from any affiliation with the NBA due to racist comments that Sterling made to his then-girlfriend in a recorded phone conversation that was released to the public. This article examines how Silver, through his leadership performance and the global news and sports media reactions to his performance, rhetorically advanced postracism logics and hegemonic masculine ideals through mythological constructions of White masculinity. This rhetorical analysis and critique revealed that Silver’s press conference and the global news and sports media’s response to it obviate the racial and gender structures of NBA administrative positions that favor White masculinity while simultaneously advancing hegemonic ideals that function to marginalized those who do not occupy White masculine positionality.",,2019.0,80,3,2,False,,,,,,732,115644191,Linsay M.

735,Can Short-Term Rental Arrangements Increase Home Values?: A Case for Airbnb and Other Home Sharing Arrangements,"The sharing economy or “new economy” has redefined consumption in the housing context in a manner that impacts traditional notions regarding home values and neighborhood integrity. Housing sharing allows owners to share some of the benefits of property ownership -- namely use and enjoyment -- while shifting some of the burdens of ownership -- particularly, the economic burdens. With the advent of the sharing economy, there is a brewing conflict between this new economy and the realities of economic regulation. Thus, in the housing context, we see this conflict playing out in the tension between growing patterns of home sharing and existing regulations that prohibit such sharing. Many state and local governments, relying on their inherent police powers, regulate short-term housing. In particular, certain land use legislation overtly prohibits occupation by short-term renters. One prominent justification for such prohibitions is the maintenance of property values and neighborhood character.I argue that, despite short-term housing prohibitions and the underlying policies supporting them, such exchanges can actually help to preserve property values by providing income to homeowners that can be used to offset mortgage and maintenance costs -- in other words, by allowing owners to share the burdens of ownership. Thus, rather than frustrating the goals and purposes for which old economy regulations were designed (e.g., the preservation of property values and neighborhood character), housing exchanges may instead aid in achieving these aims. Specifically, if homeowners are able to do so, they are more likely to be able to maintain their homes in the short-term and, in the long-term, to maintain ownership.Policies that curtail short-term rental housing are of a bygone era and are ill-suited to address the modern sharing economy. The number of online platforms designed to link property owners with potential short-term lessees has grown rapidly over the last few years. For instance, Airbnb dot com (“Airbnb”) -- the most well-known of these platforms -- boasts that it has connected over twenty-five million guests with hosted properties in 34,000 cities in 190 countries since its founding in 2008. Sharing and bartering housing resources is not new. Historically, the concept has long existed in the context of lodging purchased on a time- or space-limited basis in inns and boarding houses, rooms for rent, housing cooperatives, and informal arrangements. The catalyst for such sharing has often been the quest for affordability, coupled with housing scarcity. In the contemporary context, we see a home sharing proliferation the catalyst of which is also the scarcity of resources -- both affordable housing itself and the monetary resources with which to maintain home ownership. What is unique to home sharing in the new economy is not the sharing, but rather the way in which such sharing is facilitated by technology and how the use of such technology is causing innovation in sharing to outpace changes in housing regulation.This Article focuses on the question of whether short-term rental arrangements negatively impact neighborhood character and home values. Part I gives an overview of the character of and justifications for municipal short-term leasing restrictions. Part II examines the Airbnb controversy in New York City. Finally, Part III argues that municipalities may actually be doing themselves a disservice when they prohibit these new economy housing exchanges because they may be missing out on an opportunity to reap enhanced economic benefits from permitting such exchanges.",,2015.0,0,35,0,False,,,,,,735,1422344980,Jamila Jefferson-Jones,,,,,,,,,,,"Business, Economics",Review

737,"Domestic violence and communication technology: Survivor experiences of intrusion, surveillance, and identity crime","Domestic violence has significant social and economic costs each year in Australia. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) play an increasingly important role in this abuse. ICT security and privacy are essential to domestic violence victims, but are often compromised. 
Digital technologies play an increasingly important role in everyday life. The ubiquity of these technologies, combined with factors like with GPS tracking, cloud-based storage, and platform integration, present significant challenges to personal security and privacy. This is particularly true for domestic violence survivors. The control and fear that characterise experiences of domestic violence have an expanding technological dimension as perpetrators weave technology into patterns of abuse. ICTs offer domestic violence survivors vital opportunities for communication, help-seeking and support. Domestic violence victims are a uniquely vulnerable population of consumers who face risks including loss of access to and control of their telecommunications accounts, privacy rights, personal security, and physical safety when technology is abused. 
This study extends the emerging research on technology-facilitated coercive control (TFCC) to gather deeply contextualised qualitative evidence from survivors. We conducted interviews with domestic violence survivors in Queensland and New South Wales who had experienced technology-facilitated abuse, supplementing the interviews via focus groups with practitioners who work with domestic violence survivors in rural, regional, and remote areas in Queensland and New South Wales. The data provided by this study comprise a preliminary evidence base to guide future research, policy, and practice in an area of growing concern. 
This study documented Australian domestic violence survivors’ experiences of technology-facilitated abuse; discovered what resources and tactics survivors and practitioners use to deal with technology-facilitated coercive control; and compiled survivor and practitioner recommendations about how to improve responses to this form of abuse. The findings allow us to better understand technology use in the context of domestic violence, the resources currently available, and how to improve responses to this type of abuse.",,2019.0,0,19,5,False,,,"[{'title': 'qut.edu.au', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://eprints.qut.edu.au/131143/1/Domestic%20violence%20and%20communication%20technology%20Survivor%20experience%20of%20intrusion%20surveillance%20and%20identity%20crime.pdf'}]","M Dragiewicz, B Harris, D Woodlock, M Salter… - 2019 - eprints.qut.edu.au","[{'name': 'M Dragiewicz', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kgqx4YgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=kgqx4YgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'kgqx4YgAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'B Harris', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0YTANUkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0YTANUkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '0YTANUkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'D Woodlock', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1qb6mscAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=1qb6mscAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '1qb6mscAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Salter', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OP0yyk8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=OP0yyk8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'OP0yyk8AAAAJ'}]",737,11019079,Molly Dragiewicz,2013730171,Bridget A.

738,Feeling and thought in collective action on social issues: Toward a systems perspective,"Theories of action have tended to view it—and its basis in thought and feeling—as static, discrete, mechanistic, and decontextualized. Moreover, studies of action have tended to be fragmented in academic silos. The consequences of these problems include a lack of cumulative and contex-tualized theory ‐ building, and an inability to recognize emergent, dynamic, and non ‐ linear causality, especially across levels of analysis. We argue that such problems could be partly alleviated with increased engagement with a meta ‐ theoretical perspective that has long been advocated for in psychology—the systems approach. In this view, thought, feeling, motivation, action, and context can be viewed as co ‐ evolving, inextricably linked, systems of systems. We illustrate the need for and benefit of this approach in the domain of collective action on social issues. We conclude that systems perspectives allow more contextualized, generalizable, conceptually rich, and applied directions for research in this domain.",Social & Personality Psychology Compass,2021.0,141,7,0,True,,,,,,738,2052001135,Fouad Bou Zeineddine,6323332,C.

739,The New Malay Woman’s jiwa as a Postcolonial Structure of Feeling,"ABSTRACT Women from newly liberated postcolonial societies have produced fiction and non-fiction work with a critical view on women’s inferior status and discriminatory cultural practices that powerfully resonate with contemporary feminist opinions. However, their views are parallel insofar as an understanding of ‘women’ remains unproblematised. In this article, ‘women’ and ‘feminism’ are unpacked from a domestic cosmopolitan lens, particularly from the perspective of the postcolonial woman’s spirit of openness to the other. The postcolonial subject in question is the New Malay Woman, a cultural construction in the early years of Malaysia’s independence, a female figure formed through her critique of modernity and encounters with transnationalism. But it is through the New Malay Woman’s soul or jiwa, explicated in the essays and semi-autobiographical fiction of Malay women writers in the 1960s, that we find ‘structures of feeling’ overcoming facile parallels and temporal distances between the early postcolonial woman and contemporary feminist wherever she might be. It is hoped that from explicating the ‘structures of feeling’ that the meaning of ‘women’ and ‘emancipation’ as articulated by early postcolonial women writers is better understood.",Journal of Intercultural Studies,2019.0,37,1,0,False,,,,,,739,113363529,A.

745,Professional changes and new challenges in the field of international aid. The case of a professional master on educational inclusion,"The international scenario seems today characterized by an increasingly level of tensions and widespread conflicts, some of which have taken the shape of real humanitarian emergencies, especially the war in Syria, among the worst in the last decades. Global political change and cultural transformations across the world occur at many levels. On the one hand, national borders and social boundaries are increasingly blurred and constantly (re)drawn as result of the civil wars and massive migration flows. To this regard, the increase in the number of asylum-seekers in EU Member States over the past two decades has became deeply connected with the rise of exclusionary forms of ethnocentrism and populism. On the other hand, the terrorist movements and the political instability in both the Middle East and African countries have made more difficult for vulnerable people achieve inclusion and peace. Growing forms of inequality, generated by a globalization process, have often neglected a fragile balance between the local and global processes, especially in the poorest countries, informing the conservative trends of many Western democracies. The global changing scenario have forced the humanitarian and aid organizations to frame new agendas and re-think the traditional approaches in pursuing stability and promoting inclusion around the world. Indeed, there is an urgent need for professional changes in the way the international community face humanitarian crisis and violations of human rights. Engaged with this issue, Italy finds itself in the strategic position to overcome the inadequacy of European responses to the making of development policies as well as solutions facing the growing arrival of refugees and migrants crossing the European borders. To this regard, the new Italian Law 125/2014 can be seen as part of a broader international policy, which resists and contrasts the new populism that animates Europe, supporting inclusive policies. The Italian Agency for Development Cooperation, even if still processing its model, finds a crucial opportunity to build a renewed approach of cooperation where the Italian universities, among the other institutions, can make their contribution in the field of development and humanitarian aid, opening the “Third Mission” to a development-oriented international effort, as the United Nations Agenda 2030 states. The University of Bologna 2016-2018 Strategic Plan has included the international cooperation actions under the Third Mission, placing them within the Goal 17 of Agenda 2030, that is to strengthen “the means of implementation” and renew the global partnership for sustainable development. In order to achieve these goals, the Department of Education Sciences aims both to become increasingly involved in the internationalcooperation projects (such as, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East) and to promote the training activities addressed to the experts engaging with the educational issues.   Within this background, the paper aims to introduce the training experience of a new Professional Master – which was planned thanks to a past successful experience - in order to discuss the new challenges that these professionals have to face in the changing global scenario. If, on the one hand, the educational dimension includes a wider social function, becoming strategic to all the actions aimed at pursuing human development, on the other hand, the interweaving of the above-mentioned processes makes more difficult the negotiation of shared meanings to which the professionals refer to practice in the field. Among the other, we can observe the difficulty to link emergency humanitarian action to a more organic frame of development interventions. In socio-educational sector, in particular, this tension between emergency and development could fall into naive assistentialism , “paternalistic” attitudes, or takes the shape of an explicit or implicit “cultural colonialism” informing the international interventions. Within this frame, the Professional Master ""International Cooperation and educational inclusion: new professional challenges” will address its effort in training new professional profiles engaged with the humanitarian aid and international development fields as well as a wide range of multicultural reception policies (at the local and national level) towards migrants, children of foreign origins, refugees and asylum seekers. For this reason, the Department has decided to link the training experience to a research activities aimed at explore more in depth the skills and methodologies addressed to such specific professional profile. Complementing the Master, the empirical research will aim, firstly, to collect interviews with some privilege witnesses. In particular, people involved will be practitioners, experts, project managers from non-governmental organizations, international organizations multilateral and bilateral agencies, non-profit associations, social cooperatives, local or national agencies committed to contrast socio-educational marginality as well as to the governance of migration and forced migration. Moreover, the research will also be a way to monitor the developing of the Professional Master, showing lights and shadows of this post-graduate experiences. Finally, it will understand if and how the training activities, and their inter-disciplinary background on the topic pf educational inclusion - from pedagogical issues to socio-anthropological knowledges - are in line with the complexity of the contexts where the students shall work in the future. Thanks to the contribution of the main Italian institutional actors, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the AICS, both the research and the Master can be seen as a significant arena  to strengthen the synergy between the practical and the theoretical-political dimension of the international cooperation, providing to the universities a leading role in training new professionals in such field. For this reason, the Department has decided to link the training experience to a research activities aimed at explore more in depth the skills and methodologies addressed to such specific professional profile.

746,Knowledge of Biobehavioral Organization Can Facilitate Better Science: A Review of the BioBehavioral Assessment Program at the California National Primate Research Center,"Simple Summary The BioBehavioral Assessment (BBA) Program was established in 2001 at the California National Primate Research Center to provide quantitative information on rhesus monkeys’ “intrinsic characteristics.” These characteristics such as temperament and stress responsiveness affect many aspects of an animal’s functioning and can be used to better manage the colony, and to select animals that are more homogeneous for research studies. Here, we review the BBA Program and describe how others have used this information in the design of their studies. We also describe results of studies aimed at understanding what experiences, both prenatal (e.g., exposure to stress) and postnatal (such as rearing), contribute to variation in intrinsic characteristics. The use of data such as these to identify subgroups of individuals with a greater risk for health-related outcomes is an animal model equivalent of a new trend in medicine, namely, precision medicine. Use of BBA data can also lead to a reduction in the number of animals needed in experimental studies. Abstract Animals vary on intrinsic characteristics such as temperament and stress responsiveness, and this information can be useful to experimentalists for identifying more homogeneous subsets of animals that show consistency in risk for a particular research outcome. Such information can also be useful for balancing experimental groups, ensuring animals within an experiment have similar characteristics. In this review, we describe the BioBehavioral Assessment Program at the California National Primate Research Center, which, since its inception in 2001, has been providing quantitative information on intrinsic characteristics to scientists for subject selection and balancing, and to colony management staff for management purposes. We describe the program and review studies relating to asthma, autism, behavioral inhibition, etc., where the BBA Program was used to select animals. We also review our work, showing that factors such as rearing, ketamine exposure, and prenatal experience can affect biobehavioral organization in ways that some investigators might want to control for in their studies. Attention to intrinsic characteristics of subject populations is consistent with the growing interest in precision medicine and can lead to a reduction in animal numbers, savings in time and money for investigators, and reduced distress for the animals.",Animals,2021.0,71,5,0,True,"The BBA Program at the California National Primate Research Center is described, which has been providing quantitative information on intrinsic characteristics to scientists for subject selection and balancing, and to colony management staff for management purposes, and how others have used this information in the design of their studies.",,,,,746,3040880,J.

A daytime bimodal activity pattern was seen with increased activity coinciding with feeding times at 1000 and 1600 h. The animals spent an average of 40 ± 10% of their time sleeping, 21 ± 10% resting, 25 ± 11% eating, 13 ± 9% walking, and 1 ± 3% interacting with other giant pandas. Adult females were less active than males or juveniles. During July, giant pandas were less active during the daytime than during other seasons of the year. There was no difference in activity patterns between pregnant and non-pregnant females. Two infants had similar activity patterns to the adults by the time they were 6 months old.

749,Extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in sheep.,"A study of in vivo extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) has been conducted in sheep using a newly developed radioimmunoassay for serum T3 and a protein-binding assay for serum T4. Serial measurement of serum T3 concentration were conducted after administration of 4 mg Na-1-thyroxine iv to four euthyroid sheep. The serum T3 concentrations during these studies increased 3 to 7 times within 15 hours and the T3/T4 concentration ratios peaked between 39 and 48 hours at values of 0.003-O.011. The initial T4 levels exceeded 40 M-g/100 ml so that endogenous TSH secretion presumably was inhibited maximally. And since T3 contamination of the injected T4 did not exceed 0.1%, the data suggest that significant extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 occurs in sheep. This conclusion is further supported by a chronic T4 injection study in a thyroidectomized sheep where endogenous T3 secretion was absent and the serum T3 concentrations averaged 0.78% of the T4 level. In three additional sheep m I -T4 and I-T3 kinetic studies were conducted to measure T4 and T3 turnover. The mean volumes of distribution of T4 and T3 were 9.5 and 20 1, the mean t1/2 values 1.36 days and 5.5 hr, the mean serum concentrations 6.0 M-g/100 ml and 55 ng/100 ml, and mean turnover values 291 and 32 fig/day, respectively. Calculated steady state fractional T4 to T3 conversion in the chronic injection experiment was 0.097 and calculated absolute T4 to T3 conversion 29 Hg/day. Thus about 91% of daily T3 turnover in sheep appears to be derived peripherally from monodeiodination of T4 {Endocrinology 91: 1141, 1972) T T IS NOW well-established that thyroxine ^ is converted to triiodothyronine in peripheral tissues of man (1-4) and rats (5). Previous studies from our laboratories did not provide evidence for an extrathyroidal origin of circulating triiodothyronine (T3) in the sheep (6). However, these data were derived by column chromatographic techniques which involve procedural monodeiodination of thyroxine (T4) to T3 (6,7), such that a relatively large correction for in vitro artifact was necessary. Thus, small concentrations of endogenous labeled T3 derived from administered labeled T4 might not have been detected. Using a sensitive radioimmunoassay for T3 (8,9) we have reinvestigated the problem of T4 to T3 conversion in adult sheep. In addition, T4 and T3 kinetic studies were conducted so that T4 to T3 conversion could be quantified in relation to total thyroid hormone turnover. Received September 29, 1970.

Hartford Foundation, Inc. * Recipient of NIH Career Development Award K04 AM-70 225. Materials and Methods Four healthy adult ewes (Columbia or ColumbiaSuffolk cross) maintained on baled alfalfa were studied. Four mg Na-1-thyroxine (Flint Laboratories lot #V61RS) was injected intravenously and serial blood samples collected over a period of about 96 hours for measurements of serum T3 and T4 concentrations. The T3 contamination of this lot of T4 was assessed as described previously (10) using a specific T3 antiserum kindly supplied by Dr. W. E. Mayberry. One hundred eighty (180) ng of this T4 produced the same displacement of labeled T3 from antibody as did 0.18 ng T3 so that the extent of apparent T3 contamination was 0.1%. Whether this represents T4 cross-reaction or T3 contamination is not known; however T3 contamination could not have exceeded 0.1%. In one additional animal, iv Na-1-thyroxine was administered daily for a 10-day period beginning 48 hours after thyroidectomy. The initial T4 dose was 2 mg; this was followed by a daily 1 mg dose for 10 days. Blood samples were collected before and 48 hours after thyroidectomy, twice daily (before and 6 hr after each T4 injection) on days 5 to 8, and daily thereafter (before each injection) through day 11. Serum T4 and T3 concentrations were measured in all samples. Finally in three additional ewes, T4 and T3 kinetic studies were conducted to measure hormone turnover.

750,"Coyote movements, habitat use, and vulnerability in central Alberta","A 2-year radiotelemetry study revealed no migratory movements of coyotes (Canis latrans) between agricultural and adjacent boreal forest areas in central Alberta. Resident coyotes were predominantly adults and essentially maintained nonoverlapping home ranges averaging 12.1 km2 in size. Nonresident coyotes, predominantly subadults, frequented home ranges of resident coyotes but may have avoided contact with them. Mobility of coyotes increased after mid-late February. Dispersal occurred between late January and late March and between July and November. Coyotes preferred forested over open areas and avoided open areas close to travelled roads during daylight hours. Nonresident coyotes were located closer to agricultural carrion than resident coyotes, suggesting a greater vulnerability to hunters and to coyote control using carrion as bait. However, annual survival rates of resident and nonresident coyotes after 1 January were identical (S, = 0.38). J. WILDL. MANAGE. 49(2):307-313 Todd and Keith (1976) found a positive relationship between coyote densities in mid-late winter and availability of dead livestock on agricultural areas in central Alberta. A seasonal migration of coyotes between forested areas in summer and agricultural areas in winter was hypothesized to explain an apparent coyote population decline on agricultural areas and a concomitant increase on nearby forested areas during late winter. Mobility of coyotes is restricted by deep, soft snow in forested areas (Murie 1940, Ozoga and Harger 1966). In contrast, wind sweeps much of the snow from open fields, and stronger crusts form in open agricultural areas. Greater mobility coupled with an abundance of dead livestock enhance agricultural areas as coyote habitat in winter. This study was conducted to determine if coyotes migrate seasonally to forested areas in summer and to agricultural areas in winter in central Alberta. We also monitored daily movements and spatial relationship of coyotes in an agricultural area to assess their effect on coyote control during winter months. We thank M. G. Hornocker, A. W. Todd, and A. W. Hawley for critical advice. H. T. McVeety provided field assistance. We also thank landowners near Westlock, Alberta, for their cooperation. SPresent address: Alberta Agriculture, J.

Manage. 49(2):1985 STUDY AREAS AND METHODS We radiocollared coyotes on an agricultural area in winter and on a forested area in summer from January 1977 to December 1978. The 332-km2 agricultural study area was centerd in a mixed farming community near Westlock, Alberta. The area was boreal parkland transition forest (Moss 1955) and was described by Wetmore et al. (1970) and Todd and Keith (1976). Ninety-two percent of the area was cultivated or cleared pasture. The remainder was forest dispersed along water courses and in small woodlots and was mostly grazed by cattle. The 100-km2 forested study area was located 30 km northwest of the agricultural area in the boreal-cordilleran transition forest zone (Moss 1955). This forested area was bordered to the north and west by patches of cleared land. Between the two study areas, land use changed progressively from predominantly forested to predominantly agriculture. Coyotes were captured with snares in winter and leg-hold traps in summer and were classified as pups, yearlings, and adults by incisor wear (Gier 1968). Ages estimated by incisor wear were compared with cementum layer counts of sectioned canine teeth from 75 coyotes collected by hunters and trappers on or near the agricultural study area during November-March. Radiolocations of coyotes were obtained on both study areas biweekly in 1977 and on 6 consecutive days every month in 1978 to determine if a migration occurred. Daily movements were assessed by radiolocations during January-March on the agricultural study area. Time of radiolocation was alternated as follows: 2 days from 0800-1600 hours, 2 days from 2400 to 0800 hours, and 2 days from 1600 to 2400 hours. Home-range size was delimited by the minimum convex polygon method (Mohr 1947). The effect of sallies by coyotes (Hibler 1977) was reduced by including only 95% of radiolocations closest to the range center of the coyote (Bowen 1982). We plotted the cumulative total of the area used by coyotes against successive increments of 10 radiolocations to obtain an observation-area curve. An asymptote of the observation-area curve was obtained when the area did not increase by more than 10% over 3 months. Coyotes were classified as residents if an asymptote of their observation-area curve was obtained, or if no dispersal movement occurred over 3 months, and as nonresidents if no asymptote was reached or if dispersal movements occurred. Movements greater than 5 km with no return for over 10 days were termed dispersal movements because the upper 95% confidence limit of the length and duration of 112 sallies calculated from Hibler (1977) was 5 km over 10 days. Mobility was measured as the distance between successive radiolocations a maximum of 48 hours apart. Coyote habitat was classified as forested or open and _ or >0.4 km from travelled roads. This distance was perceived as a maximum distance coyotes could be easily seen by hunters on roads. Mobility and distance to carrion were compared by analysis of variance. Other comparisons were made by nonparametric tests (Siegel 1956). Survival rates were calculated as described by Trent and Rongstad (1974).",,1985.0,11,61,2,False,If coyotes migrate seasonally to forested areas in summer and to agricultural areas in winter in central Alberta is determined to explain an apparent coyote population decline on agricultural areas and a concomitant increase on nearby foresting areas during late winter.,,,,,750,152898263,Laurence D.

751,Disclosing Lesbian and Gay Male Sexual Orientation in Later Life: Attitudes of Younger and Older Generations in Eight Latin American Countries,"ABSTRACT The purpose of this research was to explore attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men disclosing their sexual preferences in eight Latin American countries. The sample consisted of 1,539 participants belonging to three age groups (18–29 years, 60–69 years, and 70 years and over). Their answers to two open-ended questions were content-analyzed, and binary logistic regressions were run on the extreme attitudinal categories. Results showed that although most attitudes were positive, a solid percentage of participants still expressed different kinds of derogatory attitudes. Men (as compared to women) and participants who were more religious and less educated tended to hold more negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Both older samples were more prejudiced than the younger one, and attitudes also varied according to country. There was a general trend showing more positive attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men in those countries where sexual minorities’ rights are better assured, which suggests that measures to protect sexual minorities and to make sexual diversity in older age visible could be advisable.",Journal of Homosexuality,2018.0,96,2,0,False,"There was a general trend showing more positive attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men in those countries where sexual minorities’ rights are better assured, which suggests that measures to protect sexual minorities and to make sexual diversity in older age visible could be advisable.",,,,,751,144349029,Feliciano Villar,3518574,R.

753,Goodbye Tracking? Impact of iOS App Tracking Transparency and Privacy Labels,"Tracking is a highly privacy-invasive data collection practice that has been ubiquitous in mobile apps for many years due to its role in supporting advertising-based revenue models. In response, Apple introduced two significant changes with iOS 14: App Tracking Transparency (ATT), a mandatory opt-in system for enabling tracking on iOS, and Privacy Nutrition Labels, which disclose what kinds of data each app processes. So far, the impact of these changes on individual privacy and control has not been well understood. This paper addresses this gap by analysing two versions of 1,759 iOS apps from the UK App Store: one version from before iOS 14 and one that has been updated to comply with the new rules. We find that Apple’s new policies, as promised, prevent the collection of the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier for cross-app tracking. Smaller data brokers that engage in invasive data practices will now face higher challenges in tracking users – a positive development for privacy. However, the number of tracking libraries has – on average – roughly stayed the same in the studied apps. Many apps still collect device information that can be used to track users at a group level (cohort tracking) or identify individuals probabilistically (fingerprinting). We find real-world evidence of apps computing and agreeing on a fingerprinting-derived identifier through the use of server-side code, thereby violating Apple’s policies. We find that Apple itself engages in some forms of tracking and exempts invasive data practices like first-party tracking and credit scoring from its new tracking rules. We also find that the new Privacy Nutrition Labels are sometimes inaccurate and misleading, especially in less popular apps.

754,"Internalized Heterosexism, Outness, Athletic Identity, and Perceived Stress Among Queer Female Athletes","Internalized Heterosexism, Outness, Athletic Identity, and Perceived Stress Among Queer Female Athletes Olivia Scott The historical presence of heterosexism in sport has been discussed in numerous publications, with unique considerations for female athletes (Anderson, Magrath, & Bullingham, 2016; Cahn, 1993; Griffin, 1998; Rankin, 1998). Unfortunately, few studies have examined the impact of this climate on female athletes with minoritized sexual identities. Most research pertaining to this population has been qualitative and largely focused on lesbian athletes (Fynes & Fisher, 2016; Stoelting, 2011). Consequently, more generalizable conclusions about queer female athlete experiences has been limited. The present study was an attempt to address this research gap, by assessing the internalized heterosexism, outness, athletic identity, and perceived stress of queer women competing at the college level. Two mediation models were proposed. The first situated internalized heterosexism as a mediator of the relationship between athletic identity and perceived stress. The second situated internalized heterosexism as a mediator between outness and perceived stress. Participants were recruited via online webpages and email advertisement. Only cisgender women over 18, competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and identifying with a minoritized sexual identity were eligible to participate. Athletes were administered a demographic questionnaire, the Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale (IHP-R; Herek, Gillis, & Cogan, 2009), the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS; Brewer & Cornelius, 2001), the Nebraska Outness Inventory (NOS; Meidlinger & Hope, 2014), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen & Williamson, 1988). Results indicate support for the first mediation model but not for the second. Additional analyses revealed a regression model in which athletic identity, sexual orientation, and religiosity predicted internalized heterosexism. Findings related to demographics offer insight into athletes who may be at greater risk for negative outcomes. Applications and directions for future research are discussed to aid coaches, mental health professionals, and university administrators in better serving queer female athletes.",,2019.0,208,1,0,True,,,,,,754,32244031,Olivia C Scott,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

756,Meteorological Annual Report for 1997,"An analysis of meteorological data collected at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in 1997 shows that overall weather conditions for the year were relatively cool and wet. The average temperature for 1997 was 63.7 degree F which is about 1 degree F below the annual average for the 30-year period 1968-97. June 1997 had the lowest average temperature of any June in the 34 years for which temperature records are available at SRS ; moreover, the average temperature for the summer months (June, July, and August) was the third lowest for any summer on record. Conversely, the average temperature for March 1997 was the highest for any March in the 34-year record. Temperature extremes for 1997 ranged from a minimum of 18.6 degree F on January 18 to a maximum of 99.1 degree F on August 15.Wet weather during the last three months of the year was due to the development of a strong El Nino event (NOAA, 1998). Total rainfall for December 1997, 10.19 inches, was the highest for a December in the 46 year period of record for precipitation. Monthly rainfall was above average each month except March, May, and August. The greatest 24-hour rainfall during the year was 2.82 inches on December 24. Daily rainfall in excess of 2 inches occurred on April 28, June 28, and September 25. No snow was recorded.The annual average wind speed at the Central Climatology meteorology tower near N Area was 5.8 mph which is very nearly equal to the average wind speed at that station for the 7-year period 1991-97. The 1997 data also showed a slightly higher frequency of west to northwest winds and a slightly lower frequency of northeast winds than was observed in the 5-year period 1992-96. A winter storm which developed over the Mid-Atlantic States March 30-31 produced the most notable period of sustained strong winds. Daily and 15-minute average wind speeds of 15.3 miles per hour (mph) and 25.1 mph, respectively, were recorded at Central Climatology.Monthly average relative humidity for the year was lowest during the spring months (52 percent in April) and highest in the summer and fall (79 percent in October). The average relative humidity for the year was 70 percent and the average daily minimum relative humidity, which typically occurs during the afternoon, was 46 percent.No tropical weather systems affected the SRS region in 1997.

757,Seasonal Variation of Reproduction and Fattening in Gulf Killifish from Brackish Mariculture Ponds,"Seasonal changes in gonadal indices, plasma androgens in males, plasma estrogens and egg production in females, and body fat content in both sexes were monitored in gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, reared in mariculture ponds. Changes in plasma androgens (males) and estrogens (females) were positively correlated with changes in gonadosomatic indices (GSI) of both sexes during most of the year. Seasonal variation in the GSis of a nearby natural marsh population were similar, though not identical, to that of the pond-raised population. However several distinct differences were noted between these two populations: 1) spawning was prolonged in the mariculture population as compared with the wild population; 2) body fat content of the mariculture fish was significantly greater than wild fish during all seasons of the year; 3) a significant negative correlation between the seasonal cycles of body fattening and reproduction was observed in the mariculture fish but not in the wild fish. These data indicate that the mariculture environment and resultant high levels of body fattening supported prolonged spawning in this species. Seasonal cycles of reproduction (de Vlaming, 1974) and fattening (Shul'man, 1974) are characteristic of temperate zone fish. In general, these cycles are inversely related (Nikolskii, 1963; de Vlaming, 1971; Shul'man, 1974) due to the utilization by teleosts of fat reserves as the primary energy source for generative purposes, including reproduction (Shul'man, 1974). Food availability is conside red the ultimate controlling factor for both reproduction (de Vlaming, 1974) and fattening (Shul'man, 1974), with temperature and photoperiod acting as proximate cues for synchronization of these cycles (de Vlaming, 1974). Where food supply is relatively constant, as can be the case in lower latitudes, reproduction (Nikolskii, 1963) and 1Sup ported by NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service under PL 88-309 (Project 2-236-R) and the State of Alabama. 23 fattening (Shul'man, 1974) are less seasonally variable than in temperate zone fish. In a recent survey of seasonal reproduction and lipid content of several subtropical cyprinodontids from the Gulf coast, including the gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, de Vlaming et at. (1978) concluded that these fish differed from fish of higher latitudes in several ways: subtropical cyprinodontids had protracted breeding seasons, limited seasonal variability of fat reserves, and no detectable relationship between reproduction and fattening. An abundant year-round food supply was suggested to be the reason for the lack of a significant negative correlation between reproduction and fattening typically observed in temperate zone fish. The present investigation was conducted on F. grandis reared in brackishwater mariculture ponds. This study, undertaken to investigate the feasibility 1 MacGregor et al.: Seasonal Variation of Reproduction and Fattening in Gulf Killifis Published by The Aquila Digital Community, 1983 24 R. MacGregor Ill, M.S. Greeley, Jr., W.C. Trimble, and W.M. Tatum of raising these fish for the bait industry, provided an opportunity to determine how controlled high food availability throughout the year affects reproduction and fat storage in a southern temperatesubtropical environment. Seasonal variations in gonadal growth, plasma gonadal steroids (androgens and estrogens), egg production and body fat content were measured in this cultured population of F. grandis and compared to reproductive and fattening indices of fish sampled from a local salt marsh. METHODS All ponds used for holding, spawning, hatching and grow-out studies were 0.8ha in mean surface area and 1.0m in mean depth, located at the Claude Peteet Mariculture Center (CPMC) on the southeast side of Mobile Bay, Baldwin County, Alabama. Fish were fed a commercial floating feed (Purina Trout Chow) twice daily (4-5% body weight/day). Chicken manure (284 kg/ha) was occasionally added to promote natural pond productivity. Further details of the pond conditions are described by Tatum et at. (1979). In February 1978, brood fish were stocked from a population reared at CPMC since 1975 into two spawning ponds (500 males & 500 females per pond). Ten male and female brood fish were sacrificed on the following dates: 1) 20 February prior to stocking spawning ponds, 2) 20 March prior to setting spawning mats for egg counts, 3) 16 May when offspring were harvested from spawning and hatching ponds, 4) 18 August during a late summer spawning study, 5) 28 October prior to transfer to holding ponds(overwintering}, and 6) January 1979 prior to restocking spawning ponds. Body lengths and weights were recorded, blood plasma collected and frozen for later analysis and gonads weighed and preserved in buffered 20% formalin; gonadosomatic index (GSI) was calculated as gonad weight as a percent of body weight. After removal of the gonads, the fish were dessicated to a constant weight. Dried carcasses were then weighed, cut into small sections and lipids extracted for 48 hours with petroleum ether; longer extraction periods did not yield significantly greater amounts of lipids. Tissues were washed three times with fresh petroleum ether and the ether extract evaporated at 40° C. Body fat was expressed as a percent of dried body weight. Spawning activity was assessed from estimates of eggs deposited on spawning mats (Tatum et at., 1979). Estimates were made daily from 21 March through 4April by counting eggs in a random number of mesh squares for each mat. Mats with eggs then were transferred by hand to hatching ponds. On 16 May, hatching ponds and brood ponds were drained to collect offspring for distribution to growout ponds. On 31 July, spawning mats were replaced in brood stock ponds to assess late summer spawning. In addition, on 18 August, spawning mats were placed in grow-out ponds to assess spawning activity of young-of-the-year. Egg production was estimated weekly for each pond. For comparative purposes gulf killifish were collected at approximate monthly intervals during the study period from a salt marsh at the Point aux Pins Marsh Lab (PPML: Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium of Alabama), located west of Mobile Bay on the Mississippi Sound, near Bayou La Batre in Mobile County, Alabama. Fish were collected in minnow traps and by seining in shallow (less than 1.0m deep) inlets. Body lengths and weights were recorded, gonads weighed and preserved and fat extracted. Body sizes of sample populations were similar (pond males: 9.92g2 Gulf of Mexico Science, Vol. 6 [1983], No. 1, Art. 3 https://aquila.usm.edu/goms/vol6/iss1/3 DOI: 10.18785/negs.0601.03 63.55g; pond females: 10.61g-54.17g; marsh males; 4.61 g-55.07g; marsh females: 5.15g-60.92g). Spawning activity, egg production and plasma steroids were not determined for the marsh population. Plasma Steroid Assay Androgens (testosterone and 11ketestosterone) in male plasma and estrogens (estradiol and estrone) in female plasma were extracted and quantified by radioimmunoassay as outlined in Dindo and MacGregor (1981 ). Because plasma extracts were not chromatographically purified for testosterone or estradiol-17 ,8, steriod concentrations were expressed as androgens (males) and estrogens (females). This procedure has provided a good indicator of reproductive condition when applied to other teleosts (Dindo and MacGregor, 1981; MacGregor et at., 1981). Accuracy of the assays with Fundulus plasma was determined by measurement of aliquots of different volumes from a sample pool to verify a linear response. Buffer blanks and water blanks repeatedly gave readings equal to or less than 5 pg/100 111. Plasma aliquots reading less than 10 pg/1 00 111 were considered nondetectable. The data were tested for satistical differences by analysis of variance and modified Duncan's New Multiple Range test (Steel and Torrie,",,1983.0,7,12,0,True,"Seasonal changes in gonadal indices, plasma androgens in males, plasma estrogens and egg production in females, and body fat content in both sexes were monitored in gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, reared in mariculture ponds to determine how controlled high food availability throughout the year affects reproduction and fat storage in a southern temperatesubtropical environment.",,,,,757,152365657,R.

765,Women Into Advanced Manufacturing: Can Community College Open this Door?,"OF DISSERTATION WOMEN INTO ADVANCED MANUFACTURING: CAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPEN THIS DOOR? Women still rarely choose to seek employment in advanced manufacturing. Lack of familiarity with manufacturing jobs and education programs, lack of role models, and too few experiential opportunities contribute to women not choosing manufacturing jobs as well as other jobs traditionally held by men (Reha, Lufkin, & Harrison, 2009; St. Rose & Hill, 2013; Starobin & Laanan, 2008). Nontraditional jobs for women often provide higher wages and more opportunity for advancement than traditional jobs for women. This study is a qualitative thematic narrative analysis of factors that influenced women who chose an advanced manufacturing program at a community college to enter employment in a male-dominated career sector. Intersectionality and agency were the overarching concepts used to examine how working-class women navigated the unfamiliar spaces of higher education and manufacturing. Data were collected through interviews that spanned across several years as the women in the study advanced through the community college and into the manufacturing workplace. The primary research questions included: 1) What motivated the women to begin the program and what were their doubts? 2) How did the women’s experiences in the community college and participation in an advanced manufacturing program influence their education and career choices? And, 3) What might be learned through their stories, particularly their perspectives related to identity and agency? Women reported their top reason for initially pursuing education and employment in manufacturing was the potential income and employee benefits; however, as the women progressed, they reported additional benefits that included increased confidence at work and at home. The women cited earning a college credential as the most transformative aspect of their journey and attributed unexpected personal growth and self-discovery to their college experience. Additional findings pertained to the value of the college support program, the challenges of exercising agency in a patriarchal environment, and the advantages of women’s ways of working for both the employee and the employer. The results of this study have financial implications for women, programmatic implications for colleges, workforce development implications for communities, and employee recruitment and retention implications for manufacturers.",,2019.0,76,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'uky.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&context=epe_etds'}]",CB Schutzman - 2019 - uknowledge.uky.edu,,765,1581466514,Carissa Bradley Schutzman,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

770,"Multi-Systemic Biological Risk and its Association with Discrimination, Cancer Mortality, and All-Cause Mortality","Author(s): Acheampong, Teofilia Y. | Advisor(s): Odegaard, Andrew O. | Abstract: A multi-systemic biological risk index (MSBR), a proxy for allostatic load, is a composite index of biomarkers that represents dysregulation due to responses to chronic external stress. Research suggests that long term stressful conditions take a toll on one's health, providing the basis for a model that ties external stressors with bio-physiological responses, which in turn influences incidence and prognosis of disease. This dissertation examined three aims that addressed a few gaps in the literature. For one, no previous study has accounted for major sources of chronic stress such as low social support and multiple dimensions of discrimination, which could potentially confound the allostatic load-mortality association. To address this gap we examined the association of MSBR with all-cause mortality in an African-American cohort. Next, while a few previous studies have linked a biological measure of multi-systemic stress with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, there is no research that has examined an objective biological measure of multi-systemic stress with cancer outcomes. Lastly, we examined if exposure to discrimination, as measured by a comprehensive discrimination instrument, was associated with multi-systemic biological risk. This dissertation provides new evidence for the strong association between an index of MSBR, (a proxy for allostatic load), and cancer mortality in the NHANES III population. This was particularly evident amongst those who were overweight and obese, and the association was mainly driven by the immune and cardiovascular domains. In the Jackson Heart Study, we found that the MSBR index was positively associated with risk for mortality within an African-American cohort, and the association was higher amongst those of a younger age. This was independent of socioeconomic position, lifestyle risk factors and experiences of discrimination. Lastly, in the CARDIA study we found no association between discrimination or changes in discrimination and the MSBR index. This study provided novel data on the topic of discrimination and objectively measured health risk factors, particularly because we were able to examine change in discrimination with MSBR.",,2018.0,0,1,0,False,"This dissertation provides new evidence for the strong association between an index of MSBR, (a proxy for allostatic load), and cancer mortality in the NHANES III population.",,"[{'title': 'escholarship.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://escholarship.org/content/qt6cs2v1rg/qt6cs2v1rg.pdf'}]",TY Acheampong - 2018 - escholarship.org,,770,51112724,Teofilia Acheampong,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,

772,Adding depth to the next generation of physical activity models.,"In the mid-1990s, an explosion of behavioral theory testing in the physical activity domain began and has continued at a strong pace, as researchers attempt to explain why some people are active and others are not. Theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, and the transtheoretical model have comprised the bulk of this research on theory testing (9), yet recent reviews and meta-analyses have not been favorable for their utility in physical activity behavior change efforts (2,7,11). These original theories, applied from social psychology and allied disciplines, also have shown some limitations in terms of scope and missing variables important to physical activity. Thus, recent calls have been made to adapt and create the next generation of models that may better serve physical activity behavior (5,9,11). The Integrated Behavior-Change (IBC) Model for Physical Activity proposed by Hagger and Chatzisarantis (4) takes up this challenge by offering a blend of the theory of planned behavior and self-determination theory under careful consideration of previous limitations of both these theories. Avoiding construct redundancy is a major challenge in theory integration, as many theories use different labels for similar concepts (1). Hagger and Chatzisarantis have performed this task admirably in their IBC Model, as the constructs of the theory of planned behavior have replaced the self-determination theory’s regulation constructs, which are somewhat redundant with the theory of planned behavior and less advanced/distinct in terms of past theory testing. This creates a basis for theory of planned behavior cognitions via the self-determination theory’s need for autonomy while using the depth of the theory of planned behavior’s structure as proximal antecedents of physical activity. The IBC Model, like several other next-generation models (6,8,10,12), also uses a phased structure (motivational, volitional) and considers the role of deliberative and implicit determination of physical activity that has been a shortcoming of the early physical activity theories. There still are some areas where the IBC may be further refined. For example, the model may lack consideration of the affective domain in physical activity behavior over reasoned approaches to motivation (3). The self-determination theory’s intrinsic regulation construct, omitted from their model, comprised this affective domain better than the general attitude construct within the theory of planned behavior. Furthermore, the role of social-ecological context goes unmentioned, and the implicit constructs within the IBC Model have a relatively underdeveloped antecedent structure in comparison with the deliberative constructs. Still, Hagger and Chatzisarantis are open to modification of the model if researchers can establish an overlooked explanatory process or mechanism. This suggests that the IBC Model can be viewed as a master template, which is very helpful to ongoing theory testing. Overall, the model has had successful tests to support its structure via mediation of autonomy to behavior using passive designs.

774,"A Two-Paper Mixed Method Pilot Study on Perceived Social Support, Self Esteem, and Racial-Ethnic Microaggressions among Undergraduate, Graduate, and Professional College Students in the United States","The retention, success, and well-being of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the United States is a critical issue in the field of higher education. Colleges and Universities across the United States often reflect intractable conflicts and dynamics of the larger society. Consequently, institutions of higher education have grappled with the dynamic of systemic and interpersonal racism throughout history. Racial and ethnic microaggressions is a recent dynamic that has been described to impact the well-being of college students of color. Racial microaggressions are perceived intentional or unintentional slights that have been suggested to impact the self-esteem of college students. The following is a two-paper mixed method dissertation pilot study examining the relationship between racialethnic microaggressions, self-esteem, and perceived social support among college students in the United States. The first paper is a literature review examining racial-ethnic microaggressions, self-esteem, and perceived social support. The second paper is a mixed method pilot study among college students examining the relationship amongst the three variables. A sample of (N = 5) semi-structured interviews were conducted for the qualitative section of the second paper and a sample of (N = 81) college students completed a survey which included the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Racial and Ethnic Microagressions Scale. A descriptive and correlational analysis was conducted in the quantitative section of the second paper and a thematic analysis was utilized for the qualitative section. Findings from this pilot study identify a correlation among selective variables, emerging themes, protective factors, and implications for future research.

775,Masculinity and Violence: Early childhood traumas which lead to violent behavior in young boys,"The goal of this study was to explore early childhood traumas young boys experience that may lead to violent behavior. The research questions for this study focused on childhood traumas, specifically child maltreatment, exposure to violence and drugs in the family and community, emotional abandonment from parents, drug use/abuse and residential mobility. This study consisted of open ended interview questions of incarcerated men at Old Colony Correctional Center. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data. Through a coding process, specific themes, concepts and relationships emerged from the data. The results of this study have indicated that experiencing early childhood traumas influences deviant behavior in later adolescence to early adulthood. The findings were also in line with current literature when exploring one specific trauma. However, more research needs to be conducted when analyzing individuals who experience more than one trauma in their life. This data contributes to the growing literature of masculinity and violence in the discipline of criminal justice.

776,The molecular biology of the elites is replaced by an environmentally interactive biology of social equality,"What is life, and ultimately human nature and its biology? The answer to these questions requires a close examination of the scientific validity of the widespread gene-centred notion of human nature’s blind dependence on ‘selfish genes’. This perception has been imposed on biological science and eventually on the public by the economic elites since the 1920s, with the creation of Molecular Biology in order to scientifically justify their economic-political power as inherently (genetically) predetermined. However, new scientific developments in biology have questioned this perception, and redefine human nature as the result of biochemical interactions, feedback and modulation mechanisms between life’s different levels of organization (cells, organs, organism) with the environment, physical and social. DNA is acting as a passive library of stored genetic information provided on demand by the organisms, and man, in response of their adaptive requirements to their intra-/inter-organisms’ environment, and also to the external (physical, social) environment, which life itself modifies in response. The present study expands the scientific arguments of a previous critique of Marx and Marxism on its acceptance of genetic inequality among humans, for the main reason that this unscientific notion and centrepiece of the ideology of the economic elites pervades and the core of the ideology of the communist, left and anarchist fragmentations of Marxism. The new scientific evidence clearly shows that the biology of man necessitates that for his survival as species he should organize socio-political structures comprised of individuals unconditionally recognized as biologically and intellectually equivalent from birth. The new science of Biology is presented here extensively and in layman’s terms with the wish to be considered by scientific study groups formulated in each and every political fragmentation of the left to help converge into a new unifying ideology of unconditional equality among men. Such ideology should be fully depleted from any elements of the gene-centred ideology of the capitalist elites as to be clearly recognized and contrasted by the masses, in order to help them realize that they are viewed by the elites as genetically inferior and degenerate disposables, with the aim to give them a clearer purpose to react against them.",,2019.0,13,2,0,False,"The present study expands the scientific arguments of a previous critique of Marx and Marxism on its acceptance of genetic inequality among humans, for the main reason that this unscientific notion and centrepiece of the ideology of the economic elites pervades and the core of the ideologies of the communist, left and anarchist fragmentations of Marxism.",,"[{'title': 'researchgate.net', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christos-Georgiou-6/publication/330231578_The_molecular_biology_of_the_elites_is_replaced_by_an_environmentally_interactive_biology_of_social_equality/links/5cacc913299bf193bc2c751e/The-molecular-biology-of-the-elites-is-replaced-by-an-environmentally-interactive-biology-of-social-equality.pdf'}]","CD Georgiou - Critique, 2019 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'CD Georgiou', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HUhpF3YAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=HUhpF3YAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'HUhpF3YAAAAJ'}]",776,2072481356,C.

To this end, we draw upon the work of the late educational sociologist Pierre Bourdieu to outline a critical communication pedagogical understanding of institutional socialization at a public, 4-year university. We conducted focus groups with 36 college students to understand their perceptions of (in)appropriate communicative behaviors, norms, and attitudes in higher education. We then discuss the importance of their perceptions of social and cultural capital, connect their ascriptions to the (re)production of existing social relationships, and advocate for a renewed focus on seemingly innocuous communication and instruction concepts and variables in light of our findings.

780,"Suicidal Utopian Delusions in the 21st Century: Philosophy, Human Nature and the Collapse of Civilization Articles and Reviews 2006-2019 4th Edition","The first group of articles attempt to give some insight into how we behave that is reasonably free of theoretical delusions. In the next three groups I comment on three of the principal delusions preventing a sustainable world — technology, religion and politics (cooperative groups). People believe that society can be saved by them, so I provide some suggestions in the rest of the book as to why this is unlikely via short articles and reviews of recent books by well-known writers. 
 
America and the world are in the process of collapse from excessive population growth, most of it for the last century and now all of it due to 3rd world people. Consumption of resources and the addition of 4 billion more ca. 2100 will collapse industrial civilization and bring about starvation, disease, violence and war on a staggering scale. Billions will die and nuclear war is all but certain. In America this is being hugely accelerated by massive immigration and immigrant reproduction, combined with abuses made possible by democracy. Depraved human nature inexorably turns the dream of democracy and diversity into a nightmare of crime and poverty. The root cause of collapse is the inability of our innate psychology to adapt to the modern world, which leads people to treat unrelated persons as though they had common interests. This, plus ignorance of basic biology and psychology, leads to the social engineering delusions of the partially educated who control democratic societies. Few understand that if you help one person you harm someone else — there is no free lunch and every single item anyone consumes destroys the earth beyond repair. Consequently, social policies everywhere are unsustainable and one by one all societies without stringent controls on selfishness will collapse into anarchy or dictatorship. Without dramatic and immediate changes, there is no hope for preventing the collapse of America, or any country that follows a democratic system. Hence my essay “Suicide by Democracy”. It is also now clear that the seven sociopaths who rule China are winning world war 3, and so my concluding essay on them. The only greater threat is Artificial Intelligence which I comment on briefly in the last paragraph.",,2019.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,780,100557396,M. Starks,,,,,,,,,,,"Sociology, Philosophy",Review
781,The Superfluousness of Big Brother: Charting the Evolution of Surveillance in Twentieth and Twenty First Century American and Global Anglophone Literature and Television,"This dissertation charts the evolution of surveillance as presented in twentieth and twenty-first century American and Global Anglophone literature and television. It analyzes six exemplary works: 1984, The Circle, Black Mirror, Purity, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, and The Lowland. It seeks to move beyond the scope of Benthamite and Foucauldian approaches to surveillance studies in order to examine the post-panoptic structures of the synopticon and the banopticon. To this end, this dissertation argues the six illustrative works mentioned above help underscore the shift from the few watching the many to the many watching the few. It seeks to explain the paradox whereby the televisual capabilities have never been more powerful yet the need for them has been rendered superfluous by an attitudinal, paradigmatic shift in western society. Finally, this dissertation endeavors to explain how literature productively complicates the issue of watching and how, paradoxically, we have never been better connected while simultaneously never been more alone. It posits another paradox as a solution: that we can know someone better by reading their words than by connecting with them through “social media.” INDEX WORDS: Surveillance, Panopticon, Synopticon, Banopticon, Social media THE SUPERFLUOUSNESS OF BIG BROTHER: CHARTING THE EVOLUTION OF SURVEILLANCE IN TWENTIETH AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AMERICAN AND GLOBAL ANGLOPHONE LITERATURE AND TELEVISION",,2019.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,781,2059399006,Ryan Pine,,,,,,,,,,,History,

783,The Structural Adjustment Programmes in Egyptian Agriculture: Reservations on Policies and their Impact,"Monitoring the effects of stabilization policies and Structural Adjustment Programmes in the light of the peculiar characteristics of Egyptian agriculture and medium-term speculations indicates that these policies will not realize their set objectives. On the contrary, the slow rate of economic development, signs of inequality, and the risks of deterioration in the agricultural environment have come to the surface and may possibly express them- selves more clearly in the future. This chapter introduces many of these issues and the arguments that support this conclusion which include the fol- lowing: 1) market failure; 2) negative effects on poor holders; 3) deterioration of landless farmers' daily pay; 4) high increase in the prices of production inputs beyond the means of smallholders; 5) remarkable decrease in the value of agricultural exports; 6) private sector's tendency towards monopoly; 7) dangers of adulteration in production inputs specially in seeds and pesticides as a result of the absence of an effective quality control system; 8) negative effects on agricultural environment, productivity and water distribution due to the elimination of the cropping pattern; 9) deepening inequality in land tenure and ownership and the increase in the number and proportion of landless farmers due to the liberalization of the cultivated land market; 10) difficulties of increasing productivity under the current agricultural research, extension and co-operative sys- tems which lack organic linkage and efficient performance; 11) expected inability of privatized (formerly state-run) companies to attain their objectives. It is rather expected that state resources would be wasted out, and that a tendency towards concentricity of wealth and ownership in lands and capital assets is now emerging.",,1995.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,783,102943889,M.

786,Grinding privacy in the Internet of Bodies: An empirical qualitative research on dating mobile applications for men who have sex with men,"The 'Internet of Bodies' (IoB) is the latest development of the Internet of Things. It encompasses a variety of phenomena, from implanted smart devices to the informal regulation of body norms in online communities. This article presents the results of empirical qualitative research on dating mobile applications for men who have sex with men ('MSM apps'). The pair IoB-privacy is analysed through two interwoven perspectives: the intermediary liability of the MSM app providers and the responsibility for discriminatory practices against the users' physical appearance (aesthetic discrimination). On the one hand, privacy constitutes the justification of the immunities from intermediary liability (so-called safe harbours). Indeed, it is believed that if online intermediaries were requested to play an active role (eg by policing their platforms to prevent their users from carrying out illegal activities) this would infringe the users' privacy. This article calls into question this justification. On the other hand, in an age of ubiquitous surveillance, one may think that the body is the only place where the right to be left alone can be effective. This article contests this view by showing that the users' bodies are no longer the sanctuary of privacy. Bodies are observed, measured, and sometimes change as a result of the online experience. This research adopted an empirical qualitative multi-layered methodology which included a focus group, structured interviews, an online survey and the text analysis of the Terms of Service, privacy policies and guidelines of a number of MSM apps.",,2018.0,0,1,0,False,,,,,,786,69407268,G.

Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China.

 This article turns a critical eye on the arguments deployed by Pitchfork, one of the most popular music websites, when reviewing two artists: Vampire Weekend and Lil Wayne. Rhetorically analyzing the reception of these two artists is illuminating because both had indie breakouts in 2008, both release genre-spanning music, and both have had over a decade of commercial success. However, Vampire Weekend’s whiteness enables them to benefit from authenticity tropes that are unavailable to Lil Wayne. The analysis will show how Lil Wayne is essentialized as a rapper who is unauthorized to move beyond that genre. Overall, this article examines authenticity as the rhetorical move by which exclusion is constructed and highlights how assumptions about the relationship between race and performance are key to arguments about artistry.",,2021.0,43,1,0,False,,,,,,794,153211793,Margaret A.

Most organochlorine compounds were detected in the fish and shellfish group (No. 10), the meat and egg group (No. 11) and the milk and dairy products group (No. 12), and these groups were considered to be the main route of intake of the compounds from the diet. The daily intake of PCBs in the period ranged from 0. 25 jig to 4. 31 jig. Others were as follows: DDTs, 0. 56 to 4. 77 jig; HCHs, 0. 05 to 3. 65 jig; chlordanes, 0. 18 to 1. 51 jig; HCE, ND to 0. 17 jig; HCB, ND to 0. 90 jig; and dieldrin, ND to 0. 49 jig. All the intakes were lower than the acceptable daily intake recommended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan or the FAO/WHO. The time-courses and the values are compared with those of other countries. (Received March 5, 1997)",,1997.0,0,10,0,True,,,,,,798,90532587,K. Kuwabara,49395921,H. Matsumoto,47920735,Y.

801,Results of the 1991-1992 Illinois Pheasant Hunter Survey,"Purchasers of the (1990) Illinois Pheasant Stamp were surveyed via mail-letter questionnaire to determine their activities and harvest during the 1991 season, and their attitudes and opinions toward pheasant hunting regulations and related issues. The mailing list consisted of 3,867 individuals, 2,751 (71%) of which returned usable questionnaires. Because 908 (33%) of the respondents did not hunt pheasants in Illinois again in 1991, the effective sample was reduced to 1,843 active pheasant hunters. Of these hunters, 81% pursued wild pheasants (82% of days afield) and 35% shot game-farm pheasants (18% of days afield). Hunters of wild pheasants were afield an average of 7.1 days (48% in November and 46% in December), and they harvested an average of 3.9 pheasants; 28% took 0 pheasant, 16% took 1 pheasant, 13% took 2 pheasants, and 22% took 3-5 pheasants. Wild pheasant hunters took 0 birds on 62% of their days afield, 1 bird on 23% of their days, and 2 birds (daily bag limit) on 15% of their days. Almost all (93%) of their hunting activity was on private land, 88% of which was owned by an acquaintance other than a relative. Of the hunters (26%) who hunted on CRP (U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program) land, 82% thought the program helped pheasant populations. Game-farm pheasant hunters were afield an average of 3.7 days, and they harvested an average of 7.4 pheasants. Majorities (>50%) of all groups of pheasant hunters usually or always wear a blaze (hunter) orange upper outer garment and cap when afield, and majorities of these groups considered it appropriate to mandate the wearing of such apparel for upland game (rabbit, quail, pheasant, and partridge) hunters. Except for some uncertainty about the contribution of game-farm pheasants, the findings of this survey support and expand upon the conclusions of the initial (1990) pheasant hunter survey. The survey reported herein is the second of two that were scheduled for pheasant hunters in Illinois. The first survey, conducted following the 1990-91 hunting season, devoted considerable space to issues related to the management of state2 owned controlled pheasant hunting areas and projects for Illinois Pheasant Stamp funding (Anderson and David 1991a). Although both surveys included several questions about hunter activity and type (wild or game-farm) of pheasant hunted, the 1991-92 survey placed more emphasis on the activities of wild pheasant hunters on private land. It should also be noted that the mailing lists for the 199192 survey (Illinois Pheasant Stamp purchasers) and 1990-91 survey (pheasant hunters identified via the Hunter Harvest Survey) were derived from different sources. Surveys such as these are the only practical vehicle the Illinois Department of Conservation (DOC) has for becoming familiar with the activities and attitudes of hunters statewide. Thus, the purpose of the pheasant hunter surveys was to determine when and where hunters are in the field, characteristics of their pheasant harvest, and their opinions of pheasant hunting regulations and related issues. These surveys improve the DOC's understanding of the rank-and-file hunter--i.e., the feelings of the ""silent majority""--toward the pheasant resource and the sport of pheasant hunting. This survey is one in a series scheduled for upland game hunters in Illinois. A rabbit hunter survey was conducted following the 1989 season (Anderson and David 1991b); the initial pheasant hunter survey was conducted following the 1990 season (Anderson and David 1991a); and a quail hunter survey was conducted following the 1991 season (Anderson and David 1992). Dove hunters will be surveyed at the end of the 1992 season, and if plans go as scheduled, hunters of ""miscellaneous"" species (e.g., gray 3 partridge, woodcock, crow, woodchuck) will be surveyed following the 1993 season. Rabbit hunters will be surveyed again in 1994 or 1995. METHODS AND MATERIALS A 4-page, 24-question questionnaire was developed specifically for the 1991-92 Illinois Pheasant Hunter Survey (Fig. 1). This questionnaire and a letter of explanation (Fig. 2) were mailed to 3,867 potential pheasant hunters on 7 January 1992. Nonrespondents were sent 2nd and 3rd copies of the questionnaire, and accompanying letters (Figs. 3 and 4), on 18 February and 27 March, respectively. As of 15 June 1992, 2,751 usable questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 71%. The mailing list for the 1991-92 Illinois Pheasant Hunter Survey was developed by systematically selecting stubs from the sales of 86,000 (from total of 104,551) of the 1990 Illinois Pheasant Stamps. The stamps are printed with matching (i.e., same I.D. numbers) stubs attached. Vendors are instructed to write each stamp purchaser's name and mailing address on the stub, and to return the stubs to the DOC Permit Office in Springfield. The people on the list were notified by letters postmarked 22 October 1991 that they would receive a questionnaire at the close of the hunting season. The notice included a form for keeping records of hunting activity and pheasants harvested (Fig. 5). Data were transferred from the filled-out questionnaires to a computer file using a data management program (IBM dBASE III+). The data were analyzed with a statistical program (IBM SPSS/PC+ 4 V2.0). Because a relatively large number of hunters was sampled, it was possible to present the results for wild pheasant hunters relative to the North Zone, South Zone, and the entire state. HUNTING REGULATIONS IN 1991 For purposes of setting the 1991 hunting seasons for wild pheasants and other upland game species, the state was divided into north and south zones. The line that separated these zones was route US-36 from the Indiana state line west to Springfield, route IL-29 north to Pekin, and route IL-9 west to the Iowa state line. The 1991 season for wild pheasants began on 2 November throughout the state and extended to 1 January in the North Zone and to 5 January in the South Zone. The bag limit was 2 cocks (males) per day and 4 in possession. Legal shooting time began at sunrise and ended at sunset. For game-farm (pen-reared) pheasants, the season extended (with some exceptions) from 1 September to 15 April on private licensed preserves and from 6 November to 15 December (except closed Mondays and Tuesdays) on state controlled pheasant areas. On private licensed preserves, there was no daily bag limit and either sex could be taken. On state controlled areas, hunters were limited to 2 birds of either sex. FINDINGS Of the 2,751 individuals who filled out and returned questionnaires, 87% purchased an Illinois resident hunting license in 1991, 71% purchased a 1991 Illinois Pheasant Stamp for personal 5 use, and 67% hunted pheasants in Illinois in 1991-92, and 8% hunted pheasants in another state in 1991-92 (Table 1). Thus, the effective sample for this survey was reduced to 1,843 active resident pheasant hunters. Hunter Activities Of the 1,843 active pheasant hunters, 81% hunted wild pheasants and 35% hunted game-farm pheasants during the 1991 season (Table 2). Further breakdown of the data indicate that 66% hunted wild pheasants only, 19% hunted game-farm pheasants only, and 15% hunted both types of pheasants. When combined with data from the Hunter Harvest Survey (Anderson and Campbell 1992), these findings indicate that an estimated 73,345 individuals hunted wild pheasants only, 21,500 hunted game-farm pheasants only, and 17,133 hunted both wild and game-farm pheasants in Illinois in 1991-92. For hunters who pursued wild pheasants, 90.9% were active in the North Zone and 9.1% were active in the South Zone. The hunters expended 82% of their days afield pursuing wild pheasants and 18% of their days shooting game-farm pheasants (Table 2). Hunters of wild pheasants devoted an average of 7.1 days to the field during the 1991 season (Table 3). In comparison, the annual Hunter Harvest Survey indicated that (wild) pheasant hunters spent an average of 6.5 days afield during the 1991 season (Anderson and Campbell 1992). When data in Table 2 and from the Hunter Harvest Survey were combined, an estimated 616,661 days afield were devoted to hunting wild pheasants and 136,283 days were devoted to game-farm pheasants in Illinois in 1991-92. 6 The hunters expended 46% of their (wild) pheasant-hunting days in November, 48% in December, and 6% in January (Table 3). The ""use rate"" (i.e., days hunted/number of days available to hunt) was greater for November (0.12) than for December (0.11). This is in contrast to rabbit hunters and quail hunters, whose use rates were greater in December than in November (Anderson and David 1991b, 1992). Of the hunters who pursued wild pheasants, 45% were in the field on opening day of the 1991 season, which was characterized by decreasing temperatures, strong northwest winds, and intermittent rain (Table 4). On the second day, when temperatures averaged 20° F, 36% of the hunters were afield. In addition, 26% were-afield on both opening day and on the second day, and 55% were afield on opening day and/or on the second day. Similarly, 47% of the hunters claimed to have been in the field during Ž1 of the last 5 days of the season in the North Zone. The vast majority (88%) of the wild pheasant hunters pursued their sport on land owned or rented by acquaintances other than relatives (Table 5). About two-thirds of these owners or renters were long-time (>5 years) acquaintances. Another 25% of the hunters were active on land owned or rented by relatives, and 11% hunted on their own land. Although the leasing of land specifically for pheasant hunting occurred at a low rate (2% of hunters), it was more prevalent in the North Zone than in the South Zone. Of the hunters who pursued game-farm pheasants during the 1991 season, 10% released their own birds, 33% were active on private 7 licensed preserves, and 68% utilized state controlled areas (Table 6).

It responds to Neal and colleagues’ (2019) call for research to improve the state of and access to knowledge about psychological assessments in legal contexts, and encourages critical thinking about forensic assessment in the spirit of improvement. These articles offer clarity about the strengths and weaknesses of a number of assessment instruments to inform psychologists’ preparation for expert testimony, lawyers’ preparation for direct and cross-examination, judges’ evidence admissibility determinations, and scholars’ future research. We assembled teams of authors with different perspectives and areas of expertise to review each tool fairly, including several adversarial collaborations. Articles on the Rorschach and R-PAS, MMPI-3, PCL-R, MCMI-IV and MACI-II, PAI and PAI-A, SIRS-2, HCR-20V3, TSI and TSI-2, and the MacCAT-CA, ECST-R, and CAST*MR are included. To increase visibility, accessibility, and impact, this issue is published as free access, meaning the articles are available to download without charge. We anticipate these articles will be widely read and useful to scholars and practitioners in both psychology and law.

811,"Integrating the Physically Disabled Children into Regular Schools in Kenya. An Analysis of Causes of Marginalization, the Life Situation of the Disabled Children and Proposals for enhancing their Inclusion and Welfare. A Case Study of Machakos District","The causes of disability in Kenya were associated w ith medical conditions and violation of societal moral rules. Polio was a chief cause and s o were birth defects caused by lack of antenatal and post-natal care. Other birth defects resulting into congenital disabilities were caused by malnutrition among the expectant mothers and young children. Disability was also associated with offences against the ancestors. The disabled were seen as a bad omen and a curse, as a result of which, they were stigmatised, marginalized and concealed from public life. The history of the disabled in Kenya has evolved ov er the decades from the separation phase, to the care taking, rehabilitation, integration and to the inclusion phase. In the separation phase, the disabled were ignored, rejected, exploit ed, used for ritual purposes or simply left to die. In the care-taking phase, the disabled people rec ived custodial care in asylums and isolated institutions to protect them from the soci ety and to protect the society from them. In the institutions, the disabled received medical car e and skills to make them employable. This method of institutionalised care was introduced to Kenya by Western Missionaries during the colonial period and marked the beginning of western ype of special education in Kenya by the time. Towards the end of 1960’s, organizations for the di sabled in many countries started to formulate a new concept of disability that indicate d the close connection between the limitations experienced by the disabled, the design and structure of their environments and the attitudes of the general public towards the disable d. This new concept became known as the social theory of disability. The social theory of d isability approach sees the problems the disabled people face as arising from the barriers t he society has failed to remove, rather than arising from the medical conditions the disabled ha ve. It aims at integrating and including the disabled in the society by tackling the barriers th ey face rather than relying on curing the impairments. After independence in 1963, the policy for the disa bled changed with the establishment of rehabilitation training programmes. The focus was o n training, prevention and rehabilitation of the disabled. Emphasis was placed on the rights of the disabled to become full-fledged members in the society and to remove the barriers t o participation. This ushered in a new phase of integration and inclusion based on the dev elopment of such concepts as full participation, equality, a just society and educati on for all. The present Kenyan education policy for integrating the physically disabled children is the result of developments in disability over the past 40 years. It reflects the general living conditions and socio-economic policies of different times. There are however circumstances that have influenced the living situations of the p hysically disabled children. These include negative traditional attitudes towards the causes o f disabilities, undeveloped policies leading to poor services for the disabled, low levels of resea rch in the field of disabilities and lack of adequate political will among others. The integration and inclusion of the disabled into everyday life in Kenya has not been mainstreamed although the recent passing of the Persons with Disabilities Law 2004 shows some commitment by the government to the welfare of the disabled. Efforts to include the x disabled into the society are being made by the Cat holic Diocese of Machakos that has established Small homes to access education for the physically disabled children in regular schools. Despite the efforts, there is lack of unde rstanding about the terminology “integration” and how it can be achieved in Kenya. The words “spe cial”, “integrated” and “inclusive” are normally used inter-changeably. The government posi tion s that the physically disabled need “special education” by “special teachers” in “speci al schools” with “special facilities”. For the Catholic Diocese of Machakos (DDS), integration mea ns “inclusion” based on the right of the disabled children to access education in regular sc hools where they can be guaranteed of their right to grow up with their parents, siblings and e xtended families. Lack of a clear legislation and policy framework for the integration of the phy sically disabled children in Kenya has influenced the quality of education for the disable d. Education practitioners in the field of disability have not provided with confidence and in tegrity an appropriate education for the physically disabled children. This study sought to find out the root causes of th e marginalization of the physically disabled children in Machakos district of Kenya and their li fe situation. It aimed at coming up with proposals for integrating physically disabled child ren into regular schools and to enhance their welfare. It aimed at furthering the understanding o f marginalization and the principles of Inclusive Education (IE). Through an analysis of th e practice by the Small homes programme and the government’s segregated special education p rovision, lessons for effective integration of the physically disabled children were learnt. It must however be noted that, although this study focused on the physically disabled children a nd their policies and services, some of the proposed interventions for enhancing their welfare can only be achieved through an overhaul of the general services for all the people. A good example here is transport services and the implementation of the Persons with Disabilities Law 2004. The goal of this study was achieved by carrying out a research in Machakos district of Kenya. This study focused on four priority themes: (i) T he availability and accessibility of services for the physically disabled children including educ ation, training, medical care, transport, and employment. (ii) The existing policies for the phys ically disabled and how these affect their services. (iii) The understanding of disabilities a nd the attitude people have towards the disabled. (iv) The level of research in the field o f disability. Data on the above were collected by carrying out face-to-face interviews and one Foc us group Discussion among a sample size of 170. The data were analysed using content analys is. The study findings show that although education is considered a basic right and need, its access and provision to the physically disabled chi ldren in Machakos district has experienced problems that impede its implementation. Despite th government’s commitment to free primary school education, implementation of integra ted education to the physically disabled children is faced with constraints. These include: lack of clarity of the policy of integration, negative traditional beliefs towards disabilities, the approach of implementing integrated education, low parental participation, lengthy asse s ment procedures of disabilities, lack of adequate specialist teachers, limited data on disab ilities and limited access to education caused by high fees levies, lack of suitable transport ser vic s and access to mobility aids and suitable physical environment and amenities. The disabled ar disadvantaged in the labour market due to lack of training and skills. Further study findings show that Inclusive Educatio n can work and that reservations to Inclusive Education can be overcome. Although most par icipants displayed positive attitudes towards Inclusive Education in Small homes as oppos ed to segregated provision in Special xi schools, the findings showed that the Small homes n eed to make their school environments least restrictive for the physically disabled child ren and to adapt an inclusive culture. The Small homes were preferred for their inclusive poli cies of integration, their decentralized nature and benefits derived by the disabled, the no n-disabled and the communities from the Small homes. Such benefits included acceptance, pos itive social relationships, enhanced academic performance and soft skills for self-indep endence. Opposition to Special schools was based on the negative effects to the children i ncluding segregation, disruption to family life, low social and academic grounding. This study has shown that with the entry of physica lly disabled into school, the attitudes of teachers, parents, and pupils changed as they reali zed that the disabled children had the potential to learn. The disabled were aware of thei r disabilities and limitations, but these did not affect their self-esteem and ambitions. Those w ho had good education and awareness about disabilities were more positive about them an d their potential. Attitudes are therefore changeable. The disabled suffered marginalisation in accessing their basic services. They lacked adequate access to affordable suitable transport and this ex cluded (marginalisation) and isolated them from the day-to-day activities. The physically disa bled children did not get adequate counselling, health care information, and the neces sary medical services including surgery, physiotherapy, and mobility aids. The disabled stud ents had only three choices of trades to pursue. These included tailoring, leatherwork and d ressmaking. They had a shortage of teachers and limited resources for conducting attac hment and acquisition of working tools. The following were identified as areas of improveme nt on the services of the physically disabled children. There should be a more aggressiv plan for community sensitisation about the needs, rights, services and a plan for mobiliza tion of resources for the disabled.

813,"Testimony of Gail Heriot Professor of Law, University of San Diego & Member, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Before the Appropriations Committee of the California Assembly on ACA-5 June 2, 2020","Abstract: In 1996, California voters adopted Proposition 209, which amended the state constitution. Its operative clause states: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” In 2020, the California Assembly’s Committee on Appropriations considered ACA-5, a bill that, if passed and approved by the voters, will repeal Proposition 209. The Appropriations Committee has jurisdiction over only the effects of the bill on state finances. Testimony was thus limited to that issue. Professor Heriot’s testimony discusses those effects, which she believes will be very extensive, particularly in the area of public contracting.",,2020.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,813,52561070,Gail L.

814,Analysis of an Industrial and Raw Material Facility as a Socio-Economic System,"This article considers one of the most important directions, namely, the development of a mineral resource object as regards its comparison with the socio-economic system. Currently exploration and development of prospective land areas not only for the formation of industrial and raw material facilities on them, but also for further creation of commodities-based industries and mineral assemblage dealing with extraction and processing of commercial minerals besides further profit and including final product output, are particularly relevant. In the article, the authors consider the socio-economic system, its main components and functions, interaction of system elements due to their relations and external factors that affect the functioning of this system. The author's definition of the concept of socio-economic system is given. The concept of an industrial raw material facility, its sys-tem-forming elements and interaction between them are viewed. The authors propose a general model for the management and control of an industrial raw material facility, the main factors affecting its functioning are considered in detail. A comparative analysis of the model of the socio-economic system and the general model of an industrial and raw material facility is carried out. It has been proved that the industrial and raw material facility is a socio-economic system. The main application tasks that can be solved on the basis of the author's model for management and control of an industrial and raw material facility are represented. Specifically there are many scientific papers devoted to either the issue of managing and controlling the development of territories or geological and economic valuation of deposits as well as various methods and models, while each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.",2020 International Multi-Conference on Industrial Engineering and Modern Technologies (FarEastCon),2020.0,20,2,0,False,,,,,,814,82957268,E.

816,"Good Game, Well Played: A Ethnographic Study of Collegiate Esport in Southern California","Anthropologists have previously engaged in virtual fieldwork in order to discover and document different large online worlds such as World of Warcraft (Nardi 2010), Everquest (Taylor 2006), Second Life (Boellstroff 2008). These ethnographies cover a multitude of topics such as motivations for playing, gender disparity, addiction, and language. This thesis looks away from the large online role-playing worlds, yet take inspiration from previous anthropological works in order to take a closer look at university students in Orange County in California who spend their time playing competitive video games for social and economic rewards. I observed and documented two teams of collegiate esports players during their weekly training sessions and performed informal interview with persons on collegiate esports teams, university staff, tournament hosts, student run gaming organizations, tech companies, sponsors, and esports fans. This thesis connects to the growing literature on video games as it explores ways in which collegiate esports players create new forms of language and social relations. It delves deep into the in-game linguistics communications players use to succeed in their competitions, and how specialized negative and positive lexical words are created and used to describe established emotions of rage or respect towards opposing and friendly players. I attempt to show how traditional understandings of playing games and sports are applicable to esports, and how concepts of “fun” and “work” challenge each other when recreational activities become professionalized and award participants with social and economic rewards. Research also led me to study how collegiate esport players use and understand spatial navigation in the games, using game developers “camera” creation in order to traverse and navigate the virtual worlds they inhabit. This research also looks at how the video game culture has stereotypically been seen as a homosocial sphere for men. How these stereotypes have played into society making it difficult many people to participate despite no physical limitations for doing so. I attempt to shed light on important aspects of the disparity of gender in the wider gaming culture, yet show hope that efforts are being made to create a more open culture for all gamers. Finally I briefly discuss gendered time obligations and how the moral panics of video game addiction can distract mainstream society from life struggles of individuals.",,2018.0,74,1,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'uib.no', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/bitstream/handle/1956/17860/Good-Game--Well-Played---Skoglund-2018.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y'}]",PI Skoglund - 2018 - bora.uib.no,,816,113516977,P.

817,"Determinants of Non-paid Task Division in Gay-, Lesbian-, and Heterosexual-Parent Families With Infants Conceived Using Artificial Reproductive Techniques","Background: The division of non-paid labor in heterosexual parents in the West is usually still gender-based, with mothers taking on the majority of direct caregiving responsibilities. However, in same-sex couples, gender cannot be the deciding factor. Inspired by Feinberg’s ecological model of co-parenting, this study investigated whether infant temperament, parent factors (biological relatedness to child, psychological adjustment, parenting stress, and work status), and partner relationship quality explained how first-time gay, lesbian, and heterosexual parents divided labor (childcare and family decision-making) when their infants were 4 and 12 months old. We also tested whether family type acted as a moderator. Method: Participants were drawn from the new parents study. Only those who provided information about their biological relatedness to their child (N = 263 parents) were included. When infants were 4 months (T1), parents completed a password-protected online questionnaire exploring their demographic characteristics including work status and standardized online-questionnaires on task division (childcare and family decision-making), infant temperament, parental anxiety, parental depression, parental stress, and partner relationship satisfaction. When infants were 12-months-old (T2), parents provided information about task division and their biological relatedness to their children. Results: Linear mixed models showed that no factor explained the division of family decision making at T1 and T2. For relative time spent on childcare tasks at T1, biological relatedness mattered for lesbian mothers only: biologically related mothers appeared to spend more time on childcare tasks than did non-related mothers. Results showed that, regardless of family type, parents who were not working or were working part-time at T1 performed more childcare tasks at T1. This was still true at T2. The other factors did not significantly contribute to relative time spent on childcare tasks at T2. Conclusion: We had the opportunity to analyze the division of non-paid tasks in families where parenting was necessarily planned and in which gender could not affect that division. Although Feinberg’s model of co-parenting suggests that various factors are related to task division, we found that paid work outside the home was most important during the first year of parenthood in determining caregiving roles.",Frontiers in Psychology,2020.0,84,6,0,True,"Although Feinberg’s model of co-parenting suggests that various factors are related to task division, it is found that paid work outside the home was most important during the first year of parenthood in determining caregiving roles.",,,,,817,1693315488,Loes Van Rijn - Van Gelderen,1405459837,K.

819,The Power of a Black Superheroine: Exploring Black Female Identities in Comics and Fandom Culture,"Author(s): Gipson, Grace D. | Advisor(s): Elliott, Chiyuma; De Kosnik, Abigail | Abstract: 2018 begins on very promising note for comic book fans, as the long-awaited Marvel Comics Black Panther film premieres in February. While Black Panther is the first black superhero comic character to appear in American comics in July 1966, and his stories are plentiful, the adventures of America’s first black superheroine are few and disparate. The appearance of “The Butterfly,” America’s first black superheroine is not as well-known and documented along with many other noteworthy black female superheroines in comic books. The black female superheroine’s narrative, a diverse and complex one, is slowly building traction and worthy of scholarly attention. Her narrative is crucial and significant to the overall story of American comics. Thus, examining various Black female superheroine stories offers an opportunity to (re)explore new identities and territories in comics, reframe our understanding of certain terminology and concepts, and most notably to empower the black female voice.",,2019.0,109,0,0,False,,Book,"[{'title': 'escholarship.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://escholarship.org/content/qt7d89f0h8/qt7d89f0h8.pdf'}]",GD Gipson - 2019 - search.proquest.com,,819,116373969,Grace D.

820,Psychosocial Hazards in the Workplace as an Aspect of Horizontal Segregation in the Nursing Profession,"The purpose of this article was to assess the influence of psychosocial hazards as a factor affecting the presence of men in the nursing profession. The article refers to the topic of particularly low representation of men among nursing staff in Poland, in comparison to what similar statistics show for other countries. The aim of the study was to assess whether the psychosocial hazards in the nursing profession constitute a significant factor in the small number of men present in this occupation. In this article psychosocial hazards are considered as all the aspects of management and work organization that may negatively affect the employee's mental and physical health. The research was conducted from September 2017 to April 2018 in the Podlaskie Voivodeship (Poland). A total of 640 respondents working as nurses in inpatient health care facilities, of which 87% were women and 13% were men, were included in the study. A standardized Work Design Questionnaire for an objective assessment of work stressfulness was used as a research tool. The research has been run by a group of experts, who explained the aim and the meaning of the particular questions to the surveyed group. Afterwards, based on the answers and observations of the responders, the experts filled in the questionnaire. The results of the study show that in almost all the evaluated aspects, the nursing profession was assessed more negatively by surveyed men than women. The most negative aspects reported by women included hazards (a score of 60), complexity (58.3), and haste (50.0), while those reported by men included haste (70.0), complexity (66.7), and hazards (65.0). As a conclusion it has been noticed, that results received from the research confirm that psychosocial hazards may have significant impact on the number of men present in the nursing profession in Poland. This study also suggests that the greater psychosocial hazards experienced by male nurses in the workplace may be an effect of the particularly low representation of men among practicing nursing staff.",Frontiers in Psychology,2018.0,72,9,0,False,Results received from the research confirm that psychosocial hazards may have significant impact on the number of men present in the nursing profession in Poland and suggest that the greater psychossocial hazards experienced by male nurses in the workplace may be an effect of the particularly low representation of men among practicing nursing staff.,Pdf,"[{'title': 'frontiersin.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/6176/pdf#page=93'}]","K Kowalczuk, E Krajewska-Kułak… - Psychosocial Risks and …, 2019 - frontiersin.org",,820,5634687,K.

825,Mining for Meaning: Reflections on Upton Sinclair's King Coal and Tawni O'Dell's Sister Mine,"In his introduction to Upton Sinclair's novel King Coal (1917], George Brandes refers to Sinclair as ""an exposer of social conditions"" (9], and biographer Anthony Arthur notes that Sinclair was ""a self-described socialist propagandist"" (xii). Arthur writes that socialists like Sinclair ""who wanted the bloodless overthrow of capitalism agreed that it would have to come about through education and persuading American citizens to demand it.... The only way to reach enough people to effect change in this period [the early twentieth century] was through print"" (39]. In fact, Sinclair believed that it was fiction, in particular, that had the potential to be far reaching (Arthur 46]. Although he was a novelist, Sinclair was among the journalists of the early twentieth century who came to be known as muckrakers, a derogatory term coined by President Theodore Roosevelt. Ann Bausum notes, though, that these writers had a ""commitment to get to the bottom of a sto- ry"" (13] and that by portraying the grim reality of America's working class, ""Sinclair hoped to provoke outrage among readers"" (48].Indeed, Sinclair's desire to expose what he called ""the 'wage slavery' of workers"" (Arthur 41] led to the publication of several works, including his most celebrated novel, The Jungle (1906]. However, as Sinclair scholar R. N. Mookerjee laments, King Coal has been mostly ignored. Mookerjee refers to King Coal as a ""very successful and effective fusion of journalistic excellence and creative imagination,"" and he believes it ""is undoubtedly one of Sinclair's more artistic achievements"" (62]. It is for this reason that it is worth reexamining this overlooked and mostly forgotten work about the coal mining industry as it nears the 100th anniversary of its publication. Contemporary novelist Tawni O'Dell, whose bestselling novels are set in the coal-mining region of southwestern Pennsylvania, has become the voice of today's coal miners and has even been compared to French author Emile Zola (O'Dell, ""Stung By"" par. 2], whose novel Germinal is celebrated for its portrayal of a coal mining strike in France in the late nineteenth century. O'Dell's work has not yet been examined in relationship to Sinclair. In fact, although the settings of the novels differ, as do the time periods in which they are set, Sinclair's King Coal and O'Dell's Sister Mine (2007] portray the dangers of coal mining, and through a comparison of the two novels, one sees that little has changed in the underground coal mining industry during the ninety years that have passed between the novels' publication dates.King Coal is the result of the deadly Colorado Fuel and Iron strike, also known as the Ludlow Massacre, that lasted for more than a year, a strike that Priscilla Long identifies as ""one of the most grueling, longlasting industrial conflicts in the history of the United States"" (63]. Sinclair was quick to support striking workers, and when three thousand miners went on strike in 1913, he saw this as a potential subject for a novel that would be an expose of the coal mining industry. Sinclair made several trips to Colorado so that he could accurately represent the ""wage slavery"" that was occurring in the mines, and Mookerjee says that Sinclair ""took pains to see that his facts... were authentic"" (63]. The novel is the product of these trips and is told from the perspective of Hal Warner, a naive, wealthy college student who wishes to be ""an observer of conditions"" (Sinclair 57] in the coal camps. The reader eventually learns that Hal is, in fact, the son of a great coal magnate, and despite the fact that he was raised to believe that miners are ""turbulent"" and ""lazy,"" he knows that he cannot overlook what he witnesses firsthand: that conditions in the coal mines are deliberately and needlessly ""cruel"" (Sinclair 57].In the novel's postscript, Sinclair explains that he did not identify a specific locale for the novel ""for the reason that such conditions are to be found as far apart as West Virginia, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, and Colorado"" (214). …",,2014.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,825,52552999,D.

826,Factors Related to Ethnocultural Empathy Among White Counselor Education Faculty: Implications for African American Male Students.,"Cultural competence represents a central element of the professional practices exhibited by professional counselors and counselor educators (CACREP, 2016). Inconsistent with the place it holds in the field, cultural competence has been minimally studied among those responsible for gatekeeping, teaching, supervision, and research – faculty. Among variables relevant to measurable outcomes is ethnocultural empathy (EE), ideal as it is described as a combination of empathic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward others with whom you have differences in cultural identities and experiences (Wang et al., 2003). This study sought to add to the body of literature on the cross-racial interactions between counselor education faculty and the diverse students enrolled in counselortraining programs. Specifically, emphasis was placed on interactions between faculty who identify as White and African American college men, by assessing the moderating role of openness to diversity (OTD) and direct social contact (DSC) in the relationship between White Racial Identity Attitudes (WRIA) and Ethnocultural Empathy (EE) in a sample of (N = 131) White faculty. Both high levels of OTD and DSC were found to moderate this relationship at some White racial identity statuses, but not all. Two primary implications exist for this study relevant to the field of professional counseling and counselor education. The first is increased academic outcomes among African American male counselors-in-training due to reduced implicit bias communication. The second is pertinent additions to the training of counselor educators to work competently with African American men.",,2018.0,123,1,0,False,,,,,,826,116875575,Courtney R.

828,"Utopia/dystopia, race, gender, and new forms of humanism in women's science fiction","This thesis aims to uncover new forms of humanism grounded in a critique of systems that produce and reify race and gender by staging a conversation between six contemporary works of science fiction (SF) written by women from Italy, France, Spain, and the UK, and five acclaimed theorists in the fields of gender, queer, postcolonial, humanist, and cultural studies: Judith Butler, Rosi Braidotti, Gayatri Spivak, Paul Gilroy, and Jack Halberstam. As outlined in the second chapter, I focus, in particular, on Butler’s conception of subjects who ‘become’ through affective encounters, Braidotti’s critical posthumanism, Spivak and Gilroy’s respective notions of ‘planetarity,’ and Halberstam’s theory of a ‘queer art of failure.’ In doing so, this thesis asserts the complementarity of academic and science fictional enquiries into what I view as examples of new forms of humanism that arise from historicised interrogations of systems of race and gender. The first chapter introduces the way in which SF appeals to women writers who embrace the genre’s political energy and its anti-racist, anti-sexist, and humanistic potential by tracing a genealogy of European women’s SF from the seventeenth century to the present day. The second half of the thesis reads examples of politically charged SF from my corpus alongside the critical theory outlined in the second chapter, in order to demonstrate how SF engages with new forms of humanism through a critique and reformulation of issues of race and gender. I follow this analysis with an exploration of the way in which SF’s unique spatial attributes can probe the borders of the planetary humanisms or ‘planetarity’ proposed by Gilroy and Spivak. I finally assess, by way of a conclusion, the extent to which SF can reassemble and amplify the achievements of these new forms of anti-racist and anti-sexist humanism.",,2019.0,0,1,0,False,,,,,,828,122625011,Eleanor Drage,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

834,A voice was heard in Ramah: the uncontrollable and uncomfortable tears of Black parents as they navigate complex parenting rules and processes in Toronto,"Where children grow up has a major impact on what they become as adults. Towards achieving what is optimal for one’s children, parents across cultures carry out different parenting practices. Despite this, Black parents in Canada feel their parenting practices are unfairly targeted by Child Welfare Agencies (CWA), resulting in the overrepresentation of Black children in the welfare system. This thesis presents qualitative findings on Black parents’ knowledge, perceptions, and experiences of navigating through complex Child protection rules and processes in Toronto, Canada.

835,Got Empathy? A Latent Profile Analysis of Psychotherapists’ Empathic Abilities,"ticipants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index ) [6], a multidimensional measure of empathy consisting of four different subscales: perspective taking (PT) measures the capacity to understand the perspective of others; fantasy (FS) measures the tendency to identify with characters from fictional situations, akin to PT; empathic concern (EC) measures feelings of compassion toward persons in distress; and personal distress (PD) measures self-oriented feelings of distress when facing others’ negative experiences. The internal consistency of the subscales was adequate: 0.75 for PT (mean 2.87 ±.53), 0.77 for FS (mean 2.38 ± 0.70), 0.72 for EC (mean 2.99 ± 0.53), and 0.84 for PD (mean 1.18 ± 0.6). Latent profile analyses were conducted using Mplus 8 to identify subpopulations of clinicians presenting distinct empathy profiles with a robust estimator to nonnormality (robust maximum likelihood). An elbow plot of various indices (AIC, CAIC, BIC, ABIC) was used to select the optimal number of profiles: the CAIC and the BIC reached their lowest values for the four-profile solution, which was also associated with a flattening out in the decrease of the AIC and ABIC. The four-profile solution was thus retained for interpretation and is illustrated in Figure 1. The first profile represented 23% of the respondents and was characterized by below average levels for PT, FS and EC, and the highest level of PD, suggesting a self-absorbed and under-regulated subgroup of clinicians, was labelled “insecure self-absorbed.” Clinicians in this group likely perform rather poorly in both cognitive perspective-taking and in their emotional resonance with patients’ concerns, perhaps focusing largely on their own negative emotional reactions to others’ displays of distress. These clinicians – nearly one-quarter of the sample – may be at risk of becoming overwhelmed by patients’ problems, likely failing to work in the service of therapeutic progress. The second profile represented 26% of the clinicians who exhibited above-average levels for PT and FS, with EC at the highest level compared to other profiles, suggesting a highly empathic group, labelled “empathic immersion.” Clinicians in this group tend to become immersed in others’ emotional experience and are oriented toward intuiting and identifying with the feelings of others. The third and largest profile represented 38% of the clinicians, reflecting “average” empathy and thus inferring the “average expectable clinician.” These clinicians likely display adequate levels of emotional concern and perspective taking toward their patients, with occasional experiences of distress during sessions. Finally, the fourth profile was characterized by the highest level for PT, average level of EC, low level of FS, and lowest value for PD, revealing a more objective empathic style for 13% of the clinicians. These “rational empathic” clinicians would be inclined to adopt an intellectual understanding of their patients’ perspectives (probably based on observations and clinical theories), without emotionally sampling or identifying with their experience, and would probably be highly regulated in their interpersonal interactions. With regard to our secondary objective, multinomial logistic regressions revealed few significant associations between cliniDear Editor, In psychotherapy, clinician empathy is fundamental for guiding supporting behavior in response to the patient’s emotional plight. Empathy – the inferring of another’s emotional state – involves two main aspects: affective sharing and perspective-taking [1]. Affective sharing refers to vicariously experiencing another person’s emotional state with either a desire to help (empathic concern) or a tendency to withdraw (personal distress), whereas perspective-taking refers to deliberately imagining another person’s perspective to understand her/his feelings [2]. A recent meta-analysis [3] reports a significant aggregate association (r = 0.31) between empathy and psychotherapy outcome; empathy had the largest reported effect size among common and specific therapy factors in a recent review [4]. Evidence supporting the role of clinician empathy in psychotherapy has been based on research that considered conveyed empathy. Equally important, however, is the investigation of clinicians’ dispositional capacities for empathic functioning, especially considering that therapist effects have been found to be equal to or greater than effects of specific treatment interventions [4, 5]. Perceptions of clinician empathy likely reflect complex interactions between perceivers’ characteristics and behaviors and clinicians’ empathic dispositions – within contextual factors such as the setting, timing, and phase of the therapeutic relationship. Clinicians can vary in their level of empathy and differ in their ability to constructively utilize empathy in their clinical work. Despite the centrality of clinicians’ empathic abilities, empirical work regarding individual differences is, to our knowledge, nonexistent. The present study was developed to address this gap by investigating clinicians’ profiles of dispositional empathy. A secondary objective was to conduct a preliminary exploration of correlates of empathy profiles. Clinicians (n = 775) with active practice were recruited through professional associations. The participants identified as psychologists (63%), interns (15%), or other mental health professionals (22%) such as psychiatrists. Three-quarters (75%) were female, and the mean years of experience was 14.62 (SD = 11.27). Participants’ theoretical orientations were psychodynamic (44%), cognitive behavioral, (24%), humanistic (13%), and integrative (18%).

836,Sclerotherapy of Peritoneal Inclusion Cysts: Preliminary Results in Seven Patients,"Objective To evaluate the technical feasibility and the clinical effectiveness of sclerotherapy for the treatment of peritoneal inclusion cysts (PICs). Materials and Methods Between June 1996 and February 2001, eight PICs in seven female patients aged 28-43 (mean, 36) years were instilled with sclerosant (povidone-iodine in three, ethanol in three, both povidone-iodine and ethanol in one). All seven patients subsequently experienced less abdominal pain. After drainage via an 8.5-Fr pigtail catheter inserted in the PICs (transabdominally in six cases, transvaginally in one), sclerosant equivalent in volume to about one-third that of drained fluid was introduced daily until the drained volume was less than 5ml. Follow-up by means of clinical procedures and ultrasound was performed every three months, at which time the success rate, possible complications and recurrence were determined. Results Sclerotherapy was technically successful in all seven patients, though immediately after the procedure, minor complications were noted in three patients (mild pain in two, mild fever in one). During the follow-up of 4-60 (mean, 24.7) months, sclerotherapy proved successful and without long-term complications in all seven patients: lower abdominal pain disappeared and the diameter of the cysts decreased more than 50%, with complete regression in four cases. During the follow-up period there was no recurrence.

837,Renewable Energy at NASA's Johnson Space Center,"NASA's Johnson Space Center has implemented a great number of renewable energy systems. Renewable energy systems are necessary to research and implement if we humans are expected to continue to grow and thrive on this planet. These systems generate energy using renewable sources - water, wind, sun - things that we will not run out of. Johnson Space Center is helping to pave the way by installing and studying various renewable energy systems. The objective of this report will be to examine the completed renewable energy projects at NASA's Johnson Space Center for a time span of ten years, beginning in 2003 and ending in early 2014. This report will analyze the success of each project based on actual vs. projected savings and actual vs. projected efficiency. Additionally, both positive and negative experiences are documented so that lessons may be learned from past experiences. NASA is incorporating renewable energy wherever it can, including into buildings. According to the 2012 JSC Annual Sustainability Report, there are 321,660 square feet of green building space on JSC's campus. The two projects discussed here are major contributors to that statistic. These buildings were designed to meet various Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification criteria. LEED Certified buildings use 30 to 50 percent less energy and water compared to non-LEED buildings. The objectives of this project were to examine data from the renewable energy systems in two of the green buildings onsite - Building 12 and Building 20. In Building 12, data was examined from the solar photovoltaic arrays. In Building 20, data was examined from the solar water heater system. By examining the data from the two buildings, it could be determined if the renewable energy systems are operating efficiently. Objectives In Building 12, the data from the solar photovoltaic arrays shows that the system is continuously collecting energy from the sun, as shown by the graph below. Building 12 has two solar inverters, located on the second floor, that collected the data from the solar photovoltaic arrays. The data displayed here is the total energy produced by the system. These are cumulative amounts, so the last point on the graph shows all of the energy collected from the system since the start of its operation. The data shown here was manually collected from the solar inverters. However, the data is also automatically recorded through EBI. Through analysis of both sets of data it was determined that the EBI data was faulty. For example, from the manually collected data it can be determined that a total of 73 kWh of energy was collected between the dates of 1/16/2014 1/22/2014. The EBI data reports that approximately 17800 kWh of energy was collected during the same time frame. Not only does this exceed the time frame examined, but it also exceeds the total energy collected from the start of collection as recorded from the inverters. This leads to the belief that there is a malfunction with the automatic recording of the energy. In Building 20, data was examined from the solar water heater dating back many months and found that the pump for the solar water heater system was not operating properly, as exhibited in the graph shown below.
The pump operates on a solar energy system, meaning that it collects energy throughout the day from the sun. Because of this, the system would stop operating shortly after the sun set because of a lack of sunlight. At that point, the graph should show a zero flow rate, but as exhibited in the graph below, that is not the case. It is clearly shown that the pump is continuously operating, even during the night.
It was also observed that the majority of the time the pump would not turn on at all, despite good weather conditions. This led to the conclusion that the pump is malfunctioning, and needs to be examined and fixed.",,2014.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,837,97567615,Lindsay McDowall,,,,,,,,,,,Engineering,
838,When data crimes are real crimes: voter surveillance and the Cambridge Analytica conflict,"This thesis asks what conditions elevated the Cambridge Analytica (CA) conflict into a sustained and global political issue? Was this a privacy conflict and if so, how was it framed as such? This work demonstrates that the public outcry to CA formed out of three underlying structural conditions: The rise of the alt-right as an ideology, surveillance capitalism, and a growing and unregulated voter analytics industry. A network of actors seized the momentum of this conflict to drive the message that voter surveillance is a threat to democratic elections. These actors humanized the CA conflict and created a catalyst for a large scale public outrage to these previously ignored structures. Their focus on democratic threat also allowed this conflict to transcend the typical contours of a privacy conflict and demonstrate that the consequences of this conflict are societal, rather than personal. Despite these issues, Canada and the United States have yet to address the wider implications of voter surveillance adequately. Voter surveillance can broadly undermine personal autonomy and the democratic system, and will be a central question in upcoming elections.",,2019.0,0,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'uvic.ca', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/bitstream/handle/1828/11075/Gordon_Jesse_MA_2019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y'}]",J Gordon - 2019 - dspace.library.uvic.ca,,838,2070863853,Jesse Gordon,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

841,THE DRUGS/VIOLENCE NEXUS: THEORY TESTING AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACTORS AMONG JUSTICE-INVOLVED APPALACHIAN WOMEN,"OF DISSERTATION THE DRUGS/VIOLENCE NEXUS: THEORY TESTING AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACTORS AMONG JUSTICE-INVOLVED APPALACHIAN WOMEN This study examined the relationship between drug use and violence among justiceinvolved women in Appalachian Kentucky. Goldstein’s (1985) conceptual framework was used as a theoretical guide in formulating the drugs and violence relationships. Therefore, three types of drug use and violence relationships were explored, including: 1) psychopharmacological violence; economic-compulsive violence; and 3) systemic violence. Although these drug-related violence typologies have been investigated, little research has been devoted to rural justice-involved women. Moreover, to date no studies have examined how these drug/violence relationships might be associated with behavioral health factors. Ergo, there were three aims of the current study. First, to build psychopharmacological, economic-compulsive, and systemic drug/violence predictive group models. Second, examine the associations between mental health symptomology and predicted group models. Third, examine the associations between infectious disease risk-factors and predicted group models. This study used secondary data from a NIDAfunded grant focused on risk reduction among high-risk incarcerated women in Appalachia (N=400). All study recruitment and data collection procedures were approved by the university IRB. Predicted drugs/violence groups were developed using a series of discriminant function analyses. Predicted group models were examined for associations with mental health symptomology and risk factors for infectious disease using a series of binary logistic regression analyses. Results indicated that rural justice-involved women can be discriminated into distinct drugs/violence subgroups, and the psychopharmacological group showed the greatest prevalence. In addition, several behavioral health factors were uniquely associated with the psychopharmacological group and the economic-compulsive group. These findings could offer novel considerations for theory development regarding the drug-related risks for violence victimization among rural justice-involved women. The current research may also inform future traditional substance use treatment (e.g., outpatient or residential) and jail-based treatment (e.g., brief intervention) for rural women. Implications for theory development, substance use treatment and policy, future research, and the social work profession were discussed.",,2019.0,233,1,0,False,,,,,,841,14812452,G.

846,"Hints, neutrino bounds, and WDM constraints from SDSS DR14 Lyman-α and Planck full-survey data","The Lyman-α forest 1D flux power spectrum is a powerful probe of several cosmological parameters. Assuming a ΛCDM cosmology including massive neutrinos, we find that the latest SDSS DR14 BOSS and eBOSS Lyman-α forest data is in very good agreement with current weak lensing constraints on (Ωm, σ8) and has the same small level of tension with Planck. We did not identify a systematic effect in the data analysis that could explain this small tension, but we show that it can be reduced in extended cosmological models where the spectral index is not the same on the very different times and scales probed by CMB and Lyman-α data. A particular case is that of a ΛCDM model including a running of the spectral index on top of massive neutrinos. With combined Lyman-α and Planck data, we find a slight (3σ) preference for negative running, αs= −0.010 ± 0.004 (68%CL). Neutrino mass bounds are found to be robust against different assumptions. In the ΛCDM model with running, we find ∑ mν <0.11 eV at the 95% confidence level for combined Lyman-α and Planck (temperature and polarisation) data, or ∑ mν < 0.09 eV when adding CMB lensing and BAO data. We further provide strong and nearly model-independent bounds on the mass of thermal warm dark matter. For a conservative configuration consisting of SDSS data restricted to z<4.5 combined with XQ-100 Lyman-α data, we find mX > 5.3 keV (95%CL).",Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,2020.0,87,105,4,True,,,,,,846,1380534277,N.

857,Professional Development and Self-Efficacy: Their Impact on the Advancement of Latinas in Higher Education Leadership,"Professional Development and Self -Efficacy: Their Impact on the Advancement of Latinas in Higher Education Leadership Olga M. Torres Inglebritson Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Rachel Hershberg Purpose: Research has demonstrated that Latinas are advancing their education (Lopez & Gonzalez-Barrera, 2014), yet the number of Latinas in leadership positions at higher education institutions is not significantly increasing (Muñoz, 2010; Montas-Hunter, 2012). There are many ways in which individuals advance in their careers. For Latinas, their intersectional identities, particularly regarding their race, ethnicity, and gender, influence this process and their experiences. The personal career experiences of Latinas at higher education institutions has not fully been explored. Focusing on the Latina experiences in higher education is important for several reasons. First, to increase the number of Latinas in higher education leadership positions, we need to understand the structural and institutional barriers that may deter Latinas from seeking leadership positions. Second, understanding the experiences of Latinas who are currently in positions of leadership at higher education institutions, how they have confronted such barriers, and additional challenges they experience to advancing further in their careers will PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LATINAS 3 contribute to and expand the research in this area. Finally, this knowledge will inform how higher education institutions can support and create positive experiences for other Latinas seeking leadership positions. Method: Ten Latinas currently in higher education leadership positions were recruited to participate in semi-formal interviews about their educational and career experiences. Interviews were guided by the testimonios approach, which focuses on eliciting Latinas’ stories about their lives, in their own words (The Latina Feminist Group, 2001). A theoretical thematic analysis drawing on Latino Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) (Solórzano & Yosso, 2002) and Bandura’s Self Efficacy Theory (1994) was then applied to their narratives to explore career experiences at institutions of higher education, as well as barriers and supports they encountered during their educational and career journeys. Findings: The findings from this study indicated that although the participants were employed at different institutions throughout the Western United States, each experienced institutional barriers, and some experienced barrier within their own Latino communities as they sought to advance in their careers. Despite these challenges, all participants described the various ways in which they have successfully navigated their careers – and advanced in their careers. Themes identified in the analysis were: Barriers – institutional and community; Support throughout educational and career journeys; Intersectional identities and related influences on career advancement; Professional Developmenttraditional and nontraditional; Self-Efficacy – Affective, Motivational, and Selective Processes. Discussion and Implications: Latinas are fully capable of taking on leadership positions at higher education institutions, yet the barriers that they have to overcome sway many from PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LATINAS 4 pursuing these roles. Higher education institutions, and their students, would benefit from Latina leaders but need to support them. Learning about their cultural resources, understanding the historical oppression they have experienced, and valuing their knowledge and strengths will help retain Latinas at higher education institutions. Future research should focus on the racial climate at institutions and how it influences the career experiences of Latinas.

860,Modeling Annotator Perspective and Polarized Opinions to Improve Hate Speech Detection,"In this paper we propose an approach to exploit the fine-grained knowledge expressed by individual human annotators during a hate speech (HS) detection task, before the aggregation of single judgments in a gold standard dataset eliminates non-majority perspectives. We automatically divide the annotators into groups, aiming at grouping them by similar personal characteristics (ethnicity, social background, culture etc.). To serve a multi-lingual perspective, we performed classification experiments on three different Twitter datasets in English and Italian languages. We created different gold standards, one for each group, and trained a state-of-the-art deep learning model on them, showing that supervised models informed by different perspectives on the target phenomena outperform a baseline represented by models trained on fully aggregated data. Finally, we implemented an ensemble approach that combines the single perspective-aware classifiers into an inclusive model. The results show that this strategy further improves the classification performance, especially with a significant boost in the recall of HS prediction.",AAAI Conference on Human Computation & Crowdsourcing,2020.0,16,25,1,True,"An approach to exploit the fine-grained knowledge expressed by individual human annotators during a hate speech detection task, before the aggregation of single judgments in a gold standard dataset eliminates non-majority perspectives is proposed.",,,,,860,49181304,S.

861,Hate speech detection and racial bias mitigation in social media based on BERT model,"Disparate biases associated with datasets and trained classifiers in hateful and abusive content identification tasks have raised many concerns recently. Although the problem of biased datasets on abusive language detection has been addressed more frequently, biases arising from trained classifiers have not yet been a matter of concern. In this paper, we first introduce a transfer learning approach for hate speech detection based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and evaluate the proposed model on two publicly available datasets that have been annotated for racism, sexism, hate or offensive content on Twitter. Next, we introduce a bias alleviation mechanism to mitigate the effect of bias in training set during the fine-tuning of our pre-trained BERT-based model for hate speech detection. Toward that end, we use an existing regularization method to reweight input samples, thereby decreasing the effects of high correlated training set’ s n-grams with class labels, and then fine-tune our pre-trained BERT-based model with the new re-weighted samples. To evaluate our bias alleviation mechanism, we employed a cross-domain approach in which we use the trained classifiers on the aforementioned datasets to predict the labels of two new datasets from Twitter, AAE-aligned and White-aligned groups, which indicate tweets written in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE), respectively. The results show the existence of systematic racial bias in trained classifiers, as they tend to assign tweets written in AAE from AAE-aligned group to negative classes such as racism, sexism, hate, and offensive more often than tweets written in SAE from White-aligned group. However, the racial bias in our classifiers reduces significantly after our bias alleviation mechanism is incorporated. This work could institute the first step towards debiasing hate speech and abusive language detection systems.",PLoS ONE,2020.0,50,76,9,True,A transfer learning approach for hate speech detection based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and a bias alleviation mechanism to mitigate the effect of bias in training set during the fine-tuning of the proposed model.,Html,"[{'title': 'plos.org', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237861'}]","M Mozafari, R Farahbakhsh, N Crespi - PloS one, 2020 - journals.plos.org","[{'name': 'M Mozafari', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=46Zy1AEAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=46Zy1AEAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '46Zy1AEAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'R Farahbakhsh', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HukBnBlWTE0C&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=HukBnBlWTE0C&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'HukBnBlWTE0C'}, {'name': 'N Crespi', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z_-5wSkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=z_-5wSkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'z_-5wSkAAAAJ'}]",861,2639305,Marzieh Mozafari,2633697,R.

865,EVALITA 2020: Overview of the 7th Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian,"The Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian (EVALITA) is the biennial initiative aimed at promoting the development of language and speech technologies for the Italian language. EVALITA is promoted by the Italian Association of Computational Linguistics (AILC)1 and it is endorsed by the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence (AIxIA)2 and the Italian Association for Speech Sciences (AISV)3. EVALITA provides a shared framework where different systems and approaches can be scientifically evaluated and compared with each other with respect to a large variety of tasks, suggested and organized by the Italian research community. The proposed tasks represent scientific challenges where methods, resources, and systems can be tested against shared benchmarks representing linguistic open issues or real world applications, possibly in a multilingual and/or multi-modal perspective. The collected data sets provide big opportunities for scientists to explore old and new problems concerning NLP in Italian as well as to develop solutions and to discuss the NLP-related issues within the community. Some tasks are traditionally present in the evaluation campaign, while others are completely new. This paper introduces the tasks proposed at EVALITA 2020 and provides an overview to the participants and systems whose descriptions and obtained results are reported in these Proceedings4. The EVALITA 2020 edition, held online on December 17th due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counts 14 different tasks. In particular, the selected tasks are grouped in five research areas (tracks) according to their objective and characteristics, namely (i) Affect, Hate, and Stance, (ii) Creativity and Style, (iii) New Challenges in Long-standing Tasks, (iv) Semantics and Multimodality, (v) Time and Diachrony. This edition was highly participated, with 51 groups whose participants have affiliation in 14 countries. Although EVALITA is generally promoted and targeted to the Italian research community, this edition saw an international participation, also thanks to the fact that several Italian researchers working in different countries contributed to the organization of the tasks or participated in them as authors. This overview is organized as follows: in Section 2 a brief description of the tasks belonging to the various areas is reported. Section 3 discusses the participation to the workshop referred to several aspects, from the research area, to the affiliation of authors. Section 4 describes the criteria used to assign the best system across tasks award, made by an ad-hoc committee starting from the suggestions of task organizers and reviewers.

868,"Directions in abusive language training data, a systematic review: Garbage in, garbage out","Data-driven and machine learning based approaches for detecting, categorising and measuring abusive content such as hate speech and harassment have gained traction due to their scalability, robustness and increasingly high performance. Making effective detection systems for abusive content relies on having the right training datasets, reflecting a widely accepted mantra in computer science: Garbage In, Garbage Out. However, creating training datasets which are large, varied, theoretically-informed and that minimize biases is difficult, laborious and requires deep expertise. This paper systematically reviews 63 publicly available training datasets which have been created to train abusive language classifiers. It also reports on creation of a dedicated website for cataloguing abusive language data hatespeechdata.com. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of open science in this field, and argue that although more dataset sharing would bring many benefits it also poses social and ethical risks which need careful consideration.

872,DeL-haTE: A Deep Learning Tunable Ensemble for Hate Speech Detection,"Online hate speech on social media has become a fast-growing problem in recent times. Nefarious groups have developed large content delivery networks across several mainstream (Twitter and Facebook) and fringe outlets (Gab, 4chan, 8chan, etc.) to deliver cascades of hate messages directed both at individuals and communities. Thus addressing these issues has become a top priority for large-scale social media outlets. Three key challenges in automated detection and classification of hateful content are the lack of clearly labeled data, evolving vocabulary and lexicon - hashtags, emojis, etc - and the lack of baseline models for fringe outlets such as Gab. In this work, we propose a novel framework with three major contributions. (a) We engineer an ensemble of deep learning models that combines the strengths of state-of-the-art approaches, (b) we incorporate a tuning factor into this framework that leverages transfer learning to conduct automated hate speech classification on unlabeled datasets, like Gab, and (c) we develop a weak supervised learning methodology that allows our framework to train on unlabeled data.

In the current century, social media has created many job opportunities and, at the same time, it has become a unique place for people to freely express their opinions. Meanwhile, among these users, there are some groups that are taking advantage of this framework and misuse this freedom to implement their toxic mindset (i.e insulting, verbal sexual harassment, threads, Obscene, etc.). The 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) estimated that 14.9% of high school students were electronically bullied in the 12 months, prior to the survey. The primary result could be an Open Source model used by app developers in support of antibullying efforts. The analysis of the results showed that LSTM has a 20% higher true positive rate than well-known Näıve Bayes method and this can be a big game changer in the field of comment classification.

Typically, hate speech detection models are evaluated by measuring their performance on held-out test data using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. However, this approach makes it difficult to identify specific model weak points. It also risks overestimating generalisable model performance due to increasingly well-evidenced systematic gaps and biases in hate speech datasets. To enable more targeted diagnostic insights, we introduce HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection models. We specify 29 model functionalities motivated by a review of previous research and a series of interviews with civil society stakeholders.

877,Detect All Abuse! Toward Universal Abusive Language Detection Models,"Online abusive language detection (ALD) has become a societal issue of increasing importance in recent years. Several previous works in online ALD focused on solving a single abusive language problem in a single domain, like Twitter, and have not been successfully transferable to the general ALD task or domain. In this paper, we introduce a new generic ALD framework, MACAS, which is capable of addressing several types of ALD tasks across different domains.

878,Detecting weak and strong Islamophobic hate speech on social media,"ABSTRACT Islamophobic hate speech on social media is a growing concern in contemporary Western politics and society. It can inflict considerable harm on any victims who are targeted, create a sense of fear and exclusion amongst their communities, toxify public discourse and motivate other forms of extremist and hateful behavior. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for automated tools to detect and classify Islamophobic hate speech robustly and at scale, thereby enabling quantitative analyses of large textual datasets, such as those collected from social media. Previous research has mostly approached the automated detection of hate speech as a binary task. However, the varied nature of Islamophobia means that this is often inappropriate for both theoretically informed social science and effective monitoring of social media platforms. Drawing on in-depth conceptual work we build an automated software tool which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic, weak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content. Accuracy is 77.6% and balanced accuracy is 83%. Our tool enables future quantitative research into the drivers, spread, prevalence and effects of Islamophobic hate speech on social media.",Journal of Information Technology & Politics,2018.0,102,73,1,True,"An automated software tool which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic, weak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content, which enables future quantitative research into the drivers, spread, prevalence and effects of Islamophobic hate speech on social media.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10400'}]","B Vidgen, T Yasseri - Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 2020 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'B Vidgen', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yRhnVoIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=yRhnVoIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'yRhnVoIAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'T Yasseri', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AiLoMKwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=AiLoMKwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'AiLoMKwAAAAJ'}]",878,2737827,Bertie Vidgen,1985987,T.

879,Learning from the Worst: Dynamically Generated Datasets to Improve Online Hate Detection,"We present a human-and-model-in-the-loop process for dynamically generating datasets and training better performing and more robust hate detection models. We provide a new dataset of 40,000 entries, generated and labelled by trained annotators over four rounds of dynamic data creation. It includes 15,000 challenging perturbations and each hateful entry has fine-grained labels for the type and target of hate. Hateful entries make up 54% of the dataset, which is substantially higher than comparable datasets. We show that model performance is substantially improved using this approach. Models trained on later rounds of data collection perform better on test sets and are harder for annotators to trick. They also have better performance on HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for online hate detection.

880,The Datafication of Hate: Expectations and Challenges in Automated Hate Speech Monitoring,"Hate speech has been identified as a pressing problem in society and several automated approaches have been designed to detect and prevent it. This paper reports and reflects upon an action research setting consisting of multi-organizational collaboration conducted during Finnish municipal elections in 2017, wherein a technical infrastructure was designed to automatically monitor candidates' social media updates for hate speech. The setting allowed us to engage in a 2-fold investigation. First, the collaboration offered a unique view for exploring how hate speech emerges as a technical problem. The project developed an adequately well-working algorithmic solution using supervised machine learning. We tested the performance of various feature extraction and machine learning methods and ended up using a combination of Bag-of-Words feature extraction with Support-Vector Machines. However, an automated approach required heavy simplification, such as using rudimentary scales for classifying hate speech and a reliance on word-based approaches, while in reality hate speech is a linguistic and social phenomenon with various tones and forms. Second, the action-research-oriented setting allowed us to observe affective responses, such as the hopes, dreams, and fears related to machine learning technology. Based on participatory observations, project artifacts and documents, interviews with project participants, and online reactions to the detection project, we identified participants' aspirations for effective automation as well as the level of neutrality and objectivity introduced by an algorithmic system. However, the participants expressed more critical views toward the system after the monitoring process. Our findings highlight how the powerful expectations related to technology can easily end up dominating a project dealing with a contested, topical social issue. We conclude by discussing the problematic aspects of datafying hate and suggesting some practical implications for hate speech recognition.",Frontiers in Big Data,2020.0,100,22,1,False,"An action research setting consisting of multi-organizational collaboration conducted during Finnish municipal elections in 2017, wherein a technical infrastructure was designed to automatically monitor candidates' social media updates for hate speech, identifies participants' aspirations for effective automation as well as the level of neutrality and objectivity introduced by an algorithmic system.",,,,,880,73093771,Salla-Maaria Laaksonen,51391714,Jesse Haapoja,2253585,T.

Since raw data for AI learning are processed and inspected manually to assure high quality for sophisticated AI learning, human errors are inevitable, and damaged and incomplete data and differences from the original data may lead to unexpected outputs of AI learning for which processed data are used. In this context, this research examines cases where AI learning data were inaccurate, in terms of cybersecurity, and the need for learning data management before machine learning through analysis of cybersecurity attack techniques, and we propose the direction of establishing a data-preserving AI system, which is a blockchain-based learning data environment model to verify the integrity of learning data.

These classifiers are thus likely to have undesirable properties. For instance, they may have biases against some sub-populations or may not work effectively in the wild due to overfitting.

In light of recent work suggesting an intimate connection between fairness and robustness, we investigate whether algorithms from robust ML can be used to improve the fairness of classifiers that are trained on biased data and tested on unbiased data. We apply Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), a domain generalization algorithm that employs a causal discovery inspired method to find robust predictors, to the task of fairly predicting the toxicity of internet comments. We show that IRM achieves better out-of-distribution accuracy and fairness than Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) methods, and analyze both the difficulties that arise when applying IRM in practice and the conditions under which IRM will likely be effective in this scenario.

890,Overview of the HASOC Subtrack at FIRE 2022: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in English and Indo-Aryan Languages,"In recent years, the spread of online offensive content has become of great concern, motivating researchers to develop robust systems capable of identifying such content automatically. To carry out a fair evaluation of these systems, several international shared tasks have been organized, providing the community with essential benchmark data and evaluation methods for various languages. Organized since 2019, the HASOC (Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification) shared task is one of these initiatives. In its fourth iteration, HASOC 2022 included three tasks for English-Hindi codemix, German and Marathi. Tasks 1 and 2 were on conversational hate speech detection. The idea is to detect supporting hate speech, profanity, or other forms of offensiveness depending on the surrounding context of Twitter posts. Task 1 was offered in Hindi-English codemix and German.

891,Dependency-Based Embedding for Distinguishing Between Hate Speech and Offensive Language,"The task of detecting online textual hate speech focuses on various objectives with one of the most important being distinguishing between hate speech and generic offensive language. This distinction is very blurry since the two classes are strongly overlapped. Using only keywords for identification falls short because of this overlap, hence the context in which each textual instance exists in, needs to be extracted for increased effectiveness. To achieve this, we investigate the use of embeddings learned with syntactic dependency context (words that have a grammatical relationship with the target word) as opposed to linear context (words that precede and succeed the target word as determined by the window size) in various forms as features for the classification task on a multi-class dataset. Our results and analysis show that for the downstream task of hate speech detection, specifically for distinguishing between hateful and offensive language, the dependency-based embedding has a very comparable performance with its linear-based counterpart even outperforming it in some settings. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art (BERT), it demonstrates competitive performance especially when in an ensemble with linear-based embedding. Also, we observed that for a specialised task such as hate speech detection, a domain-specific embedding is probably more important than a large out-of-domain embedding with a larger vocabulary size.",2020 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT),2020.0,26,1,0,False,"This work investigates the use of embeddings learned with syntactic dependency context as opposed to linear context in various forms as features for the classification task on a multi-class dataset and shows that for the downstream task of hate speech detection, the dependency-based embedding has a very comparable performance with its linear-based counterpart even outperforming it in some settings.",,,"KJ Madukwe, X Gao, B Xue - 2020 IEEE/WIC/ACM International …, 2020 - ieeexplore.ieee.org","[{'name': 'KJ Madukwe', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nnFAVaUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=nnFAVaUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'nnFAVaUAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'X Gao', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6uZY9GIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=6uZY9GIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '6uZY9GIAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'B Xue', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RILgdb4AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=RILgdb4AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'RILgdb4AAAAJ'}]",891,35524405,K.

NLP models can inadvertently learn socially undesirable patterns when training on gender biased text. In this work, we propose a general framework that decomposes gender bias in text along several pragmatic and semantic dimensions: bias from the gender of the person being spoken about, bias from the gender of the person being spoken to, and bias from the gender of the speaker. Using this fine-grained framework, we automatically annotate eight large scale datasets with gender information. In addition, we collect a novel, crowdsourced evaluation benchmark of utterance-level gender rewrites. Distinguishing between gender bias along multiple dimensions is important, as it enables us to train finer-grained gender bias classifiers.

894,RealToxicityPrompts: Evaluating Neural Toxic Degeneration in Language Models,"Pretrained neural language models (LMs) are prone to generating racist, sexist, or otherwise toxic language which hinders their safe deployment. We investigate the extent to which pretrained LMs can be prompted to generate toxic language, and the effectiveness of controllable text generation algorithms at preventing such toxic degeneration. We create and release RealToxicityPrompts, a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. Using RealToxicityPrompts, we find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We empirically assess several controllable generation methods, and find that while data- or compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g., banning “bad” words), no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et. al, 2019), and find a significant amount of offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic content. Our work provides a test bed for evaluating toxic generations by LMs and stresses the need for better data selection processes for pretraining.",Findings,2020.0,87,277,68,True,"It is found that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts, and empirically assess several controllable generation methods find that while data- or compute-intensive methods are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions, no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration.",,,,,894,1962694751,Samuel Gehman,40895369,Suchin Gururangan,2729164,Maarten Sap,1699545,Yejin Choi,144365875,Noah A.

898,Bias Preservation in Machine Learning: The Legality of Fairness Metrics Under EU Non-Discrimination Law,"Western societies are marked by diverse and extensive biases and inequality that are unavoidably embedded in the data used to train machine learning. Algorithms trained on biased data will, without intervention, produce biased outcomes and increase the inequality experienced by historically disadvantaged groups. Recognising this problem, much work has emerged in recent years to test for bias in machine learning and AI systems using various fairness and bias metrics. Often these metrics address technical bias but ignore the underlying causes of inequality. In this paper we make three contributions. First, we assess the compatibility of fairness metrics used in machine learning against the aims and purpose of EU non-discrimination law. We show that the fundamental aim of the law is not only to prevent ongoing discrimination, but also to change society, policies, and practices to ‘level the playing field’ and achieve substantive rather than merely formal equality. Based on this, we then propose a novel classification scheme for fairness metrics in machine learning based on how they handle pre-existing bias and thus align with the aims of non-discrimination law. Specifically, we distinguish between ‘bias preserving’ and ‘bias transforming’ fairness metrics. Our classification system is intended to bridge the gap between non-discrimination law and decisions around how to measure fairness in machine learning and AI in practice. Finally, we show that the legal need for justification in cases of indirect discrimination can impose additional obligations on developers, deployers, and users that choose to use bias preserving fairness metrics when making decisions about individuals because they can give rise to prima facie discrimination. To achieve substantive equality in practice, and thus meet the aims of the law, we instead recommend using bias transforming metrics. To conclude, we provide concrete recommendations including a user-friendly checklist for choosing the most appropriate fairness metric for uses of machine learning and AI under EU non-discrimination law.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2021.0,35,53,8,True,A novel classification scheme for fairness metrics in machine learning is proposed based on how they handle pre-existing bias and thus align with the aims of non-discrimination law and provides concrete recommendations including a user-friendly checklist for choosing the most appropriate fairness metric for uses of machine learning and AI under EU non- discrimination law.,,,,,898,12806133,Sandra Wachter,3127701,B.

901,A Framework for Detecting Intentions of Criminal Acts in Social Media: A Case Study on Twitter,"Criminals use online social networks for various activities by including communication, planning, and execution of criminal acts. They often employ ciphered posts using slang expressions, which are restricted to specific groups. Although literature shows advances in analysis of posts in natural language messages, such as hate discourses, threats, and more notably in the sentiment analysis; research enabling intention analysis of posts using slang expressions is still underexplored. We propose a framework and construct software prototypes for the selection of social network posts with criminal slang expressions and automatic classification of these posts according to illocutionary classes. The developed framework explores computational ontologies and machine learning (ML) techniques. Our defined Ontology of Criminal Expressions represents crime concepts in a formal and flexible model, and associates them with criminal slang expressions. This ontology is used for selecting suspicious posts and decipher them. In our solution, the criminal intention in written posts is automatically classified relying on learned models from existing posts. This work carries out a case study to evaluate the framework with 8,835,290 tweets.

903,Expectations of artificial intelligence and the performativity of ethics: Implications for communication governance,"This article draws on the sociology of expectations to examine the construction of expectations of ‘ethical AI’ and considers the implications of these expectations for communication governance. We first analyse a range of public documents to identify the key actors, mechanisms and issues which structure societal expectations around artificial intelligence (AI) and an emerging discourse on ethics. We then explore expectations of AI and ethics through a survey of members of the public. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the role of AI in communication governance. We find that, despite societal expectations that we can design ethical AI, and public expectations that developers and governments should share responsibility for the outcomes of AI use, there is a significant divergence between these expectations and the ways in which AI technologies are currently used and governed in large scale communication systems. We conclude that discourses of ‘ethical AI’ are generically performative, but to become more effective we need to acknowledge the limitations of contemporary AI and the requirement for extensive human labour to meet the challenges of communication governance. An effective ethics of AI requires domain appropriate AI tools, updated professional practices, dignified places of work and robust regulatory and accountability frameworks.",Big Data & Society,2020.0,49,37,1,True,,,"[{'title': 'sagepub.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951720915939'}]","A Kerr, M Barry, JD Kelleher - Big Data & Society, 2020 - journals.sagepub.com","[{'name': 'A Kerr', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Uop6uoAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=3Uop6uoAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '3Uop6uoAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Barry', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HMclLucAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=HMclLucAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'HMclLucAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'JD Kelleher', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FUPHHYAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=4FUPHHYAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '4FUPHHYAAAAJ'}]",903,36029688,Aphra Kerr,34810113,Marguerite Barry,34967075,John D.

904,On the Social and Technical Challenges of Web Search Autosuggestion Moderation,"Past research shows that users benefit from systems that support them in their writing and exploration tasks. The autosuggestion feature of Web search engines is an example of such a system: It helps users formulate their queries by offering a list of suggestions as they type. Such autosuggestions are typically generated by machine learning (ML) systems trained on a corpus of search logs and document representations. These automated methods can however become prone to issues that might result in the system making problematic suggestions that are biased, racist, sexist or in other ways inappropriate. While current search engines have become increasingly proficient at suppressing many types of problematic suggestions, there are still persistent issues that remain. In this paper, we reflect on past efforts and on why certain issues still linger by covering explored solutions along a prototypical pipeline for identifying, detecting, and mitigating problematic autosuggestions. To showcase their complexity, we discuss several dimensions of problematic suggestions, difficult issues along the pipeline, and why our discussion applies to an increasing number of applications (beyond Web search) that implement similar textual suggestion features. By outlining several persistent social and technical challenges in moderating Web search suggestions, we hope to provide a renewed call for action.",First Monday,2020.0,87,3,1,False,"This paper reflects on past efforts and on why certain issues still linger in moderating Web search suggestions by covering explored solutions along a prototypical pipeline for identifying, detecting, and mitigating problematic autosuggestions.",,,,,904,1798550,Timothy J.

905,Balancing Fairness and Accuracy in Sentiment Detection using Multiple Black Box Models,"Sentiment detection is an important building block for multiple information retrieval tasks such as product recommendation, cyberbullying, fake news and misinformation detection. Unsurprisingly, multiple commercial APIs, each with different levels of accuracy and fairness, are now publicly available for sentiment detection. Users can easily incorporate these APIs in their applications. While combining inputs from multiple modalities or black-box models for increasing accuracy is commonly studied in multimedia computing literature, there has been little work on combining different modalities for increasingfairness of the resulting decision. In this work, we audit multiple commercial sentiment detection APIs for the gender bias in two-actor news headlines settings and report on the level of bias observed. Next, we propose a ""Flexible Fair Regression"" approach, which ensures satisfactory accuracy and fairness by jointly learning from multiple black-box models. The results pave way for fair yet accurate sentiment detectors for multiple applications.","Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics in Multimedia",2020.0,43,2,0,True,"This work audits multiple commercial sentiment detection APIs for the gender bias in two-actor news headlines settings and proposes a ""Flexible Fair Regression"" approach, which ensures satisfactory accuracy and fairness by jointly learning from multiple black-box models.",,,,,905,123693804,Abdulaziz A.

906,Reader comment analysis on online news platforms,"Comment sections of online news platforms are an essential space to express opinions and discuss political topics. However, the misuse by spammers, haters, and trolls raises doubts about whether the benefits justify the costs of the time-consuming content moderation. As a consequence, many platforms limited or even shut down comment sections completely. In this thesis, we present deep learning approaches for comment classification, recommendation, and prediction to foster respectful and engaging online discussions. The main focus is on two kinds of comments: toxic comments, which make readers leave a discussion, and engaging comments, which make readers join a discussion. First, we discourage and remove toxic comments, e.g., insults or threats. To this end, we present a semi-automatic comment moderation process, which is based on fine-grained text classification models and supports moderators. Our experiments demonstrate that data augmentation, transfer learning, and ensemble learning allow training robust classifiers even on small datasets. To establish trust in the machine-learned models, we reveal which input features are decisive for their output with attribution-based explanation methods. Second, we encourage and highlight engaging comments, e.g., serious questions or factual statements. We automatically identify the most engaging comments, so that readers need not scroll through thousands of comments to find them. The model training process builds on upvotes and replies as a measure of reader engagement. We also identify comments that address the article authors or are otherwise relevant to them to support interactions between journalists and their readership. Taking into account the readers' interests, we further provide personalized recommendations of discussions that align with their favored topics or involve frequent co-commenters. Our models outperform multiple baselines and recent related work in experiments on comment datasets from different platforms.",,2020.0,0,1,0,False,"A semi-automatic comment moderation process, which is based on fine-grained text classification models and supports moderators and automatically identifies the most engaging comments, so that readers need not scroll through thousands of comments to find them.",,"[{'title': 'uni-potsdam.de', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/files/48922/risch_diss.pdf'}]",J Risch - 2020 - publishup.uni-potsdam.de,"[{'name': 'J Risch', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sBjOp_YAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=sBjOp_YAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'sBjOp_YAAAAJ'}]",906,1695993,Julian Risch,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,
907,"Whose side are ethics codes on?: power, responsibility and the social good","The moral authority of ethics codes stems from an assumption that they serve a unified society, yet this ignores the political aspects of any shared resource. The sociologist Howard S. Becker challenged researchers to clarify their power and responsibility in the classic essay: Whose Side Are We On. Building on Becker's hierarchy of credibility, we report on a critical discourse analysis of data ethics codes and emerging conceptualizations of beneficence, or the ""social good"", of data technology. The analysis revealed that ethics codes from corporations and professional associations conflated consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. Interviews with community organizers about social change in the digital era supplement the analysis, surfacing the limits of technical solutions to concerns of marginalized communities. Given evidence that highlights the gulf between the documents and lived experiences, we argue that ethics codes that elevate consumers may simultaneously subordinate the needs of vulnerable populations. Understanding contested digital resources is central to the emerging field of public interest technology.

908,Governing Artificial Intelligence to benefit the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"Big Tech's unregulated roll-out out of experimental AI poses risks to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particular vulnerability for developing countries. The goal of financial inclusion is threatened by the imperfect and ungoverned design and implementation of AI decision-making software making important financial decisions affecting customers. Automated decision-making algorithms have displayed evidence of bias, lack ethical governance, and limit transparency in the basis for their decisions, causing unfair outcomes and amplify unequal access to finance. Poverty reduction and sustainable development targets are risked by Big Tech's potential exploitation of developing countries by using AI to harvest data and profits. Stakeholder progress toward preventing financial crime and corruption is further threatened by potential misuse of AI. In the light of such risks, Big Tech's unscrupulous history means it cannot be trusted to operate without regulatory oversight. The article proposes effective pre-emptive regulatory options to minimize scenarios of AI damaging the SDGs. It explores internationally accepted principles of AI governance, and argues for their implementation as regulatory requirements governing AI developers and coders, with compliance verified through algorithmic auditing. Furthermore, it argues that AI governance frameworks must require a benefit to the SDGs. The article argues that proactively predicting such problems can enable continued AI innovation through well-designed regulations adhering to international principles. It highlights risks of unregulated AI causing harm to human interests, where a public and regulatory backlash may result in over-regulation that could damage the otherwise beneficial development of AI.",,2020.0,79,38,3,False,,,,,,908,82091862,J.

910,"Developing Future Human-Centered Smart Cities: Critical Analysis of Smart City Security, Interpretability, and Ethical Challenges","As we make tremendous advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence technosciences, there is a renewed understanding in the AI community that we must ensure that humans being are at the center of our deliberations so that we don't end in technology-induced dystopias. As strongly argued by Green in his book Smart Enough City, the incorporation of technology in city environs does not automatically translate into prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice. There is a great need to deliberate on the future of the cities worth living and designing. There are philosophical and ethical questions involved along with various challenges that relate to the security, safety, and interpretability of AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities. Several research institutes on human centered AI have been established at top international universities. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-compatible. For example, Stuart Russell has a book called Human Compatible AI. The Center for Humane Technology advocates for regulators and technology companies to avoid business models and product features that contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical challenges to a successful deployment of AI or ML in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges.

911,The Three Harms of Gendered Technology,"Marginalised groups experience both immediate and long-term detriment as a result of innovations in information systems. This paper explores three facets of technologically related gendered harm: physical, institutional, and psychological. These harms will be demonstrated by case studies. Firstly, technology can cause physical harm by denying women their bodily autonomy, demonstrated by the public availability of AI software that generates nude pictures of women, and smart home devices used in instances of domestic abuse. Secondly, technology can deny women institutional access, as increasingly widespread algorithms are shown to underperform on marginalised groups. Thirdly, anthropomorphised technology reflects and entrenches harmful stereotypes of women’s submissiveness, causing psychological harm. Reducing harm must go beyond ensuring a diversity of representation in STEM fields. We conclude that effective regulation should focus on the design features in technological innovations.",Australasian Journal of Information Systems,2020.0,38,5,2,True,"It is concluded that effective regulation should focus on the design features in technological innovations, which reflect and entrenches harmful stereotypes of women’s submissiveness, causing psychological harm.",,,,,911,2108526962,Lena Wang,,,,,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Sociology",JournalArticle

Opponents argue that the irresponsible design and use of facial detection and recognition technologies (FDRTs) threatens to violate civil liberties, infringe on basic human rights and further entrench structural racism and systemic marginalisation. They also caution that the gradual creep of face surveillance infrastructures into every domain of lived experience may eventually eradicate the modern democratic forms of life that have long provided cherished means to individual flourishing, social solidarity and human self-creation. Defenders, by contrast, emphasise the gains in public safety, security and efficiency that digitally streamlined capacities for facial identification, identity verification and trait characterisation may bring. In this explainer, I focus on one central aspect of this debate: the role that dynamics of bias and discrimination play in the development and deployment of FDRTs. I examine how historical patterns of discrimination have made inroads into the design and implementation of FDRTs from their very earliest moments. And, I explain the ways in which the use of biased FDRTs can lead distributional and recognitional injustices. The explainer concludes with an exploration of broader ethical questions around the potential proliferation of pervasive face-based surveillance infrastructures and makes some recommendations for cultivating more responsible approaches to the development and governance of these technologies.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2020.0,104,13,0,True,This explainer examines how historical patterns of discrimination have made inroads into the design and implementation of FDRTs from their very earliest moments and explains the ways in which the use of biased FDRTs can lead distributional and recognitional injustices.,,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07023'}]","D Leslie - arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.07023, 2020 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'D Leslie', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3V9AG1sAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=3V9AG1sAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '3V9AG1sAAAAJ'}]",915,2061666356,David Leslie,,,,,,,,,,,"Political Science, Computer Science",JournalArticle

918,Learning From Multiple Expert Annotators for Enhancing Anomaly Detection in Medical Image Analysis,"Recent years have experienced phenomenal growth in computer-aided diagnosis systems based on machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection tasks in the medical image domain. However, the performance of these algorithms greatly depends on the quality of labels since the subjectivity of a single annotator might decline the certainty of medical image datasets. In order to alleviate this problem, aggregating labels from multiple radiologists with different levels of expertise has been established. In particular, under the reliance on their own biases and proficiency levels, different qualified experts provide their estimations of the “true” bounding boxes representing the anomaly observations. Learning from these nonstandard labels exerts negative effects on the performance of machine learning networks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for the enhancement of neural networks’ efficiency in abnormal detection tasks by estimating the actually hidden labels from multiple ones. A re-weighted loss function is also used to improve the detection capacity of the networks. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed approach on both simulated and real-world medical imaging datasets, MED-MNIST and VinDr-CXR. The experimental results show that our approach is able to capture the reliability of different annotators and outperform relevant baselines that do not consider the disagreements among annotators.

919,"Analyzing Genetic Testing Discourse on the Web Through the Lens of Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan","Recent progress in genomics has enabled the emergence of a flourishing market for direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing. Companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA provide affordable health, genealogy, and ancestry reports, and have already tested tens of millions of customers. Consequently, news, experiences, and views on genetic testing are increasingly shared and discussed on social media. At the same time, far-right groups have also taken an interest in genetic testing, using them to attack minorities and prove their genetic “purity.” In this article, we set to study the genetic testing discourse on a number of mainstream and fringe Web communities. We do so in two steps. First, we conduct an exploratory, large-scale analysis of the genetic testing discourse on a mainstream social network such as Twitter. We find that the genetic testing discourse is fueled by accounts that appear to be interested in digital health and technology. However, we also identify tweets with highly racist connotations. This motivates us to explore the connection between genetic testing and racism on platforms with a reputation for toxicity, namely, Reddit and 4chan, where we find that discussions around genetic testing often include highly toxic language expressed through hateful and racist comments. In particular, on 4chan’s politically incorrect board (/pol/), content from genetic testing conversations involves several alt-right personalities and openly anti-semitic rhetoric, often conveyed through memes.",ACM Transactions on the Web,2020.0,103,11,1,True,"The connection between genetic testing and racism is explored on platforms with a reputation for toxicity, namely, Reddit and 4chan, where it is found that discussions around genetic testing often include highly toxic language expressed through hateful and racist comments.",,,,,919,30450280,Alexandros Mittos,3447293,Savvas Zannettou,144728530,J.

920,Quantifying 60 Years of Gender Bias in Biomedical Research with Word Embeddings,"Gender bias in biomedical research can have an adverse impact on the health of real people. For example, there is evidence that heart disease-related funded research generally focuses on men. Health disparities can form between men and at-risk groups of women (i.e., elderly and low-income) if there is not an equal number of heart disease-related studies for both genders. In this paper, we study temporal bias in biomedical research articles by measuring gender differences in word embeddings. Specifically, we address multiple questions, including, How has gender bias changed over time in biomedical research, and what health-related concepts are the most biased? Overall, we find that traditional gender stereotypes have reduced over time. However, we also find that the embeddings of many medical conditions are as biased today as they were 60 years ago (e.g., concepts related to drug addiction and body dysmorphia).",Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing,2020.0,51,11,0,True,"Overall, it is found that traditional gender stereotypes have reduced over time in biomedical research, but the embeddings of many medical conditions are as biased today as they were 60 years ago.",,,,,920,26355137,Anthony Rios,1768302321,Reenam Joshi,115083925,Hejin Shin,,,,,,,"Psychology, Computer Science",JournalArticle

Yet, the extent of the problem and patterns of abuse remain relatively under-researched. So far, much of coverage of the problem is anecdotal or based on self-reporting from MPs. This research sets out to provide a more rigorous benchmark measure of abuse. It also examines targets and triggers for social media abuse – how far is abuse connected to contentious debates such as Brexit or targeted at specific groups of MPs (e.g. female representatives)? Our results indicate that whilst the overall volume of abuse appears low, social media abuse has become ubiquitous and is highly public.

An exception is the randomized controlled trial of Green Dot, found effective in reducing violence rates and violence acceptance in 26 high-schools (2010–2014). In ‘Life’s Snapshot’, 10,727 seniors were recruited from these same schools with the goal of determining the longer-term efficacy of bystander training. Students in intervention schools could have up to three years of Green Dot exposure. Seniors from intervention versus control schools had significantly lower scores (p <.01) indicating less violence acceptance or sexism for two of five measures. Seniors’ self-reports of bystander training received confirmed these findings. These cross-sectional analyses suggest that some reductions in violence acceptance associated with bystander programming may be maintained into early adulthood.",,2020.0,43,5,0,False,Cross-sectional analyses suggest that some reductions in violence acceptance associated with bystander programming may be maintained into early adulthood.,,,,,925,4106031,A.

926,Child Sexual Abuse Myth Scale: Validity and Reliability Evidence in the Portuguese Context,"ABSTRACT Child sexual abuse myths legitimize abusive behaviors, involving high levels of victim blame and low levels of offender liability. The present study aims to: (i) adapt a measure of endorsement of child sexual abuse myths to the Portuguese context (i.e., Child Sexual Abuse Myth Scale – CSAMS); and (ii) provide validity and reliability evidence for this measure. A total of 423 adults (66.2% female) filled out a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and the CSAMS. The CSAMS validity and reliability results supported the original structure, which comprises three dimensions: Blame Diffusion (e.g., ‘Adolescent girls who wear very revealing clothing are asking to be sexually abused’), Restrictive Stereotypes (e.g., ‘Most children are sexually abused by strangers or by men who are not well known to the child’), and Denial of Abusiveness (e.g., ‘Older children, who have a better understanding of sexual matters, have a responsibility to actively resist sexual advances by adults’). Configural and metric invariance by sex were held, and criterion validity was observed through significant associations between myths, sexism and sex.

927,Perception of Dating Violence in Teenage Couples: A Cross Validation Study in Spain and Colombia,"Background: dating violence, or violence in teenage couples, is a socially interesting topic, due to its prevalence and its possible use in predicting violence in adult couples. The perception of violence, or the detection of abusive behaviors by teenagers and young people (which can be considered as equivalent concepts), is essential to prevent violence itself. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to determine which behaviors are identified as abusive by teenagers and young people, and the severity that they attribute to them—meaning how they perceive them. Moreover, we will be able to determine whether there are differences between boys and girls in two countries: Spain and Colombia. Methods: for this study, we used two samples from both countries, with a total of 389 teenagers (50.9% females and 49.1% males) who were, on average, 16.56 years old (SD = 1.94 years). We analyzed the factorial invariance depending on sex and country of the sample and the different profiles of violence perception. Results: we found evidence of the internal validity of the questionnaire for what concerns the perception of inter-partner violence. The results point out that the perception of violence in the relationship is composed of two factors related to each other (Multiple and Emotional Abuse), which are invariant depending of sex and country of origin of the sample. The internal consistency of the test is adequate (>0.90). The analysis of the violence perception profiles indicates that Spanish teenagers have a higher perception of it, and, also, that girls hold a higher perception than boys. Conclusions: the results of this research have shown how dating violence (or violence in teenage couples) is differentially perceived not only between genders, but also across cultural contexts. Moreover, these outcomes may enhance the development of possible evidence-based interventions approaching the social problem generated by violence in teenage couples.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2020.0,62,5,0,True,"How dating violence is differentially perceived not only between genders, but also across cultural contexts is shown, which may enhance the development of possible evidence-based interventions approaching the social problem generated by violence in teenage couples.",,,,,927,1960186143,Ana Martínez-Dorado,5824231,J.

She argues that the invasion of personal and private space that documentary VR titles ‘for good’ create is a spurious or ‘toxic empathy’ that enables white viewers to feel that they have experienced authentic empathy for these others, and this digitally mediated compassion is problematically represented in multiple media texts as itself a form of political activism.",,2020.0,54,32,3,False,,,,,,929,89364752,Lisa Nakamura,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,JournalArticle
930,The Psychology of Nonconsensual Porn: Understanding and Addressing a Growing Form of Sexual Violence,"As of 2020, legal protections for victims of image-based sexual abuse in the United States remain inadequate. For example, no federal law yet criminalizes the sharing of sexually intimate material without a person’s consent (i.e., nonconsensual porn), and existing state laws are patchy and problematic. Part of the reason for this problem may be that U.S. lawmakers and the general public have yet to grasp that nonconsensual porn is a form of sexual abuse, with many of the same devastating, recurring, and lifelong consequences for victims. This review of psychological research on nonconsensual porn includes frameworks for understating this image-based sexual abuse, correlates and consequences of victimization, victim blame, and the nature of perpetration.

931,Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective,"The article presents a critical analysis of the theories and practices of scientific objectivity and outlines a promising feminist concept of objectivity. The author begins by criticizing two mainstream approaches to a feminist evaluation of scientific objectivity: a social constructionism combining the techniques of semiology and deconstruction, and a feminist empiricism. The former insists on the rhetorical nature of truth existing in the power field of a textualized world, while the latter legitimizes scientific objectivity adjusted for the results of gender analysis to yield a “successor science.” Rehabilitating the metaphor of vision resolves the dichotomy between the historical contingency of knowledge claims and subjects and the trust in scientific explanations of the “real” world. Any vision is embodied and therefore presupposes a location in the world. Consequently, the objectivity sought is inevitably embodied, and knowledge is situated and local, always associated with some place or position.
Haraway subscribes to the constructivist critique of disembodied scientific objectivity and adds that it is an example of the “god trick” in which objectivity is a view “from above” or “from nowhere,” from outside the field of particular positions so that the scientist is distanced from the object of research. The point of view — of a human, any living being, or a machine — is an allegory for feminist objectivity. But in contrast to positioning approaches, the objectivity promised does not consist in identification with another position, but rather in a partial connection: to see together with the other, without claiming to be other. Situated knowledge from a partial perspective does not monopolize the truth by ontologizing subjugation but instead opens a way to learn how others see. Thus, only a partial perspective combined with others of the same kind can guarantee objectivity and accountability. However, the shared conversation on which rational knowledge is based should not be limited only to human beings. Any object of knowledge, Haraway argues, even when mediated by technologies for visualization, has agency, is active and is a generative node for meaning. The idea of material-semiotic actors whose boundaries are materialized in social interactions is introduced to conceptualize this kind of agency.",Philosophical Literary Journal Logos,2022.0,19,7901,459,False,,,,,,931,2131300930,Donna Harawy,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

Given a changing gendered landscape in which men's identity constructions and configurations of masculinity are disrupted and challenged, some men have begun organizing online using platforms like Reddit to support and provide strategies for reasserting and reconstructing traditional forms of masculinity. Although these spaces are becoming increasingly popular, scholarship is nascent in deeply understanding how these spaces influence identity reconstruction. This paper argues that resilience processes may be a key logic in explaining how men's identity constructions occur and why men's rights communities are flourishing online. Through text mining and semantic network analysis of 35,643 comments, identity constructions vis–à–vis resilience processes were found to be fostered through contradictory logics surrounding sexual activity. These findings contribute to an alternative form of communicative resilience and provide a possible explanation and understanding of how men's rights communities persist online.",,2020.0,89,10,1,False,,,,,,932,82206278,Sean M.

933,Critique and Contribute: A Practice-Based Framework for Improving Critical Data Studies and Data Science,"Abstract What would data science look like if its key critics were engaged to help improve it, and how might critiques of data science improve with an approach that considers the day-to-day practices of data science? This article argues for scholars to bridge the conversations that seek to critique data science and those that seek to advance data science practice to identify and create the social and organizational arrangements necessary for a more ethical data science. We summarize four critiques that are commonly made in critical data studies: data are inherently interpretive, data are inextricable from context, data are mediated through the sociomaterial arrangements that produce them, and data serve as a medium for the negotiation and communication of values. We present qualitative research with academic data scientists, “data for good” projects, and specialized cross-disciplinary engineering teams to show evidence of these critiques in the day-to-day experience of data scientists as they acknowledge and grapple with the complexities of their work. Using ethnographic vignettes from two large multiresearcher field sites, we develop a set of concepts for analyzing and advancing the practice of data science and improving critical data studies, including (1) communication is central to the data science endeavor; (2) making sense of data is a collective process; (3) data are starting, not end points, and (4) data are sets of stories. We conclude with two calls to action for researchers and practitioners in data science and critical data studies alike. First, creating opportunities for bringing social scientific and humanistic expertise into data science practice simultaneously will advance both data science and critical data studies. Second, practitioners should leverage the insights from critical data studies to build new kinds of organizational arrangements, which we argue will help advance a more ethical data science. Engaging the insights of critical data studies will improve data science. Careful attention to the practices of data science will improve scholarly critiques.

935,Five Privacy Principles (from the GDPR) the United States Should Adopt to Advance Economic Justice,"Algorithmic profiling technologies are impeding the economic security of low-income people in the United States. Based on their digital profiles, low- income people are targeted for predatory marketing campaigns and financial products. At the same time, algorithmic decision-making can result in their exclusion from mainstream employment, housing, financial, health care, and educational opportunities. Government agencies are turning to algorithms to apportion social services, yet these algorithms lack transparency, leaving thousands of people adrift without state support and not knowing why. Marginalized communities are also subject to disproportionately high levels of surveillance, including facial recognition technology and the use of predictive policing software.<br><br>American privacy law is no bulwark against these profiling harms, instead placing the onus of protecting personal data on individuals while leaving government and businesses largely free to collect, analyze, share, and sell personal data. By contrast, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives EU residents numerous, enforceable rights to control their personal data. Spurred in part by the GDPR, Congress is debating whether to adopt comprehensive privacy legislation in the United States. This article contends that the GDPR contains several provisions that have the potential to limit digital discrimination against the poor, while enhancing their economic stability and mobility.

Thus, this qualitative study explores anti-racist discourses fostered by black Brazilian women on social media. Employing critical discourse analysis in a selection of publicly available Facebook posts, the study reveals that narratives praising an Afro hairstyle embody a relevant political positioning resisting Brazil’s deep-seated gendered racism.

944,Harm inflation: Making sense of concept creep,"ABSTRACT “Concept creep” is the gradual semantic expansion of harm-related concepts such as bullying, mental disorder, prejudice, and trauma. This review presents a synopsis of relevant theoretical advances and empirical research findings on the phenomenon. It addresses three fundamental questions. First, it clarifies the characterisation of concept creep by refining its theoretical and historical dimensions and presenting studies investigating the change in harm-related concepts using computational linguistics. Second, it examines factors that have caused concept creep, including cultural shifts in sensitivity to harm, societal changes in the prevalence of harm, and intentional meaning changes engineered for political ends. Third, the paper develops an account of the consequences of concept creep, including social conflict, political polarisation, speech restrictions, victim identities, and progressive social change. This extended analysis of concept creep helps to understand its mixed implications and sets a multi-pronged agenda for future research on the topic.",European Review of Social Psychology,2020.0,73,22,1,False,,,,"N Haslam, BC Dakin, F Fabiano… - European Review of …, 2020 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'N Haslam', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GvmIg10AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=GvmIg10AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'GvmIg10AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'BC Dakin', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tOtkd5cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=tOtkd5cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'tOtkd5cAAAAJ'}]",944,3041938,N.

948,Welcome to Gab Alt Right Discourses,"Social media has become an important venue for diverse groups to share information, discuss political issues, and organize social movements. Recent scholarship has shown that the social media ecosystem can affect political thinking and expression. Individuals and groups across the political spectrum have engaged in the use of these platforms extensively, even creating their own forums with varying approaches to content moderation in pursuit of freer standards of speech. The Gab social media platform arose in this context. Gab is a social media platform for the so-called alt right, and much of the popular press has opined about the thematic content of discourses on Gab and platforms like it, but little research has examined the content itself. Using a publicly available dataset of all Gab posts from August 2016 until July 2019, the current paper explores a five percent random sample of this dataset to explore thematic content on the platform. We run multiple structural topic models, using standard procedures to arrive at an optimal k number of topics. The final model specifies 85 topics for 403,469 documents. We include as prevalence variables whether the source account has been flagged as a bot and the number of followers for the source account.

However, despite its potential to perpetuate gender stereotypes, the overrepresentation of women in media has received inadequate attention. This study explores how traditional news media and social media overrepresent females as drivers when discussing traffic accidents, and whether social media could be the ‘new equalizer’ for gender. Focusing on China, we collected 97,120 posts from Weibo, China’s largest microblogging site, and 11,290 newspaper articles dated between January 2010 and November 2018. We analyzed the data through a mixed-methods design and found that female drivers are overrepresented in discussions of traffic accidents, in both newspapers and on Weibo. While the gender bias against female drivers is more prevalent on Weibo than in newspapers, Weibo has provided a platform for gender-aware discussion. Our study closes by offering suggestions for cross-platform and cross-cultural comparisons of gender representation in the digital age.",,2020.0,102,7,0,False,,,,,,949,2112144346,Muyang Li,103461220,Zhifan Luo,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

Boys were therefore more likely to use avoidance responses, whereas girls confronting and help-seeking responses. Likewise, hierarchical regressions suggest that girls and boys and girls whose parents had a high educational level and were without sexist attitudes about women’s higher level of competence in biology and languages were more likely to deploy confronting responses. Similarly, participants who did not embrace stereotypes about boys’ and girls’ higher abilities in some domains were more likely to seek help. Furthermore, boys and girls who believed that girls are better at biology and languages were more likely to develop avoidance responses. Interaction between gender and parental educational level shows that boys with highly educated parents were more likely to avoid the sexism. The present research contributes to the study of factors shaping gender differences in students’ coping with academic sexism. The role played by students’ adherence to stereotyped beliefs about boys’ and girls’ academic abilities is also discussed.",,2020.0,43,5,2,False,,,,,,950,143945038,M. Sáinz,145297402,J.

Abstract Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can provide inner loop feedback about steps within tasks, and outer loop feedback about performance on multiple tasks. While research typically addresses these feedback types separately, many ITSs offer them simultaneously. This study evaluates the effects of providing combined inner and outer loop feedback on social sciences students' learning process and performance in a first-year university statistics course. In a 2 x 2 factorial design (elaborate inner loop vs. minimal inner loop and outer loop vs. no outer loop feedback) with 521 participants, the effects of both feedback types and their combination were assessed through multiple linear regression models. Results showed mixed effects, depending on students' prior knowledge and experience, and no overall effects on course performance. Students tended to use outer loop feedback less when also receiving elaborate inner loop feedback. We therefore recommend introducing feedback types one by one and offering them for substantial periods of time.",Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,2020.0,40,5,0,True,"Results showed mixed effects, depending on students' prior knowledge and experience, and no overall effects on course performance, and recommend introducing feedback types one by one and offering them for substantial periods of time.",,,,,952,51209634,Sietske Tacoma,72040773,P.

It investigates sexist assemblages through three of many potential elements: (1) the normatively gendered content presented to users through in-platform keyword and hashtag searches; (2) social media platforms’ community guidelines, which lay out platforms’ codes of conduct and reveal biases and subjectivities and (3) the over-simplification of gender identities that is necessary to algorithmically recommend content to users as they move through platforms. By the time the reader finds this article, the elements of the assemblages we identify might have shifted, but we hope the framework remains useful for those aiming to understand the relationship between content moderation and long-standing forms of inequality.",New Media & Society,2020.0,101,23,0,True,"This article proposes ‘sexist assemblages’ as a way of understanding how the human and mechanical elements that make up social media content moderation assemble to perpetuate normative gender roles, particularly white femininities, and to police content related to women and their bodies.",,,,,954,23180033,Y.

955,"Book Review: Simon Lindgren, Data Theory: Interpretive Sociology and Computational Methods","lack of analyses on children in the literature on social movements. In the concluding Chapter 6, the author makes suggestions for further studies on children as participants in social movements. Previous research on social movements has only addressed children’s participation in descriptive and incidental ways, if at all. The book contributes to a theoretically better grounded understanding of children’s forms of action. It thus also makes an important contribution to interdisciplinary research on childhoods and children’s rights by taking us beyond previous concepts of participation and making visible and re-conceptualizing the various forms of children’s agency and participation. The book helps to understand that there is something artificial about the formal separation between social movements of adults and those of children. The fact that children also have their own movements and often bring them into being themselves reflects the fact that childhood in contemporary western societies has to do with a specific, largely subordinate social status that goes hand in hand with institutional separation from the adult world. Therefore, autonomous movements of children move in a dichotomy: on the one hand, they represent nolens volens the bourgeois ideology of childhood, which is based on and solidifies the separation of children and adults; on the other hand, children in the divided society have no choice but to organize themselves as children. Diane Rodgers’ study makes it clear that they never do this only in their role as children and that the children’s movements that see themselves as autonomous are not about generational conflicts or a struggle between children and adults. It would be interesting to discuss the question of the extent to which children themselves act as protagonists visa-vis adults and suggest to them that they arrive at new perspectives on social and political challenges. The climate movement Fridays for Future is a recent example of this. Future studies could make clear what it means for adults to be in solidarity with children and for children to meet each other not as adversaries but as allies. The tense relationship between children and adults or between young and old generations will not be overcome seamlessly, but it can become visible that the generational asymmetry often invoked in childhood studies is not a natural phenomenon but a socially produced one.",Sociology,2021.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,955,1868515,Alexander Halavais,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,Review
956,"A Systematic Scoping Review of the Prevalence, Etiological, Psychological, and Interpersonal Factors Associated with BDSM","ABSTRACT BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, and sadomasochism) encompasses a diverse set of sexual interests. Research interests in BDSM have been historically underpinned by examining potential mental health issues, unhealthy fixations on specific sexual behaviors, and/or the presence of childhood trauma, as is predicted by psychopathological and psychoanalytic models. The objective of this scoping review was to provide an overview of the current landscape of BDSM research, including incidence rates, evidence for psychopathological, psychoanalytical, biological, and social etiological factors, demographics of BDSM practitioners, and the psychological correlates of those with BDSM interests. After the literature search and screening process, 60 articles were included. BDSM related fantasies were found to be common (40-70%) in both males and females, while about 20% reported engaging in BDSM. Results show little support for psychopathologic or psychoanalytic models. In the selected samples studied, BDSM practitioners appear to be white, well educated, young, and do not show higher rates of mental health or relationship problems.

Locating such suggestions is difficult, not only due to the long-tailed nature of web search, but also due to differences in how people assess potential harms. Grounding our study in web search query logs, we explore when system-provided suggestions might be perceived as problematic through a series of crowd-experiments where we systematically manipulate: the search query fragments provided by users, possible user search intents, and the list of query completion suggestions. To examine why query suggestions might be perceived as problematic, we contrast them to an inventory of known types of problematic suggestions. We report our observations around differences in the prevalence of a) suggestions that are problematic on their own versus b) suggestions that are problematic for the query fragment provided by a user, for both common informational needs and in the presence of web search voids-topics searched by few to no users. Our experiments surface a rich array of scenarios where suggestions are considered problematic, including due to the context in which they were surfaced. Compounded by the elusive nature of many such scenarios, the prevalence of suggestions perceived as problematic only for certain user inputs, raises concerns about blind spots due to data annotation practices that may lead to some types of problematic suggestions being overlooked.",Proc.

Such workplace surveillance is extensive in the United States, but its experience and potential consequences differ across groups based on gender. We thus sought to identify whether self‐reported male and female employees differ in the extent to which they find the use of workplace cameras equipped with facial recognition technology (FRT) acceptable, and examine the role of privacy attitudes more generally in mediating views on workplace surveillance. Using data from a nationally representative survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, we find that women are much less likely than men to approve of the use of cameras using FRT in the workplace. We then further explore whether men and women think differently about privacy, and if perceptions of privacy moderate the relationship between gender and approval of workplace surveillance. Finally, we consider the implications of these findings for privacy and surveillance via embedded technologies, and how the consequences of surveillance and technologies like FRT may be gendered.

966,"Sex- and Poverty-Specific Patterns in Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Associated With Human Immunodeficiency Virus, New York City, 2007–2017","
 
 
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may affect the risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) differently in men versus women.
 
 
 
 We examined CVD mortality rates between 2007 and 2017 among all New York City residents living with HIV and aged 13+ by sex, using data from city HIV surveillance and vital statistics and the National Death Index. Residents without HIV were enumerated using modified US intercensal estimates. We determined associations of HIV status with CVD mortality by sex and neighborhood poverty, defined as the percent of residents living below the federal poverty level, after accounting for age, race/ethnicity, and year.
 
 
 
 There were 3234 CVD deaths reported among 147 915 New Yorkers living with HIV, with the proportion of deaths due to CVD increasing from 11% in 2007 to 22% in 2017. The age-standardized CVD mortality rate was 2.7/1000 person-years among both men and women with HIV. The relative rate of CVD mortality associated with HIV status was significantly higher among women (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–1.8) than men (aRR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.3) overall, and within strata defined by neighborhood poverty. Sex differences in CVD mortality rates were the greatest when comparing individuals living with HIV and having detectable HIV RNA and CD4+ T-cell counts <500 cells/uL with individuals living without HIV.
 
 
 
 Among people with HIV, 1 in 5 deaths is now associated with CVD. HIV providers should recognize the CVD risk among women with HIV, and reinforce preventive measures (eg, smoking cessation, blood pressure control, lipid management) and viremic control among people living with HIV regardless of neighborhood poverty to reduce CVD mortality.
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases cardiovascular disease mortality risks to a greater degree among women than men, even after accounting for neighborhood poverty. HIV providers should emphasize cardiovascular disease prevention (eg, smoking cessation, hypertension control, lipid management) and viremic control.

971,BASIC CONCEPTS OF ENRICHED CATEGORY THEORY,"Although numerous contributions from divers authors, over the past fifteen years or so, have brought enriched category theory to a developed state, there is still no connected account of the theory, or even of a substantial part of it. As the applications of the theory continue to expand - some recent examples are given below - the lack of such an account is the more acutely felt. The present book is designed to supply the want in part, by giving a fairly complete treatment of the limited area to which the title refers. The basic concepts of category theory certainly include the notion of functor-category, of limit and colimit, of Kan extension, and of density; with their applications to completions, perhaps including those relative completions given by categories of algebras for limit-defined theories. If we read 'V-category' for 'category' here, this is essentially the list of our chapter-headings below, after the first chapter introducing V-categories.  In fact our scope is wider than this might suggest; for what we give is also a selfcontained account of basic category theory as described above, assuming as prior knowledge only the most elementary categorical concepts, and treating the ordinary and enriched cases together from Chapter 3 on.",Elements of ∞-Category Theory,2022.0,77,1335,118,True,,,,,,971,145794761,G.

973,"Women candidates, women voters, and the gender politics of India’s 2019 parliamentary election","ABSTRACT Gender quota campaigns to increase women’s parliamentary presence in India have been ongoing for more than twenty years. Meanwhile, each general election results in the slow growth of women MPs, partly due to political parties nominating few women. The 2019 election was no different in this respect –women still make up fewer than 15% of lower house MPs. Incidents of gendered violence against women candidates also contributed to a characterisation of 2019 as a ‘toxic’ election, and will likely further discourage women’s entry into politics. One positive development, however, was two regional parties’ implementation of voluntary party gender quotas in their parliamentary candidate nominations. This article focuses on women’s political participation as candidates and voters in the 2019 parliamentary election. Parties are scrutinised as key gatekeepers for women’s political recruitment. The article also discusses the new narrative of the growing power of women voters in India, exemplified by closing gender gaps in voter turnout, and representing another aspect of women’s political engagement, potentially influencing parties’ responsiveness to women voters. The article concludes by discussing the broader implications and significance of the 2019 election, areas for further research, and prospects for women’s participation and representation in the new parliament.",,2020.0,84,6,1,False,,,,,,973,14740490,Carole Spary,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

Utilizing the resiliency and intersectionality perspectives of minority stress, this study seeks to address this gap by examining the effects of community and individual resilience on psychological well-being among gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer (GLBTQ) people of color in emerging adulthood. Specifically, the extent to which perceived family support, GLBTQ community involvement, and perceived neighborhood homophobia are associated with psychological well-being is examined; as well as the extent to which sexual identity prominence and outness explain these associations. Utilizing data from a national sample (N = 941), our results highlight the direct effects of community resilience on psychological well-being as well as the mediating effects of sexual identity outness. In addition, perceived neighborhood homophobia was negatively associated with sexual identity outness and psychological well-being, and positively associated with sexual identity prominence. Moreover, results were not significantly different based on race, gender, and sexual identity groups.

977,"The cost of being transgender: where socio-economic status, global health care systems, and gender identity intersect","ABSTRACT Around the globe, trans and gender diverse people have a wide range of access to health care, psychological as well as physical, that is unique to their home country’s context. Some of the contributing factors are nations’ health care systems, laws and policies surrounding discrimination, adequate resources, and under-trained health care professionals. Unfortunately, inability or difficulty in accessing transition related health care and support leads to negative impacts on mental health. In this article, the authors describe the unique contexts related to transgender health care in Canada, Japan, South Africa, and the United States. We focus specifically on the financial cost of transition for trans and gender diverse people, including gender affirming surgeries as well as mental and health care more broadly. We discuss the role of mental health professionals as advocates for gender affirming care and the fundamental human right to health care. We include discussions of therapy, assessment, medical care such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and surgeries, and additional invisible costs. We highlight the importance for all mental health professionals to be aware of the impacts to trans and gender diverse people’s mental health when their fundamental health care needs are not met.

Precarious working conditions, hierarchical organizations, a normalization of gender-based violence, toxic academic masculinities, a culture of silence and a lack of active leadership are all key features enabling sexual harassment. The aim of this study is to review scientific knowledge on sexual harassment in higher education. A thematic focus is on (a) knowledge derived from top-ranked peer-reviewed articles in the research field, (b) the prevalence of sexual harassment among students and staff, (c) reported consequences of sexual harassment, (d) examples of primary, secondary and tertiary preventive measures, and (e) core challenges to research on sexual harassment in higher education. The published research evidence suggests several findings of importance, mainly: (a) prevalence of sexual harassment among students is reported by on average one out of four female students; (b) severe consequences of sexual harassment impacts individuals but the effects on the quality in research and education is unknown; (c) there is almost no evidence supporting the supposed effects of major preventive measures; and (d) research on sexual harassment in higher education lacks theoretical, longitudinal, qualitative and intersectional approaches and perspectives.",European Journal of Higher Education,2020.0,131,93,8,False,,,,,,978,52325926,Fredrik Bondestam,2069337264,M.

979,Development and Validation of a Scale to Measure Intimate Partner Violence Among Transgender and Gender Diverse Populations: Protocol for a Linear Three-Phase Study (Project Empower),"Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is approximately twice as prevalent among transgender and gender diverse individuals (those whose current gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth) than among cisgender individuals (those whose gender aligns with their sex assigned at birth). However, most existing scales measuring IPV are not validated among transgender and gender diverse populations and do not consider the unique forms of IPV experienced by transgender and gender diverse individuals. Objective This paper describes the protocol for Project Empower, a study that seeks to develop and validate a new scale to measure IPV as experienced by transgender and gender diverse adults. A new scale is necessary to improve the accuracy of IPV measurement among transgender and gender diverse populations and may inform the current tools used to screen and link to services for transgender and gender diverse people who experience or perpetrate IPV. Methods The proposed new scale will be developed by a linear three-phase process. In Phase I, we will recruit a maximum of 110 transgender and gender diverse participants to participate in in-depth interviews and focus groups. Phase I will collect qualitative data on the experiences of IPV among transgender and gender individuals. After generating scale items from the qualitative data in Phase I, Phase II will conduct up to 10 cognitive interviews to examine understanding of scale items and refine wording. Phase III will then conduct a survey with an online recruited sample of 700 transgender and gender diverse individuals to validate the scale using factor analysis and examine the prevalence, antecedents, and linked health outcomes of IPV. This study will generate the first comprehensive IPV scale including trans-specific IPV tactics that has undergone robust mixed-methods validation for use in transgender and gender diverse populations, regardless of sex assigned at birth. Results Project Empower launched in August 2019, with Phases I and II expected to be complete by late 2020. Phase III (survey of 700 transgender individuals) is expected to be launched in January 2021. Conclusions A scale that more accurately captures the forms of IPV experienced by transgender and gender diverse people not only has the potential to lead to more accurate measurements of prevalence but also can identify unique forms of violence that may form the basis of IPV prevention interventions. Additionally, identifying the forms of IPV experienced by transgender and gender diverse people has the potential to lead to the refinement of clinical screening tools used to identify and refer those who experience and perpetrate violence in clinical settings.

Testimonies of employees reporting workplace harassment were adapted into a screenplay. The screenplay presented ongoing verbal sexual harassment of an employee by her manager, filmed from the victim’s point of view by the use of a 360-degree camera. In a controlled experiment, change in attitudes on sexual harassment and empathy toward the victim were compared between participants consuming the content as either a written script, 2-dimensional screened video or 360-degree, 3-dimensional immersive virtual reality experience. The results point to an interaction effect, where a decrease in stereotypical views of sexual harassment was predicted by gender (men), method of consumption (immersive), and assessment of the effectiveness and emotionality of the content.

Our objective was to describe the prevalence of IPV, and risk factors associated with IPV in pregnant, rural Guatemalan women. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was completed using quality improvement data gathered during routine prenatal health visits to women of Trifinio, Guatemala, by the Madres Sanas maternal health program from 2018 through 2020. Chi-square and t-tests were used to determine if there were differences in characteristics between women who self-reported experiencing IPV and those who did not. If differences occurred (p < 0.2), those covariates were included in a multivariable logistic regression to determine sociodemographic risk associated with IPV. Results: 583 women were enrolled with Madres Sanas between October 10, 2018, and October 1, 2020, and reported on IPV. Nineteen (3.26%) women reported experiencing IPV. The highest prevalence of IPV (7.6%) occurred in the sub-group of women who experienced food insecurity during the past year. The sole covariate of all sociodemographic and health characteristics which differed significantly between women who reported experiencing and not experiencing IPV was food insecurity. A regression model found that those who had worried about ability to buy food in the past year had a 3.19-fold increase in the odds that they experienced IPV (95% CI 1.072, 9.486, p-value 0.037).

984,Racial/ethnic discrimination: Dimensions and relation to mental health symptoms in a marginalized urban American population.,"That racial/ethnic discrimination has adverse physical and psychological consequences, including stress, anxiety, depression, and their attendant health effects, is well documented. However, the particular dimensions within the broad construct of discrimination and their role in mental health are less well understood. This study investigates the dimensions of discrimination and explores their relation to depression and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. Using the Brief Perceived Ethnic/Racial Discrimination Questionnaire-Community Version, discrimination experiences were assessed among a community sample of African American and Latinx participants (N = 500). Factor analyses revealed 4 dimensions: Social Rejection, Stereotyping, Direct Threats/Attacks, and Police Mistreatment. In multivariate analyses, full regression models were significantly related to PTS and depression symptoms. Among the individual predictors, Social Rejection and ethnicity (Latinx) uniquely contributed to PTS symptoms in men, whereas Stereotyping and Direct Threat/Attack were associated with PTS symptoms for women. In regards to depressive symptoms, income, ethnicity (Latinx), and Social Rejection were significant predictors for men, while Social Rejection had an independent contribution for women. Thus, social rejection emerged as a significant unique predictor in 3 of the four models, suggesting that social ostracism may be a particularly harmful aspect of discrimination. Implications of these findings include the use of proactive and intervention strategies that emphasize a sense of belonging and mitigate the effects of exclusion and rejection.

988,Text-mining forma mentis networks reconstruct public perception of the STEM gender gap in social media,"Mindset reconstruction maps how individuals structure and perceive knowledge, a map unfolded here by investigating language and its cognitive reflection in the human mind, i.e., the mental lexicon. Textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) are glass boxes introduced for extracting and understanding mindsets’ structure (in Latin forma mentis) from textual data. Combining network science, psycholinguistics and Big Data, TFMNs successfully identified relevant concepts in benchmark texts, without supervision. Once validated, TFMNs were applied to the case study of distorted mindsets about the gender gap in science. Focusing on social media, this work analysed 10,000 tweets mostly representing individuals’ opinions at the beginning of posts. “Gender” and “gap” elicited a mostly positive, trustful and joyous perception, with semantic associates that: celebrated successful female scientists, related gender gap to wage differences, and hoped for a future resolution. The perception of “woman” highlighted jargon of sexual harassment and stereotype threat (a form of implicit cognitive bias) about women in science “sacrificing personal skills for success”. The semantic frame of “man” highlighted awareness of the myth of male superiority in science. No anger was detected around “person”, suggesting that tweets got less tense around genderless terms. No stereotypical perception of “scientist” was identified online, differently from real-world surveys. This analysis thus identified that Twitter discourse mostly starting conversations promoted a majorly stereotype-free, positive/trustful perception of gender disparity, aimed at closing the gap. Hence, future monitoring against discriminating language should focus on other parts of conversations like users’ replies.

989,LGBTQ bullying: a qualitative investigation of student and school health professional perspectives,"Abstract Researchers and practitioners have recently called for greater involvement of school health professionals (SHPs; e.g., school psychologists, nurses, guidance counselors) in interventions to identify and address bullying of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) students. To inform future interventions, this study explored the perspectives of LGBTQ students and SHPs on LGBTQ bullying and SHPs’ responses to LGBTQ bullying. Five online, asynchronous focus groups were held in 2018 with 28 LGBTQ students and 19 SHPs recruited from Massachusetts, US. Methods were guided by Rapid Qualitative Inquiry. Results revealed a disconnect in perceptions of LGBTQ bullying among LGBTQ students versus SHPs, with LGBTQ students reporting a range of often significant verbal, social, and physical bullying experiences and SHPs reporting minimal awareness of LGBTQ bullying at their schools. Transgender students reported bullying related to their gender identity, including verbal, physical, and sexual harassment, deadnaming (referred to by their birth name), and misgendering (called an incorrect pronoun). LGBTQ students of color reported bullying based on their race/ethnicity and pronounced social isolation. LGBTQ students reported mixed experiences with reporting bullying to SHPs.

991,"We Built Reality: How Social Science Infiltrated Culture, Politics, and Power. By Jason Blakely. New York: Oxford University Press, 2020. 184p. $99.00 cloth, $27.95 paper.","Boldizzoni develops his argument that two cultural factors account for the persistence of capitalism in Western societies: a long history of social hierarchy/stratification (which has taken various forms from antiquity through feudalism and now in capitalism) and the more recent, modern emphasis on individualism. In contrast, societies with a history of less hierarchical social relations, such as Norway, have tended to adopt versions of capitalism closer to socialism (p. 260). Similarly, societies that “lacked an individualist social pattern, such as Russia” (p. 260) were the most viable candidates for socialist revolution, regardless of their stage of economic development. It seems plausible that these factors at least partly account for the persistence of capitalism. But it is not clear that they prove that the goal of ending capitalism, even in the long term, rests on somany “false hopes” (p. 4). Specifically, even if individualism and hierarchy are as supportive of capitalism and as resistant to change as Boldizzoni argues, why does that make radical change so unlikely? Boldizzoni baldly states that the “highly hierarchical social structure” and “individualistic social pattern” in Britain and most of Western Europe, and even more so in the United States, make it “difficult to imagine a radical change toward socialism” (p. 261). Given the long history of social hierarchy inWestern societies, it does seem unlikely to disappear quickly, if at all. However, the claim that this rules out the possibility of socialism rests on the assumption that socialism is necessarily incompatible with or resistant to any form of social stratification or inequality, an assumption that is contradicted by the principle of distribution according to contribution (in Marx’s first phase of communism) as well as by the principle of distribution according to needs (in communism’s higher phase). Similarly, to assume that individualism renders socialism unlikely ignores the importance that socialist thought and practice have placed on individual freedom and flourishing: recall Marx’s own line that the “free development of each will be the condition for the free development of all” in communism. It is true that the forms of social hierarchy and individualism that characterize contemporary capitalist society are at odds with most views of socialism, but they might be more subject to challenge and change than Boldizzoni assumes. Anger directed at the 1%, for example, registers disapproval of the current patterns of social stratification. And to what extent do the concrete forms that individualism now takes—such as careerism and opportunity hoarding—express genuine preferences as opposed to reluctant adaptations to structural constraints? Although Boldizzoni rightly criticizes others for dichotomous thinking, he too falls into the trap: either we focus on reformist politics that avoid the false hope of a foreseeable end of capitalism, or we succumb to the naïve wishful thinking of those who believe that more radical change is possible. But why are these mutually exclusive? Here one thinks of André Gorz’s concept of nonreformist reforms, most notably used by Nancy Fraser, as a way of thinking about reformist measures that carry a more transformative potential. Ironically, giving up hope of radical social change, as Boldizzoni counsels, will help fulfill the prophecy of capitalism’s persistence.",Perspectives on Politics,2021.0,0,4,0,False,,,,,,991,49608646,J.

992,A cross-sectional study of social inequities in medical crowdfunding campaigns in the United States,"Americans are increasingly relying on crowdfunding to pay for the costs of healthcare. In medical crowdfunding (MCF), online platforms allow individuals to appeal to social networks to request donations for health and medical needs. Users are often told that success depends on how they organize and share their campaigns to increase social network engagement. However, experts have cautioned that MCF could exacerbate health and social disparities by amplifying the choices (and biases) of the crowd and leveraging these to determine who has access to financial support for healthcare. To date, research on potential axes of disparity in MCF, and their impacts on fundraising outcomes, has been limited. To answer these questions, this paper presents an exploratory cross-sectional study of a randomized sample of 637 MCF campaigns on the popular platform GoFundMe, for which the race, gender, age, and relationships of campaigners and campaign recipients were categorized alongside campaign characteristics and outcomes. Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, the analysis examines race, gender, and age disparities in MCF use, and tests how these are associated with differential campaign outcomes. The results show systemic disparities in MCF use and outcomes: people of color (and black women in particular) are under-represented; there is significant evidence of an additional digital care labor burden on women organizers of campaigns; and marginalized race and gender groups are associated with poorer fundraising outcomes. Outcomes are only minimally associated with campaign characteristics under users’ control, such as photos, videos, and updates. These results corroborate widespread concerns with how technology fuels health inequities, and how crowdfunding may be creating an unequal and biased marketplace for those seeking financial support to access healthcare. Further research and better data access are needed to explore these dynamics more deeply and inform policy for this largely unregulated industry.",PLoS ONE,2019.0,91,35,0,True,"An exploratory cross-sectional study of a randomized sample of 637 medical crowdfunding campaigns on the popular platform GoFundMe, for which the race, gender, age, and relationships of campaigners and campaign recipients were categorized alongside campaign characteristics and outcomes show systemic disparities in MCF use and outcomes.",Html,"[{'title': 'plos.org', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229760'}]","N Kenworthy, Z Dong, A Montgomery, E Fuller… - PLoS …, 2020 - journals.plos.org","[{'name': 'N Kenworthy', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JwukLgkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=JwukLgkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'JwukLgkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'Z Dong', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ghII57IAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=ghII57IAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'ghII57IAAAAJ'}]",992,5275704,Nora Kenworthy,152476115,Zhihang Dong,32180344,A.

994,Measurement and impacts of intersectionality on obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms across intensive treatment.,"Historically, intensive obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (OCRD) treatment settings have been underrepresentative in terms of patient race and ethnicity. The present study piloted a novel technique to measure multiple marginalized identities and assess their impact on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and treatment response across intensive residential treatment (IRT). Participants included 715 residents receiving IRT for OCRD. Measures included the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS), Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44, and measures of depression and quality of life. In addition, we piloted a marginalized identity score, an additive measure of intersectionality. Most patients endorsed holding primarily privileged identities. Higher marginalized identity score was significantly correlated with higher depression symptom severity and lower quality of life throughout treatment. Both at baseline and discharge, higher marginalized identity score was significantly and positively correlated with greater OCD symptom severity. Higher marginalized identity score was significantly associated with greater severity of DOCS1, DOCS2, DOCS4, and obsessive beliefs across multiple domains. Consistent with previous literature, patients in our IRT setting were not demographically representative of the general population. Individuals with more marginalized identities endorsed higher symptoms of OCD, obsessive beliefs, OCD dimensions, and depression, as well as lower quality of life at admission and discharge. Results support increased consideration of the role marginalization plays in symptom severity, symptom presentation, and treatment response across treatment settings. Further investigation is warranted to better address the multiplicative effects of holding intersecting marginalized identities and how treatment may be adapted to ameliorate these inequities.

995,“We’ve got to get rid of her”: representation of older adults on the preschool television show Grandpa in My Pocket,"ABSTRACT Studies of television programs and films targeting children at elementary school age systematically reveal a vast spectrum of sexist and ageist stereotypes regarding older women and men, presenting children with distorted sociocultural perceptions that perpetuate the social marginalization and devaluation of older adults. Little is known, however, regarding prevailing stereotypes associated with older women and men in television programs targeting younger children, especially preschoolers. To fill this gap, the present study examined the salient gendered and ageist stereotypes embedded in the storylines of the well known Cbeebies television show “Grandpa in My Pocket”. By applying qualitative content analysis to 28 episodes of the show’s five seasons, we aimed at answering the following questions: What images of older men and women does this show convey to young children; and what models of social interaction the older adults maintain with other characters. Our findings show that this program actually misses its opportunity to present preschoolers with more positive images of older adults, and especially of older women, who are pictured as weird, bizarre, mean, socially isolated and devaluated. Moreover, the older women are systematically subjected to various forms of “comic violence”, including humiliation, intimidation and physical harm.",Journal of Children and Media,2020.0,94,4,0,False,,,,,,995,1485793504,Galit Rovner-Lev,2103727,Nelly Elias,,,,,,,,,Psychology,
996,Platforming Intersectionality: Networked Solidarity and the Limits of Corporate Social Media,"How do historically marginalized narratives spread on social media platforms? Developing research in collaboration with intersectional artists and community, or what we call “platforming intersectionality,” can reveal the promise and limitations of social media for bridging disparate, segregated communities, or “networked solidarity.” Using case studies of indie TV series about historically marginalized communities, we show that intersectionality can spread on corporate social media platforms, but the causes are largely visible outside of platforms, both online and offline. Basic conditions for spreading intersectional narratives may be met when the language used to describe them are simply communicated in ways algorithms and users can quickly understand. However, community members, including artists and publishers who produce for specific communities online and offline, serve as critical, under-appreciated nodes platforms leverage to spread intersectionality. We argue that reconceptualizing platforms as community-based media provides a better framework for understanding the power and limits of social media.",,2020.0,93,10,1,True,,,,,,996,32874834,A. J.

997,Creating gendered change in Irish higher education: is managerial leadership up to the task?,"Using a Feminist Institutional perspective, this paper suggests that the explanation for the slow pace of change in the gender profile of the professoriate lies in the gender awareness of managerial leadership. In Irish universities, women now constitute 51 per cent of the lecturers, but only 24 per cent of those at full professorial level and have, on average, a three times lesser ‘chance’ than men of accessing a professorship [-The context is one where power is concentrated at (male) presidential level and where managerial leadership is seen as driving change. Using an ex-post facto research design, involving a re-analysis of qualitative interview data collected from those at presidential, vice-presidential and dean level 10 years ago, it differentiates between four categories of gender awareness: denial of the existence or relevance of gender (mainly men); stereotypical awareness of gender (mainly men); awareness of gender inequality (both men and women) and gender competence (both men and women). Only a minority were in the latter category, which is seen as most likely to be associated with change in the professorial gender profile. Finally, the question of whether the under-representation of women in the professoriate across the EU could be similarly explained is raised.",,2020.0,87,15,1,True,,,"[{'title': 'ul.ie', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/8303/OConnor_2019_Creating.pdf?sequence=2'}]","P O'Connor - Irish Educational Studies, 2020 - Taylor & Francis",,997,1435444207,P.

While newsbots have begun to draw attention in journalism studies, little consideration has been given to how audiences perceive and respond to newsbots. Through the lens of human–machine communication (HMC), this article presents a case study of a newsbot interacting with Twitter users who shared news articles from the New York Times (NYT). In particular, we analyzed the Twitter users’ perceptions and responses to the newsbot using qualitative analysis. We found that Twitter users perceived the newsbot in several degrees: from ignoring it, to addressing the content curated by the newsbot, to responding to newsbot itself. Moreover, we found that Twitter users offered a range of opinions, personal experiences, facts, counter-arguments, and affective displays when they addressed the content or the newsbot. We discuss how newsbots can be effective tools to enhance news engagement, the obstacles that they face when they interact in online environments, and reflect on the range of communicative roles that newsbots play with online audiences.",,2020.0,80,6,1,False,,,,,,999,1404339764,Diego Gómez-Zará,2943892,N.

It contributes to scholarship concerning race and the virtual marketplace by examining tensions between the countercultural, communal and commercial qualities of Black women’s online experiences. Drawing upon theorising of the oppositional spectator gaze of Black women, and narratives of technology consumption, we unpack how Black women’s digital activity can enable them to navigate the hegemony of US content, their marginalisation in British mass-media, and situate them within a Black experience that transcends Britain’s borders. Our work illustrates how Black women’s online encounters can be a source of resistance, Black digital commentary and community, as well as being subject to corporate co-optation. We conceptualise such online experiences as being shaped by transnational dimensions of the relationship between race, media and markets.","Consumption, markets & culture",2019.0,89,22,0,True,,,,,,1001,115455971,Francesca Sobande,15328015,A.

1003,The Health Consequences of Neocolonialism for Latin American Immigrant Women Working as Caregivers in Spain: A Multisite Qualitative Analysis,"In Spain, most jobs available for Latin American immigrant women are in intimate labour (caregiving and domestic work). This work is usually performed under informal employment conditions. The objective of this study was to explain how the colonial logic mediates the experiences of Latin American women working in intimate labour in Spain, and the effects of such occupation on their health and wellbeing, using a decolonial theoretical framework. A multi-site secondary data analysis of qualitative data from four previous studies was performed utilizing 101 interviews with Latin American immigrant women working as caregivers in Spain. Three interwoven categories show how the dominant colonial logic in Spain creates low social status and precarious jobs, and naturalizes intimate labour as their métier while producing detrimental physical and psychosocial health consequences for these immigrant caregivers. The caregivers displayed several strategies to resist and navigate intimate labour and manage its negative impact on health. Respect and integration into the family for whom they work had a buffering effect, mediating the effects of working conditions on health and wellbeing. Based on our analysis, we suggest that employment, social, and health protection laws and strategies are needed to promote a positive working environment, and to reduce the impact of caregiving work for Latin American caregivers.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2020.0,118,1,0,True,"It is suggested that employment, social, and health protection laws and strategies are needed to promote a positive working environment, and to reduce the impact of caregiving work for Latin American caregivers.",,,,,1003,101914427,E.

1005,"Stigma and discrimination related to mental health and substance use issues in primary health care in Toronto, Canada: a qualitative study","ABSTRACT Purpose: Community Health Centres (CHCs) are an essential component of primary health care (PHC) in Canada. This article examines health providers’ understandings and experiences regarding stigma towards mental health and substance use (MHSU) issues, as well as their ideas for an effective intervention to address stigma and discrimination, in three CHCs in Toronto, Ontario. Methods: Using a phenomenological approach, we conducted twenty-three interviews with senior staff members and peer workers, and three focus groups with front-line health providers. Ahybrid approach to thematic analysis was employed, entailing a combination of emergent and a priori coding. Results: The findings indicate that PHC settings are sites where multiple forms of stigma create health service barriers.

1006,"Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness","NUDGE: IMPROVING DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTH, WEALTH, AND HAPPINESS by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein Penguin Books, 2009, 312 pp, ISBN 978-0-14-311526-7This book is best described formally as a general explanation of and advocacy for libertarian paternalism, a term coined by the authors in earlier publications. Informally, it is about how leaders, systems, organizations, and governments can nudge people to do the things the nudgers want and need done for the betterment of the nudgees, or of society. It is paternalism in the sense that ""it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people's behavior in order to make their lives longer, healthier, and better"", (p. 5) It is libertarian in that ""people should be free to do what they like - and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so"", (p. 5) The built-in possibility of opting out or making a different choice preserves freedom of choice even though people's behavior has been influenced by the nature of the presentation of the information or by the structure of the decisionmaking system. I had never heard of libertarian paternalism before reading this book, and I now find it fascinating.Written for a general audience, this book contains mostly social and behavioral science theory and models, but there is considerable discussion of structure and process that has roots in mathematical and quantitative modeling. One of the main applications of this social system is economic choice in investing, selecting and purchasing products and services, systems of taxes, banking (mortgages, borrowing, savings), and retirement systems. Other quantitative social choice systems discussed include environmental effects, health care plans, gambling, and organ donations. Softer issues that are also subject to a nudge-based approach are marriage, education, eating, drinking, smoking, influence, spread of information, and politics. There is something in this book for everyone.The basis for this libertarian paternalism concept is in the social theory called ""science of choice"", the study of the design and implementation of influence systems on various kinds of people. The terms Econs and Humans, are used to refer to people with either considerable or little rational decision-making talent, respectively. The various libertarian paternalism concepts and systems presented are tested and compared in light of these two types of people. Two foundational issues that this book has in common with another book, Network of Echoes: Imitation, Innovation and Invisible Leaders, that was also reviewed for this issue of the Journal are that 1 ) there are two modes of thinking (or components of the brain) - an automatic (intuitive) process and a reflective (rational) process and 2) the need for conformity and the desire for imitation are powerful forces in human behavior. …",,2015.0,0,5173,419,False,,,,,,1006,3189820,Chris Arney,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,Review

1010,Fleshing out enactments of Whiteness in antiracist pedagogy: snapshot of a White teacher educator’s practice,"ABSTRACT This article paints a partial portrait of a White, antiracist, university-based teacher educator in the United States, and provides a snapshot of her antiracist pedagogy in practice. This snapshot is juxtaposed against (her own and others’) theorising of antiracist pedagogy. Using reflexivity as methodology, I pay attention to my noticings of my participant’s antiracist pedagogy as evidenced through her navigation of a racialised, affectively charged classroom encounter involving the teacher educator, a Black student, and me, a Black researcher. I analyze the embodied and affective aspects of that experience through a racialised lens and find that the teacher educator’s (re)actions represent an enactment of Whiteness. The enactment relates to the enfleshed material body. Thus, I contend that the development of an antiracist pedagogy that moves beyond rhetoric in resisting rather than reinforcing Whiteness – and therefore, that contributes meaningfully to racial justice – requires attunement to affects produced via interembodiment, in theory and practice.","Pedagogy, Culture & Society",2020.0,125,13,1,False,,,,,,1010,115799683,Esther O.

1013,Imagining a curriculum beyond compulsory heterosexuality in South African education,"Abstract There is a critical need for sex, sexuality and relationships education to be LGBTQI inclusive. Numerous studies, internationally and in South Africa, highlight this need but what constitutes an inclusive curriculum has not been sufficiently addressed. This paper seeks to advance this conversation by imagining a curriculum beyond compulsory heterosexuality and considers what knowledges and practices are necessary for the South African context. To do this, the authors consider the corpus of research about how sexualities are characterized in schooling generally and in the teaching of sexuality education specifically. Using the theoretical tools offered by Freire and hooks on critical consciousness, three arguments are made. First, the authors argue for the theoretical and empirical contributions of the sociology of gender and sexualities which are social constructions informed by history, social relations and power. Second, there is a need for a curriculum to recognize the intersectionality of learners and how identity knowledges shape the way that youth sexualities are understood and experienced. Finally, the teaching and learning of an LGBTQI inclusive curriculum will steer away from moralistic and didactic instruction in favor of more participatory pedagogies that acknowledge young people as agents and legitimate sexual beings.",Journal of LGBT Youth,2020.0,73,2,0,False,,,,"DA Francis, K Kuhl - Journal of LGBT Youth, 2020 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'DA Francis', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zcACv-0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=zcACv-0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'zcACv-0AAAAJ'}]",1013,50601048,D.

1015,Visualising violence? Capturing and critiquing body-worn video camera evidence of domestic and family violence,"ABSTRACT Heralded as an evidentiary ‘game changer’, body-worn video cameras (BWVCs) have recently been utilised by justice agents in domestic and family violence (DFV) responses. Proponents assert that BWVC footage can: strengthen evidential cases; improve the probability of guilty pleas or convictions; reduce State expenditure; and bolster police accountability and perceptions of procedural justice. There has been little consideration of how BWVCs might shape victim/survivor experiences of the justice system. In this article, I discuss (and foreground) missing voices on BWVCs, drawing on a project completed with Australian female victim/survivors. I unpack issues that women have flagged as important; whether or not BWVC footage might prompt reviews of police actions and failures to act, serve their best interests and impact their journey through the justice system. Exploring interdisciplinary literature and police and judicial statements in public discourse, I examine expectations about how women present and understandings of the dynamics and effects of DFV. Questioning claims that BWVCs provide neutral footage, I contend that representations are subject to interpretation, governed by practical, ideological and social standpoints, biases and constraints. To study BWVC evidence we must consider the media, the incident-based focus of BWVCs and the relationality between image and spectator.",,2020.0,44,7,0,False,,,,"BA Harris - Current Issues in Criminal Justice, 2020 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'BA Harris', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0YTANUkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0YTANUkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '0YTANUkAAAAJ'}]",1015,2013730171,Bridget A.

1019,Technology and Democracy : Understanding the influence of online technologies on political behaviour and decision-making.,"This report is the second output from the Joint Research Centre’s (JRC) Enlightenment 2.0 multi-annual research programme. The work started with the classical Enlightenment premise that reason is the primary source of political authority and legitimacy. Recognising that advances in behavioural, decision and social sciences demonstrate that we are not purely rational beings, we sought to understand the other drivers that influence political decision-making. The first output “Understanding our political nature: how to put knowledge and reason at the heart of policymaking” published in 20191, addressed some of the most pressing political issues of our age. However, some areas that we consider crucial to providing an updated scientific model of the drivers of political decision-making were not fully addressed. One of them is the impact of our contemporary digital information space on the socio-psychological mechanisms of opinion formation, decision-making and political behaviour. The JRC, together with a team of renowned experts addresses this knowledge deficit in a report that synthesises the knowledge about digital technology, democracy and human behaviour to enable policymakers to safeguard a participatory and democratic European future through legislation that aligns with human thinking and behaviour in a digital context. It is hoped that this report will prove useful as policymakers reflect upon the forthcoming European Democracy Action Plan, the Digital Services Act, the EU Citizenship Report 2020, as well as on how to legislate against disinformation. The report has been written in spring/summer of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of Europe and the world. During this time, our democracies suffered while technology played a crucial role in keeping societies functioning in times of lockdown. From remote distance education to teleworking, religious services to staying in touch with family and friends, for many but not all, everyday activities moved online. Additionally, technological applications and initiatives multiplied in an attempt to limit the spread of the disease, treat patients and facilitate the tasks of overworked essential personnel. Conversely, however, significant fundamental rights questions have been raised as unprecedented initiatives to track, trace and contain the pandemic using digital technologies have proven controversial. Governments invoking emergency measures in support of public health decision-making, used advanced analytics to collect, process and share data for effective front-line responses that lacked transparency and public consultation. When used as an information source, social media have been found to present a health risk that is partly due to their role as disseminators of health-related conspiracies, with non-English language speakers being at greater risk of exposure to misinformation during the crisis. It is likely that these technologies will have a long-lasting impact beyond COVID-19. Yet despite the immediacy of the crisis, the authors invite the reader to take a longer perspective on technology and democracy to get a deeper understanding of the interrelated nuances. In dark times, we seek to bring light to the importance of understanding the influence of online technologies on political behaviour and decision-making.",,2020.0,0,27,1,False,,,,,,1019,2573193,S.

1020,Effectiveness of a Prevention Program for Gender-Based Intimate Partner Violence at a Colombian Primary School,"Intimate partner violence, particularly against women, is widely studied owing to its high rates, based on transnational data. Colombia, where this form of violence is considerably common, is no exception, and such violence is occurring more and more often in increasingly younger couples (10−14 years old). Further, risk factors such as wide acceptance, the justification of intimate partner violence, extremely rigid traditional gender roles, and poor socio-emotional skills play a crucial role. In accordance with this reality, a gender-based intimate partner violence prevention program was designed, implemented, and evaluated for primary school children in Colombia based on a review of successful preventive programs and an identification of the main predictors of intimate partner violence. The program was evaluated using a quantitative study with a quasi-experimental design that included an experimental and a control group. In total, 344 participants were involved in the study: 195 boys (56.7%) and 149 girls (43.4%) from the second and third grades of a primary school (average age: 7.8 years) at a Colombian educational institution. The experimental group consisted of 200 participants and the control group of 144 participants. The program’s effectiveness was evaluated by measuring three groups of variables (gender stereotypes, the acceptance of violence, and socio-emotional skills) using reliable scales. To analyze the program’s effectiveness, mixed ANOVAs with a within-subjects factor (when the group was measured), two between-subjects factors (group and gender), and a covariate (age) were used. The results showed that the participants in the experimental group had lower scores in gender stereotypes, acceptance of peer aggression, and acceptance of physical violence against women compared to the control group. Conversely, they had higher scores in affective empathy after the intervention; both groups showed no significant differences before the intervention. This program is highly relevant because it has proven to have a positive impact on the participants and is innovative due to the lack of preventive programs that have been implemented in primary education and evaluated within the Colombian context.",Frontiers in Psychology,2020.0,157,5,1,True,"A gender-based intimate partner violence prevention program was designed, implemented, and evaluated for primary school children in Colombia based on a review of successful preventive programs and an identification of the main predictors of intimate partner Violence.",,,,,1020,1490036764,Anni Marcela Garzón Segura,7577242,Rodrigo J.

1021,The Palgrave Handbook of Critical Menstruation Studies,"With 72 chapters, written by 134 contributors from more than 30 countries, The Palgrave Handbook of Critical Menstruation Studies is an open access, multidisciplinary and comprehensive exploration of menstruation across the lifespan. The collection is organised into six overlapping thematic sections (menstruation as fundamental, embodied, rationale, structural, material and narrative), focused on two central questions: what new lines of enquiry are possible when menstrual health and politics are centralised; and, what knowledge is gained when menstruation emerges as a dynamic category of analysis? The handbook seamlessly blends empirical research with theoretical essays, poetry, visual arts, and first-person narratives. Each section ends with a transnational dialogue between multiple collaborators. In the introduction, the editors acknowledge how the collection fails to adequately decentre Western voices. At the launch event for the collection, the editors discussed how they could have done more to actively recruit authors from the global South, as well as the challenges associated with publishing an English-language collection with a global scope. However, the six transnational conversations are a strength of the collection. They effectively dismantle geopolitical silos, challenge colonial borders, facilitate knowledge translation, and are demonstrative of the editors’ and contributors’ shared commitment to understanding menstruation within various political, social, cultural, temporal, and geographic contexts. The handbook challenges readers to consider menstruators who have been historically marginalised in society and within Western-, cis-, white-, middle-class-, and neurotypical-centric reproductive and sexual health research. The collection includes chapters focused on autistic (Steward et al.), trans and non-binary (Frank & Dellaria; Rydström), homeless (Vora), incarcerated (Bozelko; Roberts), sex-worker (Bobier), disabled (Steele & Goldblatt), migrant and refugee (Hawkey et al.) and religious (Cohen; Mirvis; Sukumar; Maharaj & Winkler) menstruators. In a chapter on policy and practice pathways to addressing menstrual stigma, Patkar discusses advances in India, Senegal, Kenya, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cameroon, Maldives, Nepal, Niger, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. The author offers insightful and pragmatic policy recommendations that are applicable and appropriate in diverse countries, where menstrual and gender equity can be advanced using noncontroversial entry points such as water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions. Patkar’s contribution is complemented by Hennegan’s systematic review which assesses the effectiveness of menstrual health interventions in lowand middle-income countries. Based on her findings, Hennegan makes concrete recommendations for implementing evidence-based menstrual equity interventions and for improving intervention research aimed at reducing and eliminating menstrual inequities. Levitt and Barnack-Tavlaris’ chapter focuses on the menstrual leave debate, policies which would provide employees with time off during menstruation. The authors explore the existence of national and organisational menstrual leave policies in Japan, Taiwan, China, South Korea, Indonesia, Zambia, Australia, India, and Mexico. The authors discuss these policies within the broader context of menstrual stigma, gender inequities and pervasive heteropatriarchal culture, and critically engage with both their potential benefits and drawbacks. Their chapter pairs nicely with Weiss-Wolf’s work on policymaking in the United States which acknowledges challenging the tampon tax as an entry point into broader policy change. These four chapters, among others, offer insights into the appropriateness and effectiveness of public health interventions, policymaking, and human rights frames, where these strategies can be deployed alone or in combination with BOOKSHELF",Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters,2020.0,2,47,1,True,"The Palgrave Handbook of Critical Menstruation Studies challenges readers to consider menstruators who have been historically marginalised in society and within Western-, cis-, white-, middle-class-, and neurotypical-centric reproductive and sexual health research.",,,,,1021,,AJ Lowik,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,"JournalArticle, Review"

Furthermore, it examines the role body image ideals play on mobile dating applications (“dating apps”) for gay and bisexual men. Guided by Objectification Theory and Minority Stress Theory, 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted with young gay and bisexual men (ages 18-30 years) in Massachusetts. Using thematic analysis, three central themes emerged: 1) the ideal male body: muscular, thin, and light-skin toned; 2) discrimination; 3) navigating deviations from the ideal body: appearance comparison, retaliation, and body regulation and weight control behaviors. Our results suggest the dominant ideal male body is muscular and thin. Racial/ethnic minority participants added this ideal is further characterized as white/light-skin toned. Further, participants reported a wide variety of discriminatory experiences on dating apps, especially men deviating from the dominant body ideal. Over half of the men in our sample who reported use of dating apps recounted at least one experience of racial/ethnic discrimination or body weight and shape discrimination on dating apps. While some dating apps have modified their policies to promote inclusivity, further research into the impact of dating app-mediated discrimination are warranted.",,2020.0,122,20,1,False,,,,,,1022,24632443,A.

1023,"‘To be a slut is to be free’: women in favela funk, performances of racialised femininity, and celebrity media","ABSTRACT Rio de Janeiro’s favela funk movement has been one of Brazil’s most important contemporary cultural and musical expressions. Favela funk arose out of Rio’s slums and combines diverse Brazilian and other beats from the African diaspora, and lyrics are performed with an aggressive, mocking tone, filled with sexual references. Poor women of colour in favela funk, also known as funkeiras, have been responsible for much of the celebrity media attention the movement enjoys, and with feminism’s recent renewed popularity, the women have been more frequently confronted with questions of feminism, considering most of them perform songs about gendered relationships. This essay investigates how and why once some funkeiras begin to call themselves feminists, they tend to engage in a more palatable (meaning, white and middle class) version of their femininity. As their performances of femininity become more conforming, their positive visibility as feminists in celebrity media increases – a drastic change, considering that celebrity media often portrays funkeiras in demeaning and scornful ways. I conclude that celebrity culture and mainstream celebrity feminism push funkeiras into normative performances of femininity that, though not necessarily traditional, are infused with norms that privilege whiteness and middle-classness.",Celebrity Studies,2020.0,101,0,0,False,,,,,,1023,2061059948,Raquel Moreira,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

1027,"LGBTQ+ students in higher education: an evaluation of website data and accessible, ongoing resources in Ontario universities","ABSTRACT Students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+) are at high risk of being harassed and discriminated. As such, they are in need of a welcoming and inclusive campus environment, and specific resources to support them. A review of the current literature describes how heavily campus environment is linked to LGBTQ+ student mental health, and the importance of the availability of resources. Current literature is analysed for specific issues facing LGBTQ+ students, demonstrating their need for positive environments and LGBTQ+ specific resources. Whereas many institutions may claim that they support LGBTQ+ students, enactment of this support is examined by describing the way universities speak about LGBTQ+ students and communities, the resources made available to them, and how easily accessible those resources are to their students, specifically online. This study reveals that there are few ongoing, accessible resources for LGBTQ+ students in Ontario, Canada, and that there is a profound lack of focus on resources for mental health, which are very much needed. The results of the study uncover the need for institutions to provide more ongoing resources to students, and to make those resources clearly accessible through website searches.",,2020.0,65,0,0,False,,,,,,1027,1861807297,Rachel Schenk Martin,101256934,T.

1028,The Truth Is Out There: The Prevalence of Conspiracy Theory Use by Radical Violent Extremist Organizations,"ABSTRACT This project examined conspiracy theory use across three types of groups: radical violent extremists (RVE), nonviolent extremists, and moderates. Using the theory of significance quest, or the desire for one’s life to have meaning, the current project determined whether RVE groups were more likely to use conspiracy theories and promote loss of significance in violent passages than the other groups. Using text analysis software, researchers coded passages from six groups—two from each level of extremism—for conspiratorial and/or violent content. RVE groups were significantly more likely than the other groups to use conspiracy theories and promote violence. This pattern held for groups focused on radical Islamic fundamentalism as well as white supremacy groups. The pattern was more complex for loss of significance: in violent passages, neo-Nazis were significantly more likely than ISIS and Al Qaeda to promote loss of significance. Implications of the findings are discussed.",Terrorism and Political Violence,2020.0,61,10,0,False,,,,,,1028,116913485,Gregory J Rousis,2071576542,F. D.

Through the investigation of a vast empirical, theoretical literature and critical thinking on the directions taken by research, the distinctive features and the complexity of violence against women are pointed out. Variable in terms of impact and form, violence against women is a feature not only present in widely-differing geo-cultural realities but also persistent and showing a polymorphic, transverse character related to male dominance which enables it (until now) to survive many social and legislative changes. As well as identifying the particular features and changing forms of this type of violence, quite unlike any other, the essay stresses the adaptive, endemic and persistent character of this phenomenon and highlights above all its intimate and political matrix.",,2020.0,188,2,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/64514690/Towards%20an%20integrated%20approach%20to%20violence%20against%20women%20persistence%20specificity%20and%20complexity.pdf'}]","MG Musso, M Proietti, RR Reynolds - International Review of …, 2020 - Taylor & Francis",,1029,37319926,M.

1031,Risk Factor Patterns in Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking Relationships,"ABSTRACT Domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) is the commercial sexual exploitation of a minor citizen or legal resident within United States borders. Officials often view DMST as a monolithic crime, rather than a problem driven by victims’ variable experiences with poverty, racism, and family dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to explore how various risk factors are associated with one another and with DMST victimization, particularly within specific subcategories of DMST, such as trafficking by a family member, stranger, friend, or romantic partner. This study utilizes the archival data from 242 sex trafficked minors. The author coded the case files for the presence of risk factors, such as race, child welfare involvement, juvenile justice involvement, poverty, and more. Then, the author employed chi-square procedures to explore the association between risk factors, and between risk factors and victim-trafficker relationship type. Findings suggest that DMST victimization is not a uniform phenomenon, in which all victims share the same risks. There appears to be variations between the risk factors experienced by victims prior to entering specific relationship dynamics. Counter-trafficking advocates need to articulate these variations to the range of professionals who work within the systems that may prevent, identify, and remediate DMST.",Journal of Human Trafficking,2020.0,70,17,1,False,"There appears to be variations between the risk factors experienced by victims prior to entering specific relationship dynamics, and counter-trafficking advocates need to articulate these variations to the range of professionals who work within the systems that may prevent, identify, and remediate DMST.",,,,,1031,40861575,Mary K.

1032,Workplace Protections and Burnout Among Brazilian Frontline Health Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Health care workers from low- and middle-income countries have been playing a critical role in overcoming the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic; yet little is known about the relationship between workplace protections and wellbeing of Brazilian health care workers during the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate whether Brazilian health care workers were satisfied with their workplace measures to protect their physical and mental health during the pandemic, and to assess the associations of such levels of satisfaction with indicators of burnout. Licensed Brazilian health care professionals were recruited via popular media between 5/19/2020 and 8/23/2020 to complete an online survey including questions about their demographic/professional characteristics, satisfaction with their workplace protective measures during the pandemic, and validated questionnaires assessing neuroticism, resilient coping, and symptoms of burnout. Most participants reported being dissatisfied with their workplace measures to protect their physical (516, 56.3%) and mental health (756, 82.5%). In multivariable analysis adjusted for personal and environmental factors, dissatisfaction with workplace physical health protections was significantly associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion (B = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.47–1.69) and depersonalization (B = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.10–1.12), and dissatisfaction with workplace mental health protections significantly associated with higher levels emotional exhaustion (B = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.40–1.95). Efforts to improve both physical and mental health protective measures are critical to guarantee that health care workers continue to provide care at their maximum capacity.",Frontiers in Psychology,2022.0,32,0,0,True,Examination of the relationship between workplace protections and wellbeing of Brazilian health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic found dissatisfaction with workplace physical health protections was significantly associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.,,,,,1032,1398593689,K.

1035,The Future of TV Advertising Targeting Young Slovak Consumers,"The consumer preferences and behaviour should be considered with the purpose to implement marketing strategies in today's world successfully. It is crucial to understand how consumers find information and how the consumer decision-making process develops in time. Therefore, for advertisers, considering the behaviour of their target audience is of paramount importance. Integrated marketing communication programs reflect the way online search and traditional and new media, such as smartphones, TV, and social media, influence consumer decision-making. Young consumers, often referred to as generations Y and Z, are very different from previous generations in terms of multimedia content consumption and their perception of television advertising. This paper aims at providing insights into this behaviour, including actions that follow-up as a response to television advertising. Results of a quantitative study performed on the sample of 135 university students from Slovakia using a sixcomponent behaviour explanation model. The results reveal that it still can be beneficial to include television advertisements in the communication mix aimed at these young consumers. The investments in TV advertising campaigns could pay off. The advertisers and their agencies should respect the role of high search visibility in this process. In this case, the messages contained in TV advertisements have the potential to influence the purchasing behaviour of young consumers. Thanks to achieving top ranking for the relevant brand, product, and campaignrelated keywords, communication campaigns can become truly integrated. Thus, the component of search visibility directly influences the efficiency of marketing communication, contributing to enhanced business performance. Suggestions towards the optimisation of the delivery of communication campaigns featuring TV advertising should target these consumers are presented based on the generated knowledge about their attitude towards and consumption of TV ads and subsequent behaviours.",,2020.0,53,2,0,True,Suggestions towards the optimisation of the delivery of communication campaigns featuring TV advertising should target these consumers are presented based on the generated knowledge about their attitude towards and consumption of TV ads and subsequent behaviours.,,,,,1035,67018933,Andrej Miklošík,117902331,P.

This study reports on a representative sample of nine representative students (out of 40 students at four universities). The researchers interviewed the students using open-ended questions. Interviews lasted from 20 to 30 minutes. Forty participants (20 males and 20 females) were interviewed. About 70% of the interviewees supposed that comments on accent implicated sociolinguistic prejudice. And only 30% did not believe that comments were subjective, and assumed that such comments do enhance the successful communication process by trying to accomplish using a homogenous accent that is appropriate for all students. The study shows students’ identities as associated with both institutional contexts and group affiliations. And the findings are discussed within Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner’s, 1986) and Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles 1980 and works after).",International journal of humanities and social sciences,2020.0,99,0,0,True,,,,,,1037,70506652,Wael Zuraiq,1410469282,Moh’d A.

Analyses of disclosure tend to focus on logistical acts and suggest that students are likely to ‘cover’ their disabilities in order to manage others’ perceptions of their capability. Using data from a grounded theory study conducted at four US medical schools, the article demonstrates how some medical students reveal their disability experiences for collective benefit and to counter stigma. These strategic acts, political disclosures, resist ableist conceptions of disability in medicine. Students described ways they disclosed politically, compelled by certain drivers: desiring belonging, connecting individual concerns to systemic problems, having certain individual attributes, and acquiring status. Against this, a sense of risk to future career and a lack of structural support hindered such acts. Structural measures to support positive identity development and address ableist culture are offered in response.",Disability & Society,2020.0,77,19,1,False,,,,,,1042,7205769,N.

1044,White Design: Engineering the Visualization of Race and Racism in Social Media,"This dissertation is a study on how social media platforms engineer whiteness as ideology and aesthetic. Where work in the field to this point has primarily emphasized the ways in which platforms reproduce ideologies like white supremacy, I demonstrate that the platform is itself a generative mechanism that has infrastructural connections to white supremacy in the form of shared mechanics, including identification, categorization, and interpellation. To advance this research, I conduct textual, visual, and design-based rhetorical analysis on three case study platforms: YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. From this work, I establish a theoretical framework combining visual culture studies, platform studies, and critical race studies. 
 
This research contributes to the field of media studies by reframing how race and platforms correlate. Platformization as a phenomenon brings about fundamentally distinct dynamics with regard to conceptualizations of white supremacy, prompting a reassessment of how the latter is commonly defined in critical race studies. This work also contributes to the ongoing development of media studies via its public-facing nature and investment in understanding new media through anti-racist theory. Because of the growth of public knowledge on how content platforms have ideological functions that align with existing biases, my research contributes new insight into both scholarly and popular discussions of the relationships between race and social media. 
 
The first chapter conceptualizes platform in theoretical relationship to race. Both platform and race are infrastructures that generate affect through interpellation. Belonging and loneliness are generated in the narratives that platforms produce as political power is given and denied based on the social construction of race. Chapters two, three, and four use case studies of social media platforms (YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram respectively) to demonstrate that there are always already design-based connections between platforms and the content that they host. Over the course of these chapters, I analyze media practices and objects that range across “passive” and “active” forms of engagement (from the acts of watching and searching to that of posting) and across moving and still images (from the formats of the video and GIF to the photograph).",,2020.0,0,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'pitt.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/38567/7/Cummings.pdf'}]",K Cummings - 2020 - d-scholarship.pitt.edu,,1044,49134726,Kelsey Cummings,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

1046,The inner world of Beethoven’s ninth symphony: Masculine and feminine?,"ABSTRACT In this paper, I explore the principal model within classical Western music, the sonata form, in terms of its gendered narratives. Susan McClary, an eminent American musicologist, started to do this in the 1980s as part of her forceful feminist critique of academic musicology and the music considered to be “great” within the Western classical music canon. She has been especially critical of much of Beethoven’s music, particularly the Ninth Symphony, which, along with other major works, she considers to be structured along patriarchal lines, actively if unconsciously promoting the values of patriarchy, overflowing with male violence and female subordination, its narrative primarily based on phallic sexuality. Her influence has been very considerable in musicology. I set out her case and critique it psychoanalytically, but in so doing I also set out my own theory of sonata form and Beethoven’s music as imbued with, and expressive of, a bisexual narrative. As Beethoven’s forceful masculinity has long been recognized, I particularly emphasize and illustrate his musical femininity. I also discuss and employ theories of countertransference and Oedipal configurations in relationship to Beethoven’s music in particular, and in general the links between Western classical music and the musicality of ordinary clinical psychoanalysis.",The International journal of psycho-analysis,2020.0,90,1,0,False,"This paper explores the principal model within classical Western music, the sonata form, in terms of its gendered narratives, and discusses and employs theories of countertransference and Oedipal configurations in relationship to Beethoven’s music in particular, and in general the links between Western classical music and the musicality of ordinary clinical psychoanalysis.",,,,,1046,4061871,F.

HIV testing is an important preventative step in the HIV continuum of care, however there is little known about HIV testing among these groups. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the HIV testing behaviors of Black transgender women and explore differences in predictors of HIV testing among Black cisgender and transgender women. This study uses secondary data from the 2014-2017 modules of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Analyses included multiple hierarchical regression. There are no major differences in HIV testing between Black cisgender and transgender women. A number of sociodemographic characteristics have been shown to predict HIV testing among Black cisgender women, but only employment status and age were significant predictors of HIV testing among Black transgender women. A moderation analysis suggested that gender identity significantly moderates the association between employment status and HIV testing such that the relationship between employment status and receiving an HIV test differs by gender identity. The findings of this study highlight nuances in HIV testing among Black cisgender and transgender women that are useful for improving HIV testing as a mode of HIV prevention. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of HIV testing practices among Black cisgender and transgender women.","Journal of healthcare, science and the humanities",2021.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,1052,2054333589,Jaleah D Rutledge,1399711811,Kaston D.

1058,The Berry dipole photovoltaic demon and the thermodynamics of photo-current generation within the optical gap of metals,"We dismantle the previously held misconception that it is impossible for bulk rectiﬁcation mechanisms to induce a net DC electric current when the frequency of the impinging radiation lies within the optical gap of a metal in the limit of small carrier relaxation rates. We argue that generically such in-gap rectiﬁcation mechanisms are irreversible and accompanied by a continuous exchange of energy with a heat bath and must also be necessarily accompanied by a small but ﬁnite absorption of radiation in order to guarantee the positivity of the net entropy production and abide by the second law of thermodynamics. We show, however, that the intra-band non-linear Hall eﬀect arising from the Berry curvature is a special kind of in-gap rectiﬁcation mechanism that behaves as a “photo-voltaic demon”, namely it can operate as an ideal reversible and dissipationless conveyor of energy between the radiation and an external circuit. Its reversible nature allows for an interesting mode of operation as an ampliﬁer of circularly polarized light, whose eﬃciency can approach 100%, and which could be technologically promising especially in the infrared frequency range.",,2022.0,50,8,1,False,,,,,,1058,152220163,Li-kun Shi,103205644,O.

1062,Holding bays or pathways: Vocationalism and physical recreation,"Accounts of vocational education suggest that it is classed and gendered. This is particularly so when the parent “industry” is heavily embodied (e.g. manual trades, physical recreation). In Queensland secondary schools, the Board of Senior Secondary School Studies is introducing the trialing of the Subject Area Specification in Physical Recreation (PR). This paper will report on how PR is positioned within the curriculum, which students are enrolled, and what sense students make of PR in terms of their ongoing experiences and post-school aspirations. Data are drawn from document analyses, in depth interviews, and observations of PR in two case study schools. Discourses surrounding governmentality, vocationalism, masculinities, and physicality are deconstructed to draw conclusions about the place of vocational education in young people’s lives. When referring to discussions of vocational education, we are reminded of the words of (Richards, 1962) who wrote: Our knowledge, if we allow it to be transformed within us, turns into capacity for lifeserving human deeds. If knowledge does not turn into life, it makes cripples and madmen and dunces. It poisons just as food would if it stayed in the stomach and was never digested, and the waste products never thrown off. (p. 16) Knowledge is a powerful tool, which can be used for many things. In the case of vocational education, it is argued that knowledge has been used to frame people as human capital (Knight, Lingard, & Porter, 1993). As such, vocational education historically has been considered as appropriate for the working class, immigrants and rural students; those deemed suited to technical and routine work to aid productivity (Rosenstock & Steinberg, 1999). More recently, economic reform in Australia and elsewhere, has broadened the remit of vocational education to now occupy an important role in senior schooling and the development of a skilled, certified, and flexible workforce. Physical education is one area of senior schooling that has been represented in a form of vocational education i.e. “Physical Recreation”. Other areas of senior schooling that have been configured as vocational education are Business, Tourism, Hospitality Practices, Industrial Skills, Computer Studies, English Communication, Trade and Business Mathematics, Literacy and Numeracy, and Land and Animal Systems. This study aims to investigate how students in two schools experienced the newly created Physical Recreation. As such it is a study of curriculum innovation, implementation, and evaluation. This paper firstly briefly critiques vocatio nal education before introducing the PR subject. It then details the research process and how the data were analysed by mapping out common themes that constitute key discourses of PR. We conclude that PR is place for “at risk boys” or elite athletes thereby reinforcing the claim that vocational education can be classed and gendered. Research in Vocational Education Research suggests that vocational education has not sufficiently met the educational needs of diverse and marginalized students (Angwin, 2000). Angwin (2000) found that: For many young people the transitional pathways out of school into work or VET are not clear in theory and are extremely complicated in practice...[as the] sector is made up of a complex mix of public and private provision, standards and accreditation systems of diverse locations, courses, teachers and status. (p. 96) While complex VET systems have emerged, at the same time there has been an increase in part-time work and a decline of fulltime work or in career opportunities for the youth labour market (Sweet, 1998). Especially hurt by these trends are students from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. As results show, low SES students tend to leave school early, “select school subjects, subject clusters and post-school education and training that largely lead them towards low SES employment; and many more of them have lower school achievement” (Collins, Kenway, McLeod, & Australia. Dept. of Education Training and Youth Affairs, 2000, p. 7-8). Fullarton (2001) stated that: Of the students who did not do VET in Schools, 28 per cent of those from lower socio-economic levels were at university in 1999 compared to 39 per cent of those from higher socio-economic backgrounds. Of those students who participated in VET in Schools, 8 per cent from the lower socio -economic parental backgrounds compared to 17 per cent from the higher socio -economic backgrounds were enrolled at university. The outcomes were similar for the 2000 data. (p. 43) Furthermore, it is claimed that vocational education has been structured for men rather than for women (Kenway, Junor, & Willis, 1995). Apprenticeships show the greatest imbalances for gender as Fullarton (2001) documented: More noticeable is that there are marked gender differences in the rates of participation in apprenticeships: for those who completed VET in Schools in either Year 11 or Year 12 the rate for males is 15 per cent, that for females 1 per cent. For those young people who competed two years of VET in Schools the rate for males is 14 per cent and for females 2 per cent, while those with no VET in Schools the participation rate for males is 6 per cent and for females 1 per cent. (p. 31) With these concerns in mind, we were interested in questions of class, gender, and life chances with respect to the implementation of PR in Queensland schools. Which students are interested in PR? Why? What is the explicit and hidden curriculum of PR? How do they perceive PR? What is the nature of interactions in PR? Does PR meet their needs? The following section outlines the genesis of PR and key frameworks in the PR document that gives a backdrop to these questions. Physical Recreation During the early 1990s, three reports (by Finn, Carmichael, and Mayer) underpinned the creation of the Australian Vocational Certificate Training System which allows students to receive cross-certification between schools, TAFE, and industry (Carmichael & Employment and Skills Formation Council, 1992). As part of this system, the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) writes National Training Packages wich in turn provide guidelines for school-based iterations of vocational education. In Queensland these documents are called Study Area Specifications (SAS). SAS subjects have units of competency and levels of achievements recorded on the Senior Certificate, but the SAS subjects, unlike mainstream Board of Senior Secondary School Studies (QBSSSS) subjects, do not count towards the calculation of Overall Position scores and Field Positions used for university entrance (QBSSSS, 2001a). In 1999, under the auspices of the QBSSSS, the Health and Physical Education Review Officer, outdoor training specialists, physical education specialists, and a parent representative worked with the National Training Package to write the PR document for Queensland schools. PR has been in open trial over the last two years. The document divides PR into three strands that are designed to give flexibility to schools. Integrated within each strand is a Study Area Core of 15 hours study on the effects of recreation on individuals and on communities, the role of physical activity in maintaining good health, strategies to promote safety, and personal and interpersonal skills to achieve goals. There are also integrated units of work within each of the three strands that include four main aspects of a recreation pursuit: these are recreation and you, physical activity and healthy lifestyle, safety, risk awareness and health concerns, and interpersonal and group dynamics. In Strand A, Recreation Practices presents students with the opportunity to gain a Certificate I in either administration or coaching and instruction. The students have to complete a set number of hours and modules to obtain the Certificate I (QBSSSS, 1999). Some activities involve students teaching sports such as bowling, volleyball, and touch to the class and participating and being assessed in games. In Strand B, Recreation Studies, the students receive a Certificate of Attainment with a list of modules from the Certificate I in Recreation Practices (see Figure 1) (QBSSSS, 1999). Students in Recreation Studies spend at least 50% of the class time developing an appropriate physique or fitness level in one to six recreational pursuits. Activities in Recreation Studies involve setting up a tennis tournament for younger students or developing a personal fitness program to improve their performance in a particular sport or physical activity. In Strand C, Recreation Pursuits, the Certificate I or Certificate of Attainment is not an outcome (see Figure 1). The purpose here is to simply get students active or exposed to PR. For example, students play games such as cricket, volleyball, and tennis.",,2001.0,37,2,0,False,,,,,,1062,34564362,D. Macdonald,7463442,Seth Brown,,,,,,,,,Engineering,Review
1063,"Regrounding the commons: Bruno Latour, ecological democracy, and nonhuman political representation","What is the relationship between science and politics, and especially as it concerns the entities of the sciences and the relevance they have in political processes? In the following thesis, I look to form proper political institutions around nonhuman entities through the work of Bruno Latour and his democratic-ecological ethos by way of his 2004 text the Politics of Nature: How to Bring the Sciences into Democracy. In recognition of mass species extinction, the fragility of our soil, the warming climate, the rise of automation, the importance of carbon sequestration, and the various socio-economic problems attached to the environment—what is called political ecology—the old binary of science and politics as opposed, as one discipline concerned with technology and natural objects (science), and the other concerned with humans (politics), is becoming less and less tenable as we become more sensitive and inundated with the aforementioned issues. 
With the guidance of the sociologist of science Bruno Latour, these essays attempt to use Latour's framework of a technoscientific political process, plus an expanded sense of spokespersonship as representative institutions for nonhumans. In establishing these processes and institutions, I hope to help orient how we should understand our past failures in improper recognition of nonhumans, and how it is we can better bring nonhumans into democracy through the aid of Latour. By redefining politics as the issues that bring about a concerned public, Latour also looks to include nonhumans as a part of the public. Nonhumans as a public is one of the significant points through these pages. 
I hope to accomplish three things in this thesis. 1. Contribute to Latourian scholarship by providing exegesis around his 2004 text The Politics of Nature. 2. In doing this, I hope to better situate the current political ecology movements, as seen by a premier thinker concerned with climate change and the Anthropocene. In relation to that contribution, I would like to further establish Bruno Latour as a political theorist with a political philosophy that is worth examining. At the end of this work, I provide my own philosophic contribution in shaping policy and existing institutions in a warming and sea-rising technological future by the aid of Latour's institutional vision from the Politics of Nature. The reader will have to reconsider how they view politics, who the constituents are, and whom the ""we"" are when talking about a common world ""we"" would like to share. Arguably, the most radical vision for democratic politics in the 21st century is to include those things humans have historically tried to subjugate as mere objects, or the materials of Nature, or the work of social construction. The next step in the democratic project is to include the entities that without human subsistence would be futile: it is time to recognize multi-species living, the collaboration between nonhumans for the sake of human flourishing, and the work that politics can do in organizing a sense of commonality.",,2020.0,0,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'mun.ca', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://research.library.mun.ca/14311/1/thesis.pdf'}]",A Ahern - 2020 - research.library.mun.ca,,1063,1572232937,A.

1065,The Case For Animal Protection Curricula in Schools in Hong Kong,"In a city like Hong Kong where animal protection laws replicate outdated British legislation from the early 1900s, extensive educational measures must be taken to raise students’ collective awareness of animal welfare and rights, in order to meet the pressing environmental, social, and moral demands of a rapidly developing society. This article argues that the study of animal protection in Hong Kong school curricula is essential to raising future generations of responsible and empathetic community leaders and members. Not only can such curricula encourage students to make well-informed, healthy, and environmentally-conscious choices as consumers, it also challenges the speciesist “hidden curricula” perpetuated in schools, developing students’ critical and independent thinking skills and empowering them to regain ownership over and accountability for their decisions. It instils empathy in students towards animals, as well as vulnerable groups in society that share a similar narrative of oppression and exploitation, such as women and ethnic minorities. This article refutes the critique of animal protection curricula being a form of indoctrination by challenging the notion that any education system can be truly value-free.",,2020.0,42,0,0,True,,,,,,1065,1579700574,C.

College and University students are at particular risk of mental and behavioral health issues due to the social distancing, stay at home orders and the abrupt shift from face-to-face to online learning. This study aimed to determine the impact that stay at home orders have on health behaviors such as mental health, physical activity, screen-time, and alcohol consumption have on social work students. Results indicated a statistically significant increase in anxiety and depression scores during the pandemic as compared to prior to the pandemic. In addition, there was a significant increase in screen time during pandemic as compared with prior to pandemic. The results of this study suggest a need for increased support for student during social distancing and stay at home orders.

1070,Current developments of intensive pulsed light treatment for dry eye disease and meibomian gland dysfunction,"ABSTRACT Introduction : Dry eye disease (DED) associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is one of the most frequent eye diseases, with a prevalence from 10% of the Western population to 70% in Asian countries. Today there is no fully effective treatment and alternatives such as intensive pulsed light (IPL) are being sought. The results with IPL highlights show subjective improvement of the patients when the treatment is carried out with four sessions and with parameters adapted to ophthalmological use. Most studies show improvement in 80–90% of the cases. Regarding the mechanisms of action, there are several possible effects of IPL and the most of them have a common denominator, the reduction of inflammation on ocular surface and around the meibomian glands, favoring tissues regeneration and neuro-trophism who are responsible for the improvement reported by patients. Areas covered : We analyze possible mechanisms of action of IPL such as the importance of the parameters used for ophthalmological use. Expert opinion: Still having doubts about the exact mechanism of IPL action, the good clinical results obtained (efficacy and safety) encourage us to think that the incorporation of this new technology can help to improve these patients especially the symptoms they suffer.",Expert Review of Ophthalmology,2021.0,121,3,0,False,The good clinical results obtained (efficacy and safety) encourage us to think that the incorporation of this new technology can help to improve these patients especially the symptoms they suffer.,,,,,1070,11344142,C.

1072,"How Do Mental Health Practitioners Consider and Understand Identities, Beliefs and Practices That Are Associated With Islam When Encountered in Clinical Practice","Islam is a growing religion in the UK, however it is also highly politicised and marginalised, as highlighted by the increasing Islamophobia in social and political discourses seen in the West. Discrimination and social inequalities affect Muslim groups in the UK, both of which are shown to have a negative impact on mental health and wellbeing. However, access to inclusive, culturally and religiously sensitive mental health care appears to limit Muslim populations from receiving appropriate mental health support. 
Some research has importantly considered Muslim service users’ experiences of mental health services and found that mainstream mental health care may not respond appropriately to their religious or cultural needs. Furthermore, experiences of stereotyping and discrimination from professionals were noted. However, ideas about stigma or other ‘cultural’ barriers to accessing help appear to dominate professional ideas about low access rates. 
This research sought to explore the way that mental health professionals construct Islam and whether these go on to impact professionals’ judgements and clinical decisions in their contact with Muslim service users. 
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 mental health professionals based in the UK. These findings highlighted the way that religious and cultural unfamiliarity with Islam and the prevailing Islamophobic and Orientalist discourses available in the West may affect professionals’ perceptions about Muslim service users and lead to decisions about care which exclude or overlook their needs. The implicit prioritisation of Western mental health frameworks was also seen to lead to the discrediting or problematising of different cultural or religious understandings of distress. 
However, examples of practice which attempted to reduce this epistemic inequality and adapt interventions to be more in line with Muslim service users’ frameworks were highlighted as having fostered improved relationships with Muslim service users, families and communities. The implications of these findings are discussed.",,2020.0,0,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'uel.ac.uk', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://repository.uel.ac.uk/download/7e17185753292f46b36381ddf9148c037c27ffa28af3f45d116d8d35b5d9d027/1435833/2020_ClinPsychD_Al-Alaway.pdf'}]",S Al-Alaway - 2020 - repository.uel.ac.uk,"[{'name': 'S Al-Alaway', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T5VZ2CAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=T5VZ2CAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'T5VZ2CAAAAAJ'}]",1072,2101233194,S.

1074,Consumption and the Rhetorics of Need and Want,"Both academic and popular discussion of consumption tend to centre around two dominant discourses or rhetorics. These are those of need (satisfaction) and want (desire). These rhetorics relate to contrasting models of human action with associated ideologies. The need rhetoric has its origin in a Puritan-inspired utilitarian philosophy of comfort and satisfaction, while the want or desire rhetoric has its origin in a Romantic-inspired philosophy of pleasure-seeking. Although both ideologies and their associated rhetorics are institutionalized in contemporary society, it is the former that tends to have greater legitimacy. This paper looks at the various relationships which it has been suggested exist between these two rhetorics in theories of consumption, examining these as they have been represented historically, bio-psychologically and sociologically. Finally, materialfrom the author's current research on shopping is used to demonstrate how these two rhetorics are related to gender roles, as well as employed by individuals to help them accomplish their consumption goals.",Consumption and Consumer Society,2021.0,1,38,3,False,,,,,,1074,49926416,C.

Using cross-disciplinary methods, it examines the interplay that occurs between the layers of the computational stack – focusing in particular on the slippage between materiality, code, interface, and the resulting software – and analyzes the narratives that each layer perpetuates individually and in tandem. It applies a multi-faceted approach to queer theory in order to reveal the ways in which anti-normative computer users critique, resist, and subvert these narratives. When computers are approached as always already queer, the possibilities for disruption that exist within their limits materialize and present themselves as opportunities for intersectional exploitation.

1076,"Gender Differences in Generating Cognitive Reappraisals for Threatening Situations: Reappraisal Capacity Shields Against Depressive Symptoms in Men, but Not Women","Despite major research interest regarding gender differences in emotion regulation, it is still not clear whether men and women differ in their basic capacity to implement specific emotion regulation strategies, as opposed to indications of the habitual use of these strategies in self-reports. Similarly, little is known on how such basic capacities relate to indices of well-being in both sexes. This study took a novel approach by investigating gender differences in the capacity for generating cognitive reappraisals in adverse situations in a sample of 67 female and 59 male students, using a maximum performance test of the inventiveness in generating reappraisals. Participants’ self-perceived efficacy in emotion regulation was additionally assessed. Analyses showed that men and women did not differ in their basic capacity to generate alternative appraisals for anxiety-eliciting scenarios, suggesting similar functional cognitive mechanisms in the implementation of this strategy.

1078,Operational Challenges in Servicizing the Transportation Industry,"As a result of declining consumer spending, more companies have been “servicizing” their business models, moving away from the typical product-centric model and offering their goods as services. This trend has been especially popular in the transportation industry, with cars and scooters now being rented by the minute, with no transfer of ownership. Apps like Uber and Lyft have disrupted the taxi service industry, effectively side-stepping expensive regulations due to their “car-sharing” business model. While this money-saving distinction has led to their success, it can also lead to their downfall, as they face many legal battles specific to ride-sharing services. Similar companies, like Zagster and Zipcar, allow customers to pick-up a bike or a car near them and pay per hour. The success of these companies depends on their efficient inventory management and the ability to meet fluctuating demand. Following a similar business model, but in a market of its own, Zapp Ride Share has emerged on the USC college campus, to allow students to rent scooters and pay by the minute. After testing the market with a company known as Scootaway, the CEO, Frank Scozzafava, fixed the major operational issues and relaunched this concept under a new name. Although the scooterrental idea has been met with success so far, it still faces challenges similar to those of car-sharing and bike-sharing companies. Threats to the company’s operations include legal issues, matching supply with demand, and competing for market share. SERVICIZING TRANSPORTATION 4 CHAPTER ONE Introduction to Servicizing On average, a power-tool only gets 30 minutes of use in its lifetime (Baker, 2006), which poses the question: does every household really need a power-tool? They technically only need the hole that the drill would create, not the actual product. Using online platforms like SnapGoods and NeighborGoods, paying to use the power-tool on a need-be basis would be much more costeffective in this scenario. Product ownership has become less important, with as much as 43% of consumers agreeing that “owning today feels like a burden,” resulting in a 2.4% decline in U.S. consumer spending on durable goods in January 2017, compared to January 2016 (The Sharing Economy: Consumer Intelligence Series, 2015; Hoover’s Inc., 2017). As a result of this consumer behavior, companies are turning the threat of decreased spending into an opportunity, by “servicizing” their business models. In other words, companies are offering their products as services for rent, by the minute or by the mile, capitalizing on the need that the product itself represents (Rothenberg, 2007). In 2015, 21.7 million Americans were using sharing economy services like AirBnB and Curtsy, with 2020 forecasts as high as 40 million users (“Sharing Economy: Number of Users U.S. 2014-2020”). This product-sharing revolution has been growing in popularity on an international scale, as well, with bicycle repair and gardening services in the Netherlands, grocery delivery in Vienna and household appliance rentals in Helsinki (Baker, 2006). CHAPTER 2 The Car-Sharing Revolution The transportation industry has drastically redefined this consumer-object relationship, with companies like NetJet allowing customers to rent a jet by the hour, and many major cities adopting SERVICIZING TRANSPORTATION 5 an hourly bike-rental program. This focus on a product’s usage is especially beneficial in the car industry, with the burden and cost of ownership so high and the average utilization so low; private vehicles sit unused approximately 95% of the time (Leiber, 2016). Counter this low utilization with average monthly costs that include gas, a parking pass & lease payments, it makes sense to eliminate cost of ownership and pay per mile instead. Consumers agree with this logic; in fact, 81% of sharedeconomy users say that product-sharing is a less expensive alternative to product ownership (“The Sharing Economy: Consumer Intelligence Series”, 2015). Along with being economical, 83% also agree it’s a more convenient and efficient transportation option (“The Sharing Economy: Consumer Intelligence Series”, 2015). This trend has been growing in popularity in the U.S., with 8% of adults participating in the car-sharing industry and choosing mobility rather than ownership (“The Sharing Economy: Consumer Intelligence Series”, 2015). On a global scale, revenue from the car-sharing industry reached $1.1 billion in 2015, and is forecasted to grow to $6.5 billion in 2024 (Leiber, 2016). UBER: A New Ride-hailing Concept A major player in the car-sharing industry is Uber, a ride-hailing app founded by Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick in 2009. As of 2016, the company was valued at $68 billion, with 1.5 million drivers, in 450 cities across 73 countries. 40 million people will order an Uber each month, totaling around 1.2 billion miles, which shows how high the demand is for ride-sharing, as well as the market potential (Helft et al, 2016). The Uber app is user-friendly and reliable; after registering your payment information, each ride is just a couple clicks away. After plugging in pick-up location and destination, the app searches for drivers in the area, lets the user know the price beforehand, and just requires simple confirmation. A driver is then selected and pulls up to the location, which is more efficient than the customer having to find a free cab driving past in a crowded urban population. Uber also has a SERVICIZING TRANSPORTATION 6 feature that shows the user the driver’s information, including their name, phone number & license plate, with a “Report Driver” comment section in case of emergencies (Helft, et al, 2016). When comparing the sharing economy to the traditional taxi model, a recent study found that app-based transportation services offer “more ‘mobility,’ in fewer vehicles and miles, and that app-users waited shorter periods for their ride” (Elliott, 2016). This ease of use has greatly contributed to the rising popularity of these ride-hailing apps. The premise of Uber’s business model is making the most of excess capacity. The drivers that work for Uber use their own cars, which they have to get cleared by the company beforehand. The driver is making use of his downtime, and increasing the utilization of his/her own car that would’ve just been sitting in the driveway. Taking advantage of existing, paid-off assets, Uber avoids the burden and cost of owning a car, by simply employing its drivers. Due to this difference from taxi services, Uber is able to avoid strict regulations and pricing guidelines that taxis abide by. Taxis must own expensive medallion licenses, which are very limited in number, and must also follow strict regulations when it comes to the taxi car itself (Mohammed, 2014). This “expense of compliance” can account for 35-40% of operational costs for a taxi company (Elliott, 2016). The price that taxis charge customers is also set by local regulators, a fixed one-size-fits-all rate by the mile. Uber is at an advantage here, because the company can charge higher prices during peak times, or discount prices to maintain market share in highly populated areas like New York City (Mohammed, 2014). Many have criticized this undercutting and sidestepping of government regulations, leading to protests in many countries, including Chile, Argentina, France & South Africa (Bacon, 2015). While Uber has this advantage over highly-regulated taxi companies, it has been struggling to keep its market share with Lyft, another ride-sharing app outside the taxi service classification. Since both companies can legally set their own prices, they have been competing for market share in major SERVICIZING TRANSPORTATION 7 cities, like San Francisco and New York City, through a price war. In January of last year, Uber announced lower fares to compete with its rival, which ranged from ten to forty-five percent discounts in one hundred North American cities. In the same month, Lyft responded with a similar slash in prices in thirty-three markets. Small profit margins, as a result of price-matching with the competition, make it difficult to sustain any costly projects, such as app updates and geographic expansion. Although the companies try to subsidize these fare cuts with funding—$2 billion total for Lyft and $10 billion for Uber, as of last year—the impact of large investments and competitive pricing is evident in the balance sheets. For example, in 2015, Uber invested a lot of time and money into expanding into China, India and Southeast Asia. This investment, paired with price cuts, resulted in tremendous losses, as shown in Figure 1. Cumulatively, Uber lost $1.7 billion on $1.2 billion in revenue over the first three quarters of 2015. By lowering its prices in major cities, and spending large sums to enter new markets, ridehailing companies such as Uber and Lyft must often sacrifice profits for growth (Newcomer and Huet, 2016). This borderline predatory pricing has also led to many legal battles recently that threaten Uber & Lyft’s distinction from the “taxi service” rules and regulations. Most cases and complaints are on the basis of the Federal Trade Commission Act, claiming that Uber and Lyft have created an Figure 1. Uber's Growing Global Revenue (and Losses). Source: Bloomberg (Newcomer and Huet) SERVICIZING TRANSPORTATION 8 anticompetitive market, by being held to different standards than the taxis. Taxi companies can’t compete with market prices when so much overhead cost is unique to only their company. Government systems, at the city, state and national level, have been responding to these complaints with action as severe as banning operations altogether. For example, Nevada was the first state to ban Uber drivers statewide, only to repeal this decision later. Virginia requires that rideshare apps have a transportation broker license, comply with tax laws, keep rates transparent, and advertise the driver’s in",,2017.0,24,0,0,False,,,,,,1078,1516617662,K.

1080,Confronting Abusive Language Online: A Survey from the Ethical and Human Rights Perspective,"The pervasiveness of abusive content on the internet can lead to severe psychological and physical harm. Significant effort in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has been devoted to addressing this problem through abusive content detection and related sub-areas, such as the detection of hate speech, toxicity, cyberbullying, etc. Although current technologies achieve high classification performance in research studies, it has been observed that the real-life application of this technology can cause unintended harms, such as the silencing of under-represented groups. We review a large body of NLP research on automatic abuse detection with a new focus on ethical challenges, organized around eight established ethical principles: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. In many cases, these principles relate not only to situational ethical codes, which may be context-dependent, but are in fact connected to universal human rights, such as the right to privacy, freedom from discrimination, and freedom of expression. We highlight the need to examine the broad social impacts of this technology, and to bring ethical and human rights considerations to every stage of the application life-cycle, from task formulation and dataset design, to model training and evaluation, to application deployment. Guided by these principles, we identify several opportunities for rights-respecting, socio-technical solutions to detect and confront online abuse, including ‘nudging’, ‘quarantining’, value sensitive design, counter-narratives, style transfer, and AI-driven public education applications.evaluation, to application deployment.

1082,Automatic Sexism Detection with Multilingual Transformer Models,". Sexism has become an increasingly signiﬁcant problem on social networks in recent years. The ﬁrst shared task on sEXism Identiﬁcation in Social neTworks (EXIST) at IberLEF 2021 is an international competition in the ﬁeld of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the aim to automatically identify sexism in social media content by applying machine learning methods. Thereby sexism detection is formulated as a coarse (binary) classiﬁcation problem and a ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation task that distinguishes multiple types of sexist content (e.g., dominance, stereotyping, and objectiﬁcation). This paper presents the contribution of the AIT FHSTP team at the EXIST2021 benchmark for both tasks. To solve the task,s we applied two multilingual transformer models, one based on multilingual BERT and one based on XLM-R. Our approach uses two diﬀerent strategies to adapt the transformers to the detection of sexist content: ﬁrst, unsupervised pre-training with additional data and second, supervised ﬁne-tuning with additional and augmented data. For both tasks our best model is XLM-R with unsupervised pre-training on the EXIST data and additional datasets and ﬁne-tuning on the provided dataset. The best run for the binary classiﬁcation (task 1) achieves a macro F1-score of 0.7752 and scores 5 th rank in the benchmark; for the multiclass classiﬁcation (task 2) our best submission scores 6 th rank with a macro F1-score of 0.5589.",ArXiv,2021.0,16,5,0,False,"The contribution of the AIT FHSTP team at the EXIST2021 benchmark for both tasks is presented, with the best model is XLM-R with unsupervised pre-training on the EXist data and additional datasets and ﬁne-tuning on the provided dataset.",,,,,1082,2051453710,Mina Schütz,2112477139,Jaqueline Boeck,2112707326,Daria Liakhovets,31522269,D.

1092,Impact of SMOTE on Imbalanced Text Features for Toxic Comments Classification Using RVVC Model,"Social media platforms and microblogging websites have gained accelerated popularity during the past few years. These platforms are used for expressing views and opinions about products, personalities, and events. Often during discussions and debates, fights take place on social media platforms which involves using rude, disrespectful, and hateful comments called toxic comments. The identification of toxic comments has been regarded as an essential element for social media platforms. This study introduces an ensemble approach, called regression vector voting classifier (RVVC), to identify the toxic comments on social media platforms. The ensemble merges the logistic regression and support vector classifier under soft voting criteria. Several experiments are performed on the imbalanced and balanced dataset to analyze the performance of the proposed approach. For data balance, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is used on the imbalanced dataset. Furthermore, two feature extraction approaches are utilized to investigate their suitability such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and bag-of-words (BoW). The performance of the proposed approach is compared with several machine learning classifiers using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results suggest that RVVC outperforms all other individual models when TF-IDF features are used with SMOTE balanced dataset and achieves an accuracy of 0.97.",IEEE Access,2021.0,49,43,0,True,"An ensemble approach, called regression vector voting classifier (RVVC), is introduced to identify the toxic comments on social media platforms to suggest that RVVC outperforms all other individual models when TF-IDF features are used with SMOTE balanced dataset and achieves an accuracy of 0.97.",,,,,1092,,Vaibhav Rupapara,1430656665,Furqan Rustam,2106697412,H.

1094,FairShades: Fairness Auditing via Explainability in Abusive Language Detection Systems,"At every stage of a supervised learning process, harmful biases can arise and be inadvertently introduced, ul-timately leading to marginalization, discrimination, and abuse towards minorities. This phenomenon becomes particularly im-pactful in the sensitive real-world context of abusive language detection systems, where non-discrimination is difficult to assess. In addition, given the opaqueness of their internal behavior, the dynamics leading a model to a certain decision are often not clear nor accountable, and significant problems of trust could emerge. A robust value-oriented evaluation of models' fairness is therefore necessary. In this paper, we present FairShades, a model-agnostic approach for auditing the outcomes of abusive language detection systems. Combining explainability and fairness evaluation, Fair-Shades can identify unintended biases and sensitive categories towards which models are most discriminative. This objective is pursued through the auditing of meaningful counterfactuals generated within CheckList framework.

1096,Sentiment Polarization in Online Social Networks: The Flow of Hate Speech,"The influence of sentiment polarization and ex-change in online social networks has been growing and studied by many researchers and organizations worldwide. For example, the sentiments expressed in a text concerning a topic in the discussion tend to influence a community when a Twitter user retweets the original text, causing a chain of reactions within a network. This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo. Specifically, we collect the tweets mentioned above and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral. In this context, we address the problem as a multiclass classification problem by using the pre-trained language models ULMFiT and AWD-LSTM, which achieved a Fmicro of 0.85. Finally, we use the classified dataset to conduct a case study in which we capture the sentiment orientation during the network evolution.","International Conference on Social Networks Analysis, Management and Security",2021.0,42,0,0,False,"This paper investigates sentiment polarization in Twitter, focusing on tweets with the hashtags #Coronavirus, #ClimateChange #Immigrants, and #MeToo, and classify them into five categories: hate speech, offensive, sexism, positive, and neutral.",,,"K Katsarou, S Sunder, V Woloszyn… - … Conference on Social …, 2021 - ieeexplore.ieee.org","[{'name': 'K Katsarou', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U7j9c6cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=U7j9c6cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'U7j9c6cAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'V Woloszyn', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xN4b2pIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=xN4b2pIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'xN4b2pIAAAAJ'}]",1096,2545574,K.

1098,Normalizing misogyny: hate speech and verbal abuse of female politicians on Japanese Twitter,"Abstract Social media platforms such as Twitter have gained tremendous political importance in recent years. Moreover, being considered as platforms for organizing grass root political movements or political participation in general, this positive view has given way to more critical perspectives on the negative sides of social media, such as attempts of algorithmically manipulating public opinion or the outcome of elections and racist or sexist hate speech. For the case of Japan, despite particularly xenophobic hate speech on bulletin boards such as “2channel” (ni-channeru) or Twitter has been extensively studied from various angles, misogynic forms of verbal abuse towards females on social media, female politicians in particular, have received much lesser attention in existing research. In this article we present results from an explorative analysis of instances of misogynist or sexist hate speech and abusive language against female politicians on Twitter, applying computational corpus-linguistic tools and methods, supplemented by a qualitative in-depth study of verbal abuse of four prominent female politicians, namely Renhō, Tsujimoto Kiyomi, Yamao Shiori, and Koike Yuriko, thereby fruitfully combining quantitative-statistical and qualitative-hermeneutic approaches.",Japan forum,2020.0,101,16,1,False,,,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/61731978/Normalizing_misogyny_hate_speech_and_verbal_abuse_of_female_politicians_on_Japanese_Twitter20200109-105913-1lnfz4s.pdf'}]","T Fuchs, F Schäfer - Japan forum, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'F Schäfer', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=allMynMAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=allMynMAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'allMynMAAAAJ'}]",1098,2062282626,T.

1101,How Does Counterfactually Augmented Data Impact Models for Social Computing Constructs?,"As NLP models are increasingly deployed in socially situated settings such as online abusive content detection, it is crucial to ensure that these models are robust. One way of improving model robustness is to generate counterfactually augmented data (CAD) for training models that can better learn to distinguish between core features and data artifacts. While models trained on this type of data have shown promising out-of-domain generalizability, it is still unclear what the sources of such improvements are. We investigate the benefits of CAD for social NLP models by focusing on three social computing constructs — sentiment, sexism, and hate speech. Assessing the performance of models trained with and without CAD across different types of datasets, we find that while models trained on CAD show lower in-domain performance, they generalize better out-of-domain. We unpack this apparent discrepancy using machine explanations and find that CAD reduces model reliance on spurious features. Leveraging a novel typology of CAD to analyze their relationship with model performance, we find that CAD which acts on the construct directly or a diverse set of CAD leads to higher performance.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2021.0,59,14,2,True,"This work investigates the benefits of counterfactually augmented data (CAD) for social NLP models by focusing on three social computing constructs — sentiment, sexism, and hate speech, and finds that CAD reduces model reliance on spurious features.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07022'}]","I Sen, M Samory, F Flöck, C Wagner… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2021 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'I Sen', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qXzr-p8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=qXzr-p8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'qXzr-p8AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Samory', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m5hUWjsAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=m5hUWjsAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'm5hUWjsAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'F Flöck', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xLFyzlMAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=xLFyzlMAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'xLFyzlMAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'C Wagner', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R5-PPJQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=R5-PPJQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'R5-PPJQAAAAJ'}]",1101,33770417,Indira Sen,3071381,Mattia Samory,1724463,Fabian Flöck,144065562,Claudia Wagner,49757932,I.

1102,Whose Opinions Matter? Perspective-aware Models to Identify Opinions of Hate Speech Victims in Abusive Language Detection,"Social media platforms provide users the freedom of expression and a medium to exchange information and express diverse opinions. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in the growth of abusive content with the purpose of discriminating people and targeting the most vulnerable communities such as immigrants, LGBT, Muslims, Jews and women. Because abusive language is subjective in nature, there might be highly polarizing topics or events involved in the annotation of abusive contents such as hate speech (HS). Therefore, we need novel approaches to model conflicting perspectives and opinions coming from people with different personal and demographic backgrounds. In this paper, we present an in-depth study to model polarized opinions coming from different communities under the hypothesis that similar characteristics (ethnicity, social background, culture etc.) can influence the perspectives of annotators on a certain phenomenon. We believe that by relying on this information, we can divide the annotators into groups sharing similar perspectives. We can create separate gold standards, one for each group, to train state-of-the-art deep learning models. We can employ an ensemble approach to combine the perspective-aware classifiers from different groups to an inclusive model. We also propose a novel resource, a multi-perspective English language dataset annotated according to different sub-categories relevant for characterising online abuse: hate speech, aggressiveness, offensiveness and stereotype. Unlike our previous work, where the annotations were based on crowd-sourcing, here, we involved the victims of targeted communities in the annotation process, who volunteered to annotate the dataset, providing a natural selection of the annotator groups based on their personal characteristics. By training state-of-the-art deep learning models on this novel resource, we show how our approach improves the prediction performance of a state-of-the-art supervised classifier. Moreover, we also perform an in-depth qualitative analysis of the novel dataset to identify and understand the relevant keywords, topics and events causing polarization among the annotators in expressed opinions.",ArXiv,2021.0,55,11,2,False,"An in-depth study to model polarized opinions coming from different communities under the hypothesis that similar characteristics can influence the perspectives of annotators on a certain phenomenon, and how this approach improves the prediction performance of a state-of-the-art supervised classifier.",,,,,1102,49181304,S.

Although this particular form of oppressive speech is banned and punished on most social networks, its identification is quite challenging due to the large number of messages posted everyday. Moreover, sexist comments can be unnoticed as condescends or friendly statements which hinders its identification even for humans. With the aim of improving automatic sexist identification on social networks, we participate in EXIST-2021. This shared task involves the identification and categorisation of sexism language on Spanish and English documents compiled from micro-blogging platforms. Specifically, two tasks were proposed, one concerning a binary classification of sexism utterances and another regarding multi-class identification of sexist traits. Our proposal for solving both tasks is grounded on the combination of linguistic features and state-of-the-art transformers by means of ensembles and multi-input neural networks. To address the multi-language problem, we tackle the problem independently by language to put the results together at the end. Our best result was achieved in task 1 with an accuracy of 75.14% and 61.70% for task 2.",IberLEF@SEPLN,2021.0,13,1,0,False,"A binary classification of sexism utterances and another regarding multi-class identification of sexist traits are proposed, grounded on the combination of linguistic features and state-of-the-art transformers by means of ensembles and multi-input neural networks.",,"[{'title': 'unit.no', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://hiof.brage.unit.no/hiof-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2831044/Colomo-PalaciosSexist2021.pdf?sequence=2'}]","JA García-Díaz, R Colomo-Palacios, R Valencia-García - 2021 - hiof.brage.unit.no","[{'name': 'JA García-Díaz', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ek7NIYUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=ek7NIYUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'ek7NIYUAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'R Colomo-Palacios', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CpqizXUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=CpqizXUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'CpqizXUAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'R Valencia-García', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GLpBPNMAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=GLpBPNMAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'GLpBPNMAAAAJ'}]",1107,1409250207,J.

1109,"SS-BERT: Mitigating Identity Terms Bias in Toxic Comment Classification by Utilising the Notion of ""Subjectivity"" and ""Identity Terms""","Toxic comment classification models are often found biased toward identity terms which are terms characterising a specific group of people such as “Muslim” and “black”. Such bias is commonly reflected in false positive predictions, i.e. non-toxic comments with identity terms. In this work, we propose a novel approach to tackle such bias in toxic comment classification, leveraging the notion of subjectivity level of a comment and the presence of identity terms. We hypothesize that when a comment is made about a group of people that is characterised by an identity term, the likelihood of that comment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment, i.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions. Building upon the BERT model, we propose a new structure that is able to leverage these features, and thoroughly evaluate our model on 4 datasets of varying sizes and representing different social media platforms. The results show that our model can consistently outperform BERT and a SOTA model devised to address identity term bias in a different way, with a maximum improvement in F1 of 2.43% and 1.91% respectively.",ArXiv,2021.0,34,2,0,False,"This work hypothesize that when a comment is made about a group of people that is characterised by an identity term, the likelihood of that comment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment, i.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions.",,,,,1109,2146630592,Zhixue Zhao,2046811422,Ziqi Zhang,1759761,F.

1110,An Information Retrieval Approach to Building Datasets for Hate Speech Detection,"Building a benchmark dataset for hate speech detection presents several challenges. Firstly, because hate speech is relatively rare – e.g., less than 3% of Twitter posts are hateful [14] – random sampling of tweets to annotate is inefficient in capturing hate speech. A common practice is to only annotate tweets containing known “hate words”, but this risks yielding a biased benchmark that only partially captures the real-world phenomenon of interest. A second challenge is that definitions of hate speech tend to be highly variable and subjective. Annotators having diverse prior notions of hate speech may not only disagree with one another but also struggle to conform to specified labeling guidelines. Our key insight is that the rarity and subjectivity of hate speech are akin to that of relevance in information retrieval (IR) [38]. This connection suggests that well-established methodologies for creating IR test collections might also be usefully applied to create better benchmark datasets for hate speech detection. Firstly, to intelligently and efficiently select which tweets to annotate, we apply established IR techniques of pooling and active learning. Secondly, to improve both consistency and value of annotations, we apply task decomposition [52] and annotator rationale [26] techniques. Using the above techniques, we create and share a new benchmark dataset1 for hate speech detection with broader coverage than prior datasets. We also show a dramatic drop in accuracy of existing detection models when tested on these broader forms of hate. Collected annotator rationales not only provide documented support for labeling decisions but also create exciting future work opportunities for dual-supervision [50] and/or explanation generation in modeling.

1111,Social Media Toxicity Classification Using Deep Learning: Real-World Application UK Brexit,"Social media has become an essential facet of modern society, wherein people share their opinions on a wide variety of topics. Social media is quickly becoming indispensable for a majority of people, and many cases of social media addiction have been documented. Social media platforms such as Twitter have demonstrated over the years the value they provide, such as connecting people from all over the world with different backgrounds. However, they have also shown harmful side effects that can have serious consequences. One such harmful side effect of social media is the immense toxicity that can be found in various discussions. The word toxic has become synonymous with online hate speech, internet trolling, and sometimes outrage culture. In this study, we build an efficient model to detect and classify toxicity in social media from user-generated content using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The BERT pre-trained model and three of its variants has been fine-tuned on a well-known labeled toxic comment dataset, Kaggle public dataset (Toxic Comment Classification Challenge). Moreover, we test the proposed models with two datasets collected from Twitter from two different periods to detect toxicity in user-generated content (tweets) using hashtages belonging to the UK Brexit.

1115,Metaheuristic Ant Lion and Moth Flame Optimization-Based Novel Approach for Automatic Detection of Hate Speech in Online Social Networks,"In the online social networks, blogs, microblogs, social bookmarking services and sharing sites, and various web forum pages; the sharing of knowledge, opinions, ideas, etc. are spreading very quickly. This situation brings very dangerous problems in social networks. One of these problems is hate speech detection (HSD) problem which is covering issues such as insults, swearing, humiliation, discrimination, exclusion, detest, abhor, blast, damn, and intolerance. These can be reactions to a person, a group, an organization, an order, or an event. Although few machine learning methods have been used in the literature to solve this important problem in online social media, the performance of the HSD models in terms of many metrics needs to be increased. In this study, an automatic HSD system based on metaheuristic methodology was proposed for better results in this new and important problem. In the proposed optimization approach, Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm were designed for the HSD problem. This is the first attempt to use optimization algorithms as solution search strategies for automatic HSD. An efficient representation scheme and flexible fitness function were designed for this purpose. Many metrics can easily be embedded into the designed fitness function in order to be simultaneously optimized. Firstly, the basic natural language processing (NLP) steps were carried out. Feature extraction was performed using Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency (TF), and document vector (Word2Vec). Then, the performances of the proposed novel approaches were analyzed in detail on the three different real-world data. The obtained results were also checked against eight popular supervised machine learning algorithms, Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm, and state-of-the-art Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA). Considering the evaluation criteria for three sets of experiments, it was observed that the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and f-score results of the ALO and MFO algorithms were superior to machine learning methods. As a result of the experimental studies, the highest accuracy value was 92.1% for ALO, while this value was 90.7% for MFO. Other numerical values obtained in the study were given in the experiments and results section with tables and graphics in detail. Due to the promising results of the proposed approaches, they are anticipated to be used in the solution of many social media and networking problems.",IEEE Access,2021.0,65,4,0,True,"This is the first attempt to use optimization algorithms as solution search strategies for automatic HSD, and it was observed that the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and f-score results of the ALO and MFO algorithms were superior to machine learning methods.",,,,,1115,41030353,C.

1121,An Evaluation of Multilingual Offensive Language Identification Methods for the Languages of India,"The pervasiveness of offensive content in social media has become an important reason for concern for online platforms. With the aim of improving online safety, a large number of studies applying computational models to identify such content have been published in the last few years, with promising results.

Recent work has addressed offensive language identification from a low-resource perspective, exploring data augmentation strategies and trying to take advantage of existing multilingual pretrained models to cope with data scarcity in low-resource scenarios. In this work, we revisit the problem of low-resource offensive language identification by evaluating the performance of multilingual transformers in offensive language identification for languages spoken in India.

1123,Does BERT Pay Attention to Cyberbullying?,"Social media have brought threats like cyberbullying, which can lead to stress, anxiety, depression, and in some severe cases, suicide attempts. Detecting cyberbullying can help to warn/ block bullies and provide support to victims. However, very few studies have used self-attention-based language models like BERT for cyberbullying detection and they typically only report BERT's performance without examining in depth the reasons for its performance. In this work, we examine the use of BERT for cyberbullying detection on various datasets and attempt to explain its performance by analyzing its attention weights and gradient-based feature importance scores for textual and linguistic features. Our results show that attention weights do not correlate with feature importance scores and thus do not explain the model's performance. Additionally, they suggest that BERT relies on syntactical biases in the datasets to assign feature importance scores to class-related wordsrather than cyberbullying-related linguistic features.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2021.0,73,7,0,True,"Examination of the use of BERT for cyberbullying detection on various datasets shows that attention weights do not correlate with feature importance scores and thus do not explain the model's performance, and it is suggested that BERT relies on syntactical biases in the datasets to assign features importance scores to class-related wordsrather than cyberbullies-related linguistic features.",,,,,1123,117575452,Fatma Elsafoury,2067851,S.

1124,Hater-O-Genius Aggression Classification using Capsule Networks,"Contending hate speech in social media is one of the most challenging social problems of our time. There are various types of anti-social behavior in social media. Foremost of them is aggressive behavior, which is causing many social issues such as affecting the social lives and mental health of social media users. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end ensemble-based architecture to automatically identify and classify aggressive tweets. Tweets are classiﬁed into three categories Covertly Aggressive, Overtly Aggressive, and Non-Aggressive. The proposed architecture is an ensemble of smaller subnetworks that are able to characterize the feature embeddings effectively. We demonstrate qualitatively that each of the smaller subnetworks is able to learn unique features. Our best model is an ensemble of Capsule Networks and results in a 65.2% F1 score on the Facebook test set, which results in a performance gain of 0.95% over the TRAC-2018 winners.

1125,A Study of Multilingual Toxic Text Detection Approaches under Imbalanced Sample Distribution,"Multilingual characteristics, lack of annotated data, and imbalanced sample distribution are the three main challenges for toxic comment analysis in a multilingual setting. This paper proposes a multilingual toxic text classifier which adopts a novel fusion strategy that combines different loss functions and multiple pre-training models. Specifically, the proposed learning pipeline starts with a series of pre-processing steps, including translation, word segmentation, purification, text digitization, and vectorization, to convert word tokens to a vectorized form suitable for the downstream tasks. Two models, multilingual bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (MBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R), are employed for pre-training through Masking Language Modeling (MLM) and Translation Language Modeling (TLM), which incorporate semantic and contextual information into the models. We train six base models and fuse them to obtain three fusion models using the F1 scores as the weights. The models are evaluated on the Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment dataset. Experimental results show that the best fusion model outperforms the two state-of-the-art models, MBERT and XLM-R, in F1 score by 5.05% and 0.76%, respectively, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed fusion strategy.",Inf.,2021.0,57,8,0,True,"A multilingual toxic text classifier which adopts a novel fusion strategy that combines different loss functions and multiple pre-training models is proposed, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed fusion strategy.",,,,,1125,2110103761,Guizhe Song,2610330,Degen Huang,2116551986,Zhifeng Xiao,,,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle
1126,Developing an Explainable Machine Learning-Based Personalised Dementia Risk Prediction Model: A Transfer Learning Approach With Ensemble Learning Algorithms,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has its onset many decades before dementia develops, and work is ongoing to characterise individuals at risk of decline on the basis of early detection through biomarker and cognitive testing as well as the presence/absence of identified risk factors. Risk prediction models for AD based on various computational approaches, including machine learning, are being developed with promising results. However, these approaches have been criticised as they are unable to generalise due to over-reliance on one data source, poor internal and external validations, and lack of understanding of prediction models, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these prediction models. We propose a framework that employs a transfer-learning paradigm with ensemble learning algorithms to develop explainable personalised risk prediction models for dementia. Our prediction models, known as source models, are initially trained and tested using a publicly available dataset (n = 84,856, mean age = 69 years) with 14 years of follow-up samples to predict the individual risk of developing dementia. The decision boundaries of the best source model are further updated by using an alternative dataset from a different and much younger population (n = 473, mean age = 52 years) to obtain an additional prediction model known as the target model. We further apply the SHapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm to visualise the risk factors responsible for the prediction at both population and individual levels. The best source model achieves a geometric accuracy of 87%, specificity of 99%, and sensitivity of 76%. In comparison to a baseline model, our target model achieves better performance across several performance metrics, within an increase in geometric accuracy of 16.9%, specificity of 2.7%, and sensitivity of 19.1%, an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 11% and a transfer learning efficacy rate of 20.6%. The strength of our approach is the large sample size used in training the source model, transferring and applying the “knowledge” to another dataset from a different and undiagnosed population for the early detection and prediction of dementia risk, and the ability to visualise the interaction of the risk factors that drive the prediction. This approach has direct clinical utility.",Frontiers in Big Data,2021.0,54,15,0,True,This work proposes a framework that employs a transfer-learning paradigm with ensemble learning algorithms to develop explainable personalised risk prediction models for dementia and applies the SHapely Additive exPlanation algorithm to visualise the risk factors responsible for the prediction at both population and individual levels.,,,,,1126,1748623,S.

The controversies in these groups, especially, the infamous Gamergate controversy indicates that sexist behaviour is prevalent in this circle. The social dynamics of these communities are closely examined in this research. In particular, posts from Twitter and Reddit are analysed to determine the racism, sexism, and political affiliation persisting in these groups. Twitter and Reddit posts related to 13 popular games which have been discussed below are analysed to find answers to the research question. NLP tools such as Bag of Words, Sentiment Analysis, and Word Embeddings are applied to analyse the posts.

1128,HelaNER: A Novel Approach for Nested Named Entity Boundary Detection,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a prominent task in identifying text spans to specific types. Named entity boundary detection can be mentioned as a rising research area under NER. Although a limited work has been conducted for nested NE boundary detection, flat NE boundary detection can be considered as at a pinnacle stage. Nested NE boundary detection is an important aspect in information extraction, information retrieval, event extraction, sentiment analysis etc. On the other hand, spreading religious unhealthy statements through social media has become a burden for the wellbeing of the society. The prime objective of this research is to implement a novel system for nested NE boundary detection for Sinhala language considering religious unhealthy statements in social media. A constructive literature survey has been conducted for analyzing the already developed NE type and boundary detection approaches and systems. Along with that, identifying the linguistic structures and patterns of Sinhala hate speech detection has been conducted. A corpus of more than 100,000 Sinhala hates speech contents have been extracted, preprocessed, and annotated by an expert panel. Then, a deep neural approach has been applied for capturing the complexity indexes, matrices, and other related elements of the corpus. Next, a novel approach called ""boundary bubbles"" has been conducted for capturing word representation, head word detection, entity mention nuggets identification and region classification for NE boundary detection.

To design and develop detection systems that are capable of achieving satisfactory performance, a thorough understanding of the nature and properties of the targeted type of conflictual language is of great importance. The scientific communities investigating human psychology and social behavior have studied these languages in details, but their insights have only partially reached the computer science community. In this survey, we aim both at systematically characterizing the conceptual properties of online conflictual languages, and at investigating the extent to which they are reflected in state-of-the-art automatic detection systems. Through an analysis of psychology literature, we provide a reconciled taxonomy that denotes the ensemble of conflictual languages typically studied in computer science. We then characterize the conceptual mismatches that can be observed in the main semantic and contextual properties of these languages and their treatment in computer science works; and systematically uncover resulting technical biases in the design of machine learning classification models and the dataset created for their training.

1137,Two Contrasting Data Annotation Paradigms for Subjective NLP Tasks,"Labelled data is the foundation of most natural language processing tasks. However, labelling data is difficult and there often are diverse valid beliefs about what the correct data labels should be. So far, dataset creators have acknowledged annotator subjectivity, but rarely actively managed it in the annotation process. This has led to partly-subjective datasets that fail to serve a clear downstream use. To address this issue, we propose two contrasting paradigms for data annotation. The descriptive paradigm encourages annotator subjectivity, whereas the prescriptive paradigm discourages it. Descriptive annotation allows for the surveying and modelling of different beliefs, whereas prescriptive annotation enables the training of models that consistently apply one belief. We discuss benefits and challenges in implementing both paradigms, and argue that dataset creators should explicitly aim for one or the other to facilitate the intended use of their dataset. Lastly, we conduct an annotation experiment using hate speech data that illustrates the contrast between the two paradigms.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2021.0,67,25,0,True,It is argued that dataset creators should explicitly aim for one or the other of the descriptive or prescriptive paradigms for data annotation to facilitate the intended use of their dataset.,,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07475'}]","P Röttger, B Vidgen, D Hovy… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2021 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'P Röttger', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7rpmd9cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=7rpmd9cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '7rpmd9cAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'B Vidgen', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yRhnVoIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=yRhnVoIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'yRhnVoIAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'D Hovy', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7xluaTAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=7xluaTAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '7xluaTAAAAAJ'}]",1137,2043232919,Paul Röttger,2737827,Bertie Vidgen,2022288,Dirk Hovy,1970864,J.

It is proven that the deep learning-based approaches produce better accuracy for text-based classification than other existing approaches. A novel decentralized deep learning approach called MaLang is developed to detect abusive textual content. MaLang is deployed at two levels in a network: (1) the System Level and (2) the Cloud Level, to tackle the usage of toxic or abusive content on any messaging application within a company’s networks. The system-level module consists of a simple deep learning model called CASE that reads the user’s messaging data and classifies them into abusive and non-abusive categories, without sending any raw or readable data to the cloud. Identified abusive messages are sent to the cloud module with a unique identifier to keep user profiles hidden. The cloud module, called KIPP, utilizes deep learning to determine the probability of a message containing different categories of toxic content, such as: ‘Toxic’, ‘Insult’, ‘Threat’, or ‘Hate Speech’. MaLang achieves a 98.2% classification accuracy that outperforms other current cyberbullying detection systems.",Applied Sciences,2021.0,65,0,0,True,"A novel decentralized deep learning approach called MaLang is developed to detect abusive textual content, which achieves a 98.2% classification accuracy that outperforms other current cyberbullying detection systems.",,"[{'title': 'mdpi.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/18/8701/pdf'}]","P Kompally, SC Sethuraman, S Walczak, S Johnson… - Applied Sciences, 2021 - mdpi.com","[{'name': 'S Walczak', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vKtg3n4AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=vKtg3n4AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'vKtg3n4AAAAJ'}]",1138,1999184867,Pranav Kompally,1379601734,S.

1145,When the Timeline Meets the Pipeline: A Survey on Automated Cyberbullying Detection,"Web 2.0 helped user-generated platforms to spread widely. Unfortunately, it also allowed for cyberbullying to spread. Cyberbullying has negative effects that could lead to cases of depression and low self-esteem. It has become crucial to develop tools for automated cyberbullying detection. The research on developing these tools has been growing over the last decade, especially with the recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing. Given the large body of work on this topic, it is vital to critically review the literature on cyberbullying within the context of these latest advances. In this paper, we survey the automated detection of cyberbullying. Our survey sheds light on some challenges and limitations for the field. The challenges range from defining cyberbullying, data collection, and feature representation to model selection, training, and evaluation. We also provide some suggestions for improving the task of cyberbullying detection. In addition to the survey, we propose to improve the task of cyberbullying detection by addressing some of the raised limitations: 1) Using recent contextual language models like BERT for the detection of cyberbullying; 2) Using slang-based word embeddings to generate better representations of the cyberbullying-related datasets. Our results show that BERT outperforms state-of-the-art cyberbullying detection models and deep learning models.

1147,Modeling Users and Online Communities for Abuse Detection: A Position on Ethics and Explainability,"Abuse on the Internet is an important societal problem of our time. Millions of Internet users face harassment, racism, personal attacks, and other types of abuse across various platforms. The psychological effects of abuse on individuals can be profound and lasting. Consequently, over the past few years, there has been a substantial research effort towards automated abusive language detection in the field of NLP. In this position paper, we discuss the role that modeling of users and online communities plays in abuse detection. Specifically, we review and analyze the state of the art methods that leverage user or community information to enhance the understanding and detection of abusive language. We then explore the ethical challenges of incorporating user and community information, laying out considerations to guide future research. Finally, we address the topic of explainability in abusive language detection, proposing properties that an explainable method should aim to exhibit.

1149,"ExtremeBB: Enabling Large-Scale Research into Extremism, the Manosphere and Their Correlation by Online Forum Data","Online extremism is a growing and pernicious problem, and increas-ingly linked to real-world violence. We introduce a new resource to help research and understand it: ExtremeBB is a structured textual dataset containing nearly 44M posts made by more than 300K registered members on 12 different online extremist forums, enabling both qualitative and quantitative large-scale analyses of historical trends going back two decades. It enables us to trace the evolution of different strands of extremist ideology; to measure levels of toxicity while exploring and developing the tools to do so better; to track the relationships between online subcultures and external political movements such as MAGA (the importance of which was seen in the attack on the US Capitol in January 2021); and to explore links with misogyny and violence, including radicalisation and recruitment. To illustrate a few potential uses, we apply statistical and data-mining techniques to analyse the online extremist landscape in a variety of ways, from posting patterns through topic modelling to toxicity and the membership overlap across different communities. A pic-ture emerges of communities working as support networks, with complex discussions over a wide variety of topics. The discussions of many topics show a level of disagreement which challenges the perception of homogeneity among these groups. These two features of mutual support and a wide range of attitudes lead us to suggest a more nuanced policy approach than simply shutting down these websites. Censorship might remove the support that lonely and troubled individuals are receiving, and fuel paranoid perceptions that the world is against them, though this must be balanced with other benefits of de-platforming. ExtremeBB can help develop a better understanding of these sub-cultures which may lead to more effective interventions; it also opens up the prospect of research to develop better tools to identify hate speech, and to monitor the effectiveness of any interventions that are undertaken.",ArXiv,2021.0,54,6,0,False,"ExtremeBB is a structured textual dataset containing nearly 44M posts made by more than 300K registered members on 12 different online extremist forums, enabling both qualitative and quantitative large-scale analyses of historical trends going back two decades.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04479'}]","AV Vu, L Wilson, YT Chua, I Shumailov… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2021 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'AV Vu', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3VIRXDQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=3VIRXDQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '3VIRXDQAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'YT Chua', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tt6tZ_sAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=tt6tZ_sAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'tt6tZ_sAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'I Shumailov', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e-YbZyEAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=e-YbZyEAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'e-YbZyEAAAAJ'}]",1149,87539217,A.

1150,"Vocal, visible and vulnerable: female politicians at the intersection of Islamophobia, sexism and liberal multiculturalism","ABSTRACT To understand the burdens of “representing diversity” in multicultural democracies, this paper empirically explores Twitter posts about two female Muslim Canadian politicians, Iqra Khalid and Maryam Monsef. Using a mixed method approach, the study reveals that the majority of the most retweeted posts referring to the two members of Parliament were negative in tone. Khalid received more abusive tweets than Monsef, even though she is less prominent, due to the former’s introduction of an anti-Islamophobia bill. When we examined all the tweets using digital methods, however, we found that the tweets are mostly neutral and that only a small fraction counted as abusive language. This analysis thus reveals that toxicity in the online chatter is manifested mainly in the most retweeted posts, main topics, and recurrent hashtags which audiences often engage with, and that the “long tail,” which comprises the majority of tweets, are mainly neutral. This highlights the disproportionate effects of social media amplification of certain attacks and raises questions regarding the status of individual voices. It also supports findings of intersectional discrimination: so-called visible minority women are attacked, regardless of their political prominence, especially if they seek to redress discrimination.",Feminist Media Studies,2021.0,55,3,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'google.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jak1jmrZ9Ov9DruKV-Lud9a_GOaF39S1/view'}]","A Al-Rawi, WHK Chun, S Amer - Feminist Media Studies, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'A Al-Rawi', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xfSNXDEAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=xfSNXDEAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'xfSNXDEAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'WHK Chun', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v_x4nFoAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=v_x4nFoAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'v_x4nFoAAAAJ'}]",1150,2003244,Ahmed Al-Rawi,16155747,Wendy H.

1152,Sentiment Analysis for Fake News Detection,"In recent years, we have witnessed a rise in fake news, i.e., provably false pieces of information created with the intention of deception. The dissemination of this type of news poses a serious threat to cohesion and social well-being, since it fosters political polarization and the distrust of people with respect to their leaders. The huge amount of news that is disseminated through social media makes manual verification unfeasible, which has promoted the design and implementation of automatic systems for fake news detection. The creators of fake news use various stylistic tricks to promote the success of their creations, with one of them being to excite the sentiments of the recipients. This has led to sentiment analysis, the part of text analytics in charge of determining the polarity and strength of sentiments expressed in a text, to be used in fake news detection approaches, either as a basis of the system or as a complementary element. In this article, we study the different uses of sentiment analysis in the detection of fake news, with a discussion of the most relevant elements and shortcomings, and the requirements that should be met in the near future, such as multilingualism, explainability, mitigation of biases, or treatment of multimedia elements.",,2021.0,204,42,3,True,"This article study the different uses of sentiment analysis in the detection of fake news, with a discussion of the most relevant elements and shortcomings, and the requirements that should be met in the near future, such as multilingualism, explainability, mitigation of biases, or treatment of multimedia elements.",,,,,1152,49549996,Miguel A.

We investigate the extent to which pretrained LMs can be prompted to generate toxic language, and the effectiveness of controllable text generation algorithms at preventing such toxic degeneration. We create and release RealToxicityPrompts, a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. Using RealToxicityPrompts, we find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We empirically assess several controllable generation methods, and find that while data- or compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g., banning “bad” words), no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et. al, 2019), and find a significant amount of offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic content. Our work provides a test bed for evaluating toxic generations by LMs and stresses the need for better data selection processes for pretraining.",Findings,2020.0,87,277,68,True,"It is found that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts, and empirically assess several controllable generation methods find that while data- or compute-intensive methods are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions, no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration.",,,,,1154,1962694751,Samuel Gehman,40895369,Suchin Gururangan,2729164,Maarten Sap,1699545,Yejin Choi,144365875,Noah A.

1155,Efficient Detection of Multilingual Hate Speech by Using Interactive Attention Network with Minimal Human Feedback,"Online hate speech on social media has become a critical problem for social network services that has been further fueled by the self-isolation in the COVID-2019 pandemic. Current studies have primarily focused on detecting hate speech in one language due to the complexity of the task; however, hate speech has no boundaries across the languages and geographies in the real world nowadays. This demands further investigation on multilingual hate speech detection methods, with strong requirements for model interpretability to effectively understand the context of the model errors. In this paper, we propose a Multilingual Interactive Attention Network (MLIAN) model for hate speech detection on multilingual social media text corpora, by building upon the attention networks for interpretability and human-in-the-loop paradigm for model adaptability. This model interactively learns to give attention to the relevant contextual words and leverage the labels for the hate target mentions from the simulated human feedback. We evaluated the proposed model on SemEval-2019 Task 5 datasets in English and Spanish. Extensive experimentation of model training in both settings of single and multiple language data demonstrates the superior performance of our model (with AUC more than 84%) compared to the strong baselines. Our results show that human feedback not only improves the model performance but also helps to improve the interpretability of the model by establishing a strong connection between the learned attention weights and semantic frames for the text across languages. Further, an analysis of the amount of human feedback required to achieve reliable and increased model performance shows that less than 4% of training data is sufficient. The application of the MLIAN method can inform future studies on multilingual hate speech.",Web Science Conference,2021.0,53,3,0,False,"A Multilingual Interactive Attention Network (MLIAN) model for hate speech detection on multilingual social media text corpora is proposed, by building upon the attention networks for interpretability and human-in-the-loop paradigm for model adaptability.",,,,,1155,1516914336,Fedor Vitiugin,35502323,Yasas Senarath,1571574252,Hemant Purohit,,,,,,,Computer Science,"JournalArticle, Book"

1157,Automatic Fairness Testing of Neural Classifiers Through Adversarial Sampling,"Although deep learning has demonstrated astonishing performance in many applications, there are still concerns about its dependability. One desirable property of deep learning applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e., non-discrimination). Unfortunately, discrimination might be intrinsically embedded into the models due to the discrimination in the training data. As a countermeasure, fairness testing systemically identifies discriminatory samples, which can be used to retrain the model and improve the model’s fairness. Existing fairness testing approaches however have two major limitations. First, they only work well on traditional machine learning models and have poor performance (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency) on deep learning models. Second, they only work on simple structured (e.g., tabular) data and are not applicable for domains such as text. In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing a scalable and effective approach for systematically searching for discriminatory samples while extending existing fairness testing approaches to address a more challenging domain, i.e., text classification. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which is significantly more scalable and effective. Experimental results show that on average, our approach explores the search space much more effectively (9.62 and 2.38 times more than the state-of-the-art methods respectively on tabular and text datasets) and generates much more discriminatory samples (24.95 and 2.68 times) within a same reasonable time. Moreover, the retrained models reduce discrimination by 57.2 and 60.2 percent respectively on average.",IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2021.0,62,6,2,True,"This work proposes a scalable and effective approach for systematically searching for discriminatory samples while extending existing fairness testing approaches to address a more challenging domain, i.e., text classification, which only employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering.",,,,,1157,2115512751,Peixin Zhang,2115889967,Jingyi Wang,2111628876,Jun Sun,2115554415,Xinyu Wang,2059261893,Guoliang Dong,2144802278,Xingen Wang,Computer Science,JournalArticle
1158,#ContextMatters: Advantages and Limitations of Using Machine Learning to Support Women in Politics,"The United Nations identified gender equality as a Sustainable Development Goal in 2015, recognizing the underrepresentation of women in politics as a specific barrier to achieving gender equality. Political systems around the world experience gender inequality across all levels of elected government as fewer women run for office than men. This is due in part to online abuse, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter, where women seeking or in power tend to be targeted with more toxic maltreatment than their male counterparts. In this paper, we present reflections on ParityBOT—the first natural language processing-based intervention designed to affect online discourse for women in politics for the better, at scale. Deployed across elections in Canada, the United States and New Zealand, ParityBOT was used to analyse and classify more than 12 million tweets directed at women candidates and counter toxic tweets with supportive ones. From these elections we present three case studies highlighting the current limitations of, and future research and application opportunities for, using a natural language processing-based system to detect online toxicity, specifically with regards to contextually important microaggressions. We examine the rate of false negatives, where ParityBOT failed to pick up on insults directed at specific high profile women, which would be obvious to human users. We examine the unaddressed harms of microaggressions and the potential of yet unseen damage they cause for women in these communities, and for progress towards gender equality overall, in light of these technological blindspots.

1160,Annotators with Attitudes: How Annotator Beliefs And Identities Bias Toxic Language Detection,"The perceived toxicity of language can vary based on someone’s identity and beliefs, but this variation is often ignored when collecting toxic language datasets, resulting in dataset and model biases. We seek to understand the *who*, *why*, and *what* behind biases in toxicity annotations. In two online studies with demographically and politically diverse participants, we investigate the effect of annotator identities (*who*) and beliefs (*why*), drawing from social psychology research about hate speech, free speech, racist beliefs, political leaning, and more. We disentangle *what* is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three characteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect, and vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity and beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative annotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were less likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE as toxic. We additionally present a case study illustrating how a popular toxicity detection system’s ratings inherently reflect only specific beliefs and perspectives.

1164,Common sense or censorship: How algorithmic moderators and message type influence perceptions of online content deletion,"Hateful content online is a concern for social media platforms, policymakers, and the public. This has led high-profile content platforms, such as Facebook, to adopt algorithmic content-moderation systems; however, the impact of algorithmic moderation on user perceptions is unclear. We experimentally test the extent to which the type of content being removed (profanity vs hate speech) and the explanation given for its removal (no explanation vs link to community guidelines vs specific explanation) influence user perceptions of human and algorithmic moderators. Our preregistered study encompasses representative samples ( N = 2870) from the United States, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Contrary to expectations, our findings suggest that algorithmic moderation is perceived as more transparent than human, especially when no explanation is given for content removal.

1165,An analysis of unconscious gender bias in academic texts by means of a decision algorithm,"Inclusive language focuses on using the vocabulary to avoid exclusion or discrimination, specially referred to gender. The task of finding gender bias in written documents must be performed manually, and it is a time-consuming process. Consequently, studying the usage of non-inclusive language on a document, and the impact of different document properties (such as author gender, date of presentation, etc.) on how many non-inclusive instances are found, is quite difficult or even impossible for big datasets. This research analyzes the gender bias in academic texts by analyzing a study corpus of more than 12,000 million words obtained from more than one hundred thousand doctoral theses from Spanish universities. For this purpose, an automated algorithm was developed to evaluate the different characteristics of the document and look for interactions between age, year of publication, gender or the field of knowledge in which the doctoral thesis is framed. The algorithm identified information patterns using a CNN (convolutional neural network) by the creation of a vector representation of the sentences. The results showed evidence that there was a greater bias as the age of the authors increased, who were more likely to use non-inclusive terms; it was concluded that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men, and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger. The results showed evidence that the age of the authors increased discrimination, with men being more likely to use non-inclusive terms (up to an index of 23.12), showing that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men in all age ranges (with an average of 14.99), and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger (falling down to 13.07). In terms of field of knowledge, the humanities are the most biased (20.97), discarding the subgroup of Linguistics, which has the least bias at all levels (9.90), and the field of science and engineering, which also have the least influence (13.46). Those results support the assumption that the bias in academic texts (doctoral theses) is due to unconscious issues: otherwise, it would not depend on the field, age, gender, and would occur in any field in the same proportion. The innovation provided by this research lies mainly in the ability to detect, within a textual document in Spanish, whether the use of language can be considered non-inclusive, based on a CNN that has been trained in the context of the doctoral thesis. A significant number of documents have been used, using all accessible doctoral theses from Spanish universities of the last 40 years; this dataset is only manageable by data mining systems, so that the training allows identifying the terms within the context effectively and compiling them in a novel dictionary of non-inclusive terms.",PLoS ONE,2021.0,98,2,0,True,"An automated algorithm was developed to evaluate the different characteristics of the document and look for interactions between age, year of publication, gender or the field of knowledge in which the doctoral thesis is framed, showing evidence that the bias in academic texts (doctoral theses) is due to unconscious issues.",Html,"[{'title': 'plos.org', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257903'}]","P Orgeira-Crespo, C Míguez-Álvarez… - Plos one, 2021 - journals.plos.org","[{'name': 'C Míguez-Álvarez', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uYYanQwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=uYYanQwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'uYYanQwAAAAJ'}]",1165,1995519339,Pedro Orgeira-Crespo,1403905031,C.

1166,Sequence-to-Sequence Lexical Normalization with Multilingual Transformers,"Current benchmark tasks for natural language processing contain text that is qualitatively different from the text used in informal day to day digital communication. This discrepancy has led to severe performance degradation of state-of-the-art NLP models when fine-tuned on real-world data. One way to resolve this issue is through lexical normalization, which is the process of transforming non-standard text, usually from social media, into a more standardized form. In this work, we propose a sentence-level sequence-to-sequence model based on mBART, which frames the problem as a machine translation problem. As the noisy text is a pervasive problem across languages, not just English, we leverage the multi-lingual pre-training of mBART to fine-tune it to our data. While current approaches mainly operate at the word or subword level, we argue that this approach is straightforward from a technical standpoint and builds upon existing pre-trained transformer networks.

Recently, researchers have applied pre-trained visual-linguistic models to perform the multimodal classification task, and some of these solutions have yielded promising results. However, what these visual-linguistic models learn for the hateful meme classification task remains unclear. For instance, it is unclear if these models are able to capture the derogatory or slurs references in multimodality (i.e., image and text) of the hateful memes. To fill this research gap, this paper propose three research questions to improve our understanding of these visual-linguistic models performing the hateful meme classification task. We found that the image modality contributes more to the hateful meme classification task, and the visual-linguistic models are able to perform visual-text slurs grounding to a certain extent.

1168,Delphi: Towards Machine Ethics and Norms,"Failing to account for moral norms could notably hinder AI systems’ ability to interact with people. AI systems empirically require social, cultural, and ethical norms to make moral judgments. However, open-world situations with different groundings may shift moral implications significantly. For example, while “driving my friend to the airport” is “good”, “driving my friend to the airport with a car I stole” is “not okay.” In natural language processing, machine moral reasoning is still in a preliminary stage, illuminating the importance of research on steering machines to making ethical judgments. Inspired by descriptive ethics, a line of research on morality focusing on people’s moral judgments relevant to everyday situations, we conduct the first major attempt to computationally explore the vast space of moral implications in real-world settings. We introduce COMMONSENSE NORM BANK, a semiautomatically constructed dataset from several sources (e.g., SOCIAL CHEMISTRY) with 1.7M instances of descriptive ethics, covering a wide spectrum of everyday situations in contextualized, narrative, and sociallyor demographicallybiased settings. We present Delphi, a unified model of descriptive ethics empowered by diverse data of people’s moral judgment from COMMONSENSE NORM BANK. Delphi is robust to generate categorical and/or open-text moral judgments (e.g., “it’s dangerous”) for complex real-life situations (e.g., “driving my friend to the airport early in the morning when I was drunk last night”). Delphi demonstrates highly promising empirical results, with 92.1% accuracy, which outperforms the out-ofthe-box GPT-3 model with extensive prompting by a significant margin (83.9%) . We also provide careful study of Delphi’s limitations, particularly with respect to undesirable biases against underrepresented population, opening doors to further investigation in future research in computational moral reasoning. Closing the gap between machines and people’s moral reasoning is a prerequisite for trustworthy open-world AI deployments. Moral judgment is never simplistic as there can be clash of different ethical/cultural values at play. Thus, developing high-quality corpus of people’s ethical judgment over diverse scenarios is needed to teach machines to make moral judgment.

1169,"For Honor, for Toxicity","Is it possible to detect toxicity in games just by observing in-game behavior? If so, what are the behavioral factors that will help machine learning to discover the unknown relationship between gameplay and toxic behavior? In this initial study, we examine whether it is possible to predict toxicity in the MOBA gameFor Honor by observing in-game behavior for players that have been labeled as toxic (i.e. players that have been sanctioned by Ubisoft community managers). We test our hypothesis of detecting toxicity through gameplay with a dataset of almost 1,800 sanctioned players, and comparing these sanctioned players with unsanctioned players. Sanctioned players are defined by their toxic action type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage) and degree of severity (warned vs. banned). Our findings, based on supervised learning with random forests, suggest that it is not only possible to behaviorally distinguish sanctioned from unsanctioned players based on selected features of gameplay; it is also possible to predict both the sanction severity (warned vs. banned) and the sanction type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage). In particular, all random forest models predict toxicity, its severity, and type, with an accuracy of at least 82%, on average, on unseen players.

Being partially rooted in CS conferences, ""AI ethics"" (AIE) conferences such as FAccT and AIES have quickly become distinct venues where AI's societal implications are discussed and solutions proposed. However, it is largely unknown if these conferences improve upon the historical representational issues of traditional CS venues. In this work, we explore AIE conferences' evolution and compare them across demographic characteristics, publication content, and citation patterns. We find that AIE conferences have increased their internal topical diversity and impact on other CS conferences. Importantly, AIE conferences are highly differentiable, covering topics not represented in other venues. However, and perhaps contrary to the field's aspirations, white authors are more common while seniority and black researchers are represented similarly to CS venues.

Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.",Proc.

1172,Incorporating the Measurement of Moral Foundations Theory into Analyzing Stances on Controversial Topics,"This paper investigates the correlation between moral foundations and the expression of opinions in the form of stance on different issues of public interest. This work is based on the assumption that the formation of values (personal and societal) and language are interrelated, and that we can observe differences in points of view in user-generated text data. We leverage the Moral Foundations Theory to expand the scope of stance analysis by examining the narratives in favor or against several topics. Applying an expanded version of the Moral Foundations Dictionary to a benchmark dataset for stance analysis, we capture and analyze the relationships between moral values and polarized online discussions. Using this enhanced methodology, we find that each social issue has different ""moral and lexical profiles."" While some social issues project more authority related words (Donald Trump), others consists of words related to care and purity (abortion and feminism). Our correlation analysis of stance and morality revealed notable associations between stances on social issues and various types of morality, such as care, fairness, and loyalty, hence demonstrating that there are certain morality types that are more attributed to stance classification than others. Overall, our analysis highlights the usefulness of considering morality when studying stance. The differences observed in various viewpoints and stances highlights linguistic variation in discourse, which may assist in analyzing cultural values and biases in society.",ACM Conference on Hypertext & Social Media,2021.0,83,6,0,False,"The correlation analysis of stance and morality revealed notable associations between stances on social issues and various types of morality, such as care, fairness, and loyalty, hence demonstrating that there are certain morality types that are more attributed to stance classification than others.",,,,,1172,3342374,R.

1173,Keeping Children Safe Online With Limited Resources: Analyzing What is Seen and Heard,"It is every parent’s wish to protect their children from online pornography, cyber bullying and cyber predators. Several existing approaches analyze a limited amount of information stemming from the interactions of the child with the corresponding online party. Some restrict access to websites based on a blacklist of known forbidden URLs, others attempt to parse and analyze the exchanged multimedia content between the two parties. However, new URLs can be used to circumvent a blacklist, and images, video, and text can individually appear to be safe, but need to be judged jointly. We propose a highly modular framework of analyzing content in its final form at the user interface, or Human Computer Interaction (HCI) layer, as it appears before the child: on the screen and through the speakers. Our approach is to produce Children’s Agents for Secure and Privacy Enhanced Reaction (CASPER), which analyzes screen captures and audio signals in real time in order to make a decision based on all of the information at its disposal, with limited hardware capabilities. We employ a collection of deep learning techniques for image, audio and text processing in order to categorize visual content as pornographic or neutral, and textual content as cyberbullying or neutral. We additionally contribute a custom dataset that offers a wide spectrum of objectionable content for evaluation and training purposes.

1175,Politics and Politeness: Analysis of Incivility on Twitter During the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary,"In the past decade, social networking sites have become central forums for public discourse and political engagement. Of particular interest is the role that Twitter plays in the facilitation of political discourse. To this end, the existing literature argues that a healthy political discussion space is key to maintaining a trusting and robust democratic society. Using Suler’s online disinhibition effect as a theoretical orientation, this study seeks to address the extent of incivility on Twitter in discourse regarding the top three 2020 Democratic primary candidates. A total corpus of 18,237,296 tweets was analyzed in an effort to assess the extent to which incivility dominated Twitter discourse surrounding these candidates. Our results reveal that tweets that mention Senator Elizabeth Warren were associated with higher levels of uncivil discourse than tweets that mentioned Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. Interestingly, there does not appear to be a relationship with anonymity and incivility, as uncivil tweets were just as likely to originate from tweets that identified users’ names as they were to originate from anonymous or pseudonymous accounts. Finally, our findings provide evidence that certain policy issues are more closely related to uncivil discourse than others. Through the use of k-means clustering, our findings illustrate that the issue of gun control and immigration is closely related with mentions of Warren and fiscal policy with Sanders; however, we did not find any policy keywords linked to Biden.",Social Media + Society,2021.0,81,3,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'sagepub.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051211036939'}]","BM Trifiro, S Paik, Z Fang, L Zhang - Social Media+ Society, 2021 - journals.sagepub.com","[{'name': 'BM Trifiro', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UuhtJo0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=UuhtJo0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'UuhtJo0AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Paik', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORLrJHoAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=ORLrJHoAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'ORLrJHoAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'L Zhang', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PEzKtMQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=PEzKtMQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'PEzKtMQAAAAJ'}]",1175,116344697,B.

As such, it is often only possible to gather a small amount of high-quality labels.

1178,"Digital failure: Unbecoming the “good” data subject through entropic, fugitive, and queer data","This paper explores the political potential of digital failure as a refusal to work in service of today’s dataveillance society. Moving beyond criticisms of flawed digital systems, this paper traces the moments of digital failure that seek to break, rather than fix, existing systems. Instead, digital failure is characterized by pesky data that sneaks through the cracks of digital capitalism and dissipates into the unproductive; it supports run-away data prone to misidentifications by digital marketers, coders, and content moderators; and it celebrates data predisposed to “back-talk” with playful irreverence toward those that seek to bring order through normative categorization and moderation. I call these data entropic, fugitive, and queer and explore their mischievous practices through three case studies: the unaccountable data in identity resolution, public shaming of the ImageNet training data, and reading practices of sex worker and influencer, @Charlieshe. Together these case studies articulate the political potential of digital failure as a process of unbecoming the good data subject by pushing past the margins of legibility, knowability, and thinkability, to reveal what is made illegible, unknowable, and unthinkable to data’s seeing eye. As predictive analytics, automated decision-systems, and artificial intelligence take on increasingly central roles in public governance, digital failure reveals how data itself is a flawed concept prone to political abuse and social engineering to protect the interests of the powerful, while keeping those marginalized over-surveilled and underrepresented.",,2021.0,114,2,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'sagepub.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951720977882'}]","LE Bridges - Big Data & Society, 2021 - journals.sagepub.com","[{'name': 'LE Bridges', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C9wWBpsAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=C9wWBpsAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'C9wWBpsAAAAJ'}]",1178,46764881,Lauren E.

1179,Sentiment Intensity Prediction using Neural Word Embeddings,"Sentiment analysis is central to the process of mining opinions and attitudes from online texts. While much attention has been paid to the sentiment classification problem, much less work has tried to tackle the problem of predicting the intensity of the sentiment. The go to method is VADER --- an unsupervised lexicon based approach to scoring sentiment. However, such approaches are limited because of the vocabulary mismatch problem. In this paper, we present in detail and evaluate our AWESSOME framework (A Word Embedding Sentiment Scorer Of Many Emotions) for sentiment intensity scoring, that capitalizes on pre-existing lexicons, does not require training and provides fine grained and accurate sentiment intensity scores of words, phrases and text. In our experiments, we used seven Sentiment Collections to evaluate the proposed approach, against lexicon based approaches (e.g., VADER), and supervised methods such as deep learning based approaches (e.g., SentiBERT). The results show that despite not surpassing supervised approaches, the AWESSOME unsupervised approach significantly outperforms existing lexicon approaches and therefore provides a simple and effective approach for sentiment analysis. The AWESSOME framework can be flexibly adapted to cater for different seed lexicons and different neural word embeddings models in order to produce corpus specific lexicons -- without the need for extensive supervised learning or retraining.",International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval,2021.0,41,0,0,True,"This paper presents in detail and evaluates the AWESSOME framework (A Word Embedding Sentiment Scorer Of Many Emotions) for sentiment intensity scoring, that capitalizes on pre-existing lexicons, does not require training and provides fine grained and accurate sentiment intensity scores.",,,,,1179,3442310,Amal Htait,1716332,L.

Esto supone la democratizacion de la informacion que ha hecho posible que los movimientos sociales hayan podido colocar temas en la agenda politica. Por otro lado, el uso de Internet en Espana y la presencia en las redes sociales es similar en varones y mujeres, y en politica, tras las elecciones generales del 28A de 2019, Espana se situa entre los primeros paises europeos en cuanto al numero de mujeres en el Congreso. Pero segun la ONU solo el 6,6% de las mujeres desempenan liderazgos como primeras ministras o presidentas de Gobierno a nivel mundial. Tampoco estan entre las personas que se dedican a la politica con mas seguidores en Twitter y Facebook. Si la presencia de mujeres y varones es similar en cuanto al uso de Internet y las nuevas herramientas digitales o las RRSS y en la politica, nos preguntamos si su participacion es de calidad porque no estan en los espacios de liderazgo y de toma de decisiones en ninguno de estos espacios politicos y digitales.

1182,School Interventions for Bullying–Cyberbullying Prevention in Adolescents: Insights from the UPRIGHT and CREEP Projects,"Background: Several challenges and emotional demands characterize adolescence, affecting the mental well-being of youths. Among these, bullying and cyberbullying are recognized nowadays as a major social problem, affecting more than one-third of adolescents, with extensive negative consequences for the victims involved, such as lower self-esteem, increased loneliness, depression, and anxiety. School programs and interventions that foster resilience, coping, and well-being are particularly important during adolescence as protective and preventive factors against the consequences of (cyber)bullying.

1183,Let’s (re)tweet about racism and sexism: responses to cyber aggression toward Black and Asian women,"ABSTRACT Online, anyone’s words can easily be amplified – and on Twitter, the platform’s algorithm highlights tweets that gain attention from other users, which can exponentially reinforce a tweet’s popularity. Moreover, retweets can help spread a message well beyond the reach of its original poster. Thus, users’ interactions with posts containing or making reference to racism or sexism both illuminate the ways individuals accept, challenge, or engage with racism and sexism online, and shape how those messages spread. Using an original dataset of 59.5 million tweets, I test how particular features of messages referencing Black and Asian women predict user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies). This analysis further focuses on messages including terms that express racist or sexist content. Generally, messages including covert racist or sexist insults have a modest positive effect on all measures of user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies), which may suggest that social media environments allow individuals the time and opportunity to contend with topics that can be more difficult in-person. Additionally, variations in engagement with tweets that include references to women, Black or Asian individuals implies that users respond differently to messages involving references to and normative images of different racial, ethnic, and gendered identities. This research illuminates how specific manifestations of racialized and gendered language referencing women, Black and Asian people can not only encourage more engagement, but also share, accept, or challenge messages about marginalized identities.","Information, Communication & Society",2021.0,46,3,0,False,"This research illuminates how specific manifestations of racialized and gendered language referencing women, Black and Asian people can not only encourage more engagement, but also share, accept, or challenge messages about marginalized identities.",,,,,1183,1768396960,Paulina d.

1185,"Artificial intelligence, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law: a primer","In September 2019, the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers adopted the terms of reference for the Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI). The CAHAI is charged with examining the feasibility and potential elements of a legal framework for the design, development, and deployment of AI systems that accord with Council of Europe standards across the interrelated areas of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. As a first and necessary step in carrying out this responsibility, the CAHAI's Feasibility Study, adopted by its plenary in December 2020, has explored options for an international legal response that fills existing gaps in legislation and tailors the use of binding and non-binding legal instruments to the specific risks and opportunities presented by AI systems. The Study examines how the fundamental rights and freedoms that are already codified in international human rights law can be used as the basis for such a legal framework. It proposes nine principles and priorities that are fitted to the novel challenges posed by the design, development, and deployment of AI systems. When codified into law, these principles and priorities create a set of interlocking rights and obligations that will work towards ensuring that the design and use of AI technologies conform to the values of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.

Situated in the global outbreak of COVID-19, our research aims at detecting semantic shifts in social media language triggered by the health crisis. With COVID-19 related big data extracted from Twitter, we train separate word embedding models for different time periods after the outbreak. We employ an alignment-based approach to compare these embeddings with a general-purpose Twitter embedding unrelated to COVID-19. We also compare our trained embeddings among them to observe diachronic evolution. Carrying out case studies on a set of words chosen by topic detection, we verify that our alignment approach is valid. Finally, we quantify the size of global semantic shift by a stability measure based on back-and-forth rotational alignment.",ArXiv,2021.0,15,5,0,False,This research aims at detecting semantic shifts in social media language triggered by the health crisis by employing an alignment-based approach to compare word embedding models for different time periods after the outbreak and quantifying the size of global semantic shift by a stability measure based on back-and-forth rotational alignment.,,,,,1187,2155600393,Yanzhu Guo,40704095,C.

1191,Challenging social media threats using collective well-being-aware recommendation algorithms and an educational virtual companion,"Social media have become an integral part of our lives, expanding our interlinking capabilities to new levels. There is plenty to be said about their positive effects. On the other hand, however, some serious negative implications of social media have been repeatedly highlighted in recent years, pointing at various threats to society and its more vulnerable members, such as teenagers, in particular, ranging from much-discussed problems such as digital addiction and polarization to manipulative influences of algorithms and further to more teenager-specific issues (e.g., body stereotyping). The impact of social media—both at an individual and societal level—is characterized by the complex interplay between the users' interactions and the intelligent components of the platform. Thus, users' understanding of social media mechanisms plays a determinant role. We thus propose a theoretical framework based on an adaptive “Social Media Virtual Companion” for educating and supporting an entire community, teenage students, to interact in social media environments in order to achieve desirable conditions, defined in terms of a community-specific and participatory designed measure of Collective Well-Being (CWB). This Companion combines automatic processing with expert intervention and guidance. The virtual Companion will be powered by a Recommender System (CWB-RS) that will optimize a CWB metric instead of engagement or platform profit, which currently largely drives recommender systems thereby disregarding any societal collateral effect. CWB-RS will optimize CWB both in the short term by balancing the level of social media threats the users are exposed to, and in the long term by adopting an Intelligent Tutor System role and enabling adaptive and personalized sequencing of playful learning activities. We put an emphasis on experts and educators in the educationally managed social media community of the Companion. They play five key roles: (a) use the Companion in classroom-based educational activities; (b) guide the definition of the CWB; (c) provide a hierarchical structure of learning strategies, objectives and activities that will support and contain the adaptive sequencing algorithms of the CWB-RS based on hierarchical reinforcement learning; (d) act as moderators of direct conflicts between the members of the community; and, finally, (e) monitor and address ethical and educational issues that are beyond the intelligent agent's competence and control. This framework offers a possible approach to understanding how to design social media systems and embedded educational interventions that favor a more healthy and positive society. Preliminary results on the performance of the Companion's components and studies of the educational and psychological underlying principles are presented.",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,2021.0,337,5,0,True,"A theoretical framework based on an adaptive “Social Media Virtual Companion” for educating and supporting an entire community, teenage students, to interact in social media environments in order to achieve desirable conditions, defined in terms of a community-specific and participatory designed measure of Collective Well-Being (CWB).",,,,,1191,1685305,D.

1192,THE CHALLENGES OF REGULATING HATE SPEECH ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN LIGHT OF THE THEORY OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION,"Despite the fact that international human rights documents stipulate that everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression, many nations nowadays have laws that restrict or ban some forms of social media expression, such as speech that provokes hatred and violence. Some free speech advocates prefer an open market of ideas where no expression is restricted thinking that the best answer to harmful speech is discussions that allow different ideas to challenge any speech freely. Other scholars, on the other hand, contend that regulating hate speech on social media is crucial for protecting minority populations from the damages that such speech can inflict. Hate speech poses a difficult question that blurs the lines of free expression. Thus, based on the theories that underpin freedom of expression, this piece of work strives to analyze the regulatory dilemma on hate speech on social media by exploring the arguments and challenges that frame the regulatory process.",,2021.0,140,0,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'dergipark.org.tr', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1719724'}]","B PAULOS, S ÇELİK - Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi Hukuk …, 2021 - dergipark.org.tr","[{'name': 'S ÇELİK', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7_ckP3MAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=7_ckP3MAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '7_ckP3MAAAAJ'}]",1192,120778925,Seydi Çelik,2121642921,Biruk Paulos,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
1193,"Developing Future Human-Centered Smart Cities: Critical Analysis of Smart City Security, Interpretability, and Ethical Challenges","As we make tremendous advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence technosciences, there is a renewed understanding in the AI community that we must ensure that humans being are at the center of our deliberations so that we don't end in technology-induced dystopias. As strongly argued by Green in his book Smart Enough City, the incorporation of technology in city environs does not automatically translate into prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice. There is a great need to deliberate on the future of the cities worth living and designing. There are philosophical and ethical questions involved along with various challenges that relate to the security, safety, and interpretability of AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities. Several research institutes on human centered AI have been established at top international universities. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-compatible. For example, Stuart Russell has a book called Human Compatible AI. The Center for Humane Technology advocates for regulators and technology companies to avoid business models and product features that contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical challenges to a successful deployment of AI or ML in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions.",ArXiv,2020.0,387,8,1,False,"This paper analyzes and explores key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical challenges to a successful deployment of AI or ML in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these challenges.",Pdf,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/77234680/2012.09110v2.pdf'}]","K Ahmada, M Maabrehb, M Ghalyc, K Khand, J Qadire… - academia.edu",,1193,143623051,Kashif Ahmad,3458683,Majdi Maabreh,1658923967,M.

1194,Hate Speech on Social Media: Towards a Context-Specific Content Moderation Policy,"For all practical purposes, the decision of social media companies to prohibit hate speech on their platforms means that the longstanding debate in the United States about whether to limit hate speech in the public square has been resolved in favor of greater regulation. Nonetheless, revisiting these debates provides several insights essential for developing more empirically-based and narrowly tailored policies regarding online hate. 
 
First, a central issue in the hate speech debate is the extent to which hate speech contributes to violence. Those in favor of more robust regulation claim a connection to violence, while others dismiss these arguments as too tenuous to support regulation. The data generated by social media, however, now allow researchers to begin to empirically test whether there are visible, measurable harms resulting from hate speech. These data can assist in developing evidence-based policies to address the most significant harms of hate speech, while avoiding overbroad regulation that is inconsistent with international standards. 
 
Second, reexamining the U.S. debate about hate speech also reveals the serious missteps of social media policies that prohibit hate speech without regard to context. The policies that social media companies have developed attempt to define hate speech solely with respect to the content of the message. As the early advocates of limits on hate speech made clear, the meaning, force, and consequences of speech acts are deeply contextual, and it is impossible to understand the harms of hate speech without reference to local political realities and the power asymmetries between social groups. Regulation that is abstracted from this context will inevitably be overbroad. 
 
This Article revisits these hate speech debates and considers how they map onto the platform law of content moderation, where emerging evidence indicates a correlation between hate speech online, virulent nationalism, and violence against minorities and activists. It then concludes by developing specific recommendations to bring greater consideration of context into the policies and procedures of social media content moderation.",,2020.0,0,3,1,False,,,,,,1194,2111010094,Richard Wilson,118734022,Molly K.

1195,Defending the state from digital Deceit: the reflexive securitization of deepfake,"ABSTRACT Recent revelation of disinformation campaigns conducted by external adversaries on social media platforms has triggered anxiety among western liberal democracies. One focus of this anxiety has been the emerging technology known as deepfake. In examining related controversy, I use the theoretical lens of securitization to establish how communicative reflexivity shapes the attribution of threat to digital media. Next, focusing on the case of the U.S. government, I critique deepfake’s securitization by applying two theories of media and state (in-) security. I argue that deepfake sustains the liberal state’s conventional dread of mimetic threats posed to its ontological security. I then challenge this narrative by exploring satire as an alternate configuration of deepfake’s capabilities. I conclude by summarizing the implications of this case for ongoing study of digital media, conflict, and politics.",,2020.0,132,10,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'researchgate.net', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bryan-Taylor-5/publication/344825967_Defending_the_State_from_Digital_Deceit_The_Reflexive_Securitization_of_Deepfake/links/5f9201e792851c14bcdecca3/Defending-the-State-from-Digital-Deceit-The-Reflexive-Securitization-of-Deepfake.pdf'}]","BC Taylor - Critical Studies in Media Communication, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'BC Taylor', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jtl2s94AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=jtl2s94AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'jtl2s94AAAAJ'}]",1195,48486744,Bryan C.

However, language models capture and proliferate hurtful stereotypes, especially in text generation. Our results show that 4.3% of the time, language models complete a sentence with a hurtful word. These cases are not random, but follow language and gender-specific patterns. We propose a score to measure hurtful sentence completions in language models (HONEST). It uses a systematic template- and lexicon-based bias evaluation methodology for six languages. Our findings suggest that these models replicate and amplify deep-seated societal stereotypes about gender roles. Sentence completions refer to sexual promiscuity when the target is female in 9% of the time, and in 4% to homosexuality when the target is male.

This systematic literature review aims to do just that, following PRISMAguidelines in a review of over 500 English articles that yielded 62 algorithm audit studies. The studies are synthesized and organized primarily by behavior (discrimination, distortion, exploitation, and misjudgement), with codes also provided for domain (e.g. search, vision, advertising, etc.), organization (e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), and audit method (e.g. sock puppet, direct scrape, crowdsourcing, etc.). The review shows how previous audit studies have exposed public-facing algorithms exhibiting problematic behavior, such as search algorithms culpable of distortion and advertising algorithms culpable of discrimination. Based on the studies reviewed, it also suggests some behaviors (e.g. discrimination on the basis of intersectional identities), domains (e.g. advertising algorithms), methods (e.g. code auditing), and organizations (e.g. Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn) that call for future audit attention.

We conduct an experiment combining up to three social categories – gender, religion and disability – into unconditional or zero-shot prompts used to generate sentences that are then analysed for sentiment. Our results confirm earlier tests conducted with auto-regressive causal models, including the GPT family of models. We also illustrate why bias may be resistant to techniques that target single categories (e.g. gender, religion and race), as it can also manifest, in often subtle ways, in texts prompted by concatenated social categories.

1206,Online interventions for reducing hate speech and cyberhate: A systematic review,"Abstract Background The unique feature of the Internet is that individual negative attitudes toward minoritized and racialized groups and more extreme, hateful ideologies can find their way onto specific platforms and instantly connect people sharing similar prejudices. The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television, radio, youth conferences, and text messaging campaigns, interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged. Objectives This review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate. Search Methods We systematically searched 2 database aggregators, 36 individual databases, 6 individual journals, and 34 websites, as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature, and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature. Inclusion Criteria We included randomized and rigorous quasi‐experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10–17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background, religious affiliation, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, or citizenship status. Data Collection and Analysis The systematic search covered January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2020, with searches conducted between August 19, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24, 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention, sample, outcomes, and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta‐analysis on two independent effect sizes. Main Results Two studies were included in the meta‐analysis, one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta‐analysis we chose the treatment arm from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study. However, we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects, while the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = −0.134, 95% confidence interval [−0.321, −0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as “low risk” on the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study as “some” risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and “high risk” for selective outcome reporting bias. The Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as “some concern” for the selective outcome reporting bias domain. Authors' Conclusions The evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi‐experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions, addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software, and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including both extremist and non‐extremist individuals in future intervention studies. We provide suggestions for how future research on online hate speech/cyberhate interventions can fill these gaps moving forward.",Campbell Systematic Reviews,2021.0,114,4,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'wiley.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cl2.1243'}, {'title': 'Full View', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:3gTISGb-OzEJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&num=20&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=2022&as_yhi=2022&scillfp=3521846364861531886&oi=lle'}]","S Windisch, S Wiedlitzka, A Olaghere… - Campbell Systematic …, 2022 - Wiley Online Library","[{'name': 'S Windisch', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AsXiXs0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=AsXiXs0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'AsXiXs0AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'A Olaghere', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mj404oQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Mj404oQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Mj404oQAAAAJ'}]",1206,101702350,Steven Windisch,118532648,Susann Wiedlitzka,81071203,Ajima Olaghere,2088997129,Elizabeth M.

At the Workshop, we revisited the origins of Web Science, explored the challenges and opportunities of the Web, and looked ahead to potential futures for both the Web and Web Science. We explain issues that society faces in the Web by the ambivalences that are inherent in the Web. All the enormous benefits that the Web offers – for information sharing, collective organization and distributed activity, social inclusion and economic growth – will always carry along negative consequences, too, and 30 years after its creation negative consequences of the Web are only too apparent. The Web continues to evolve and its next major step will involve Artificial Intelligence (AI) at large. AI has the potential to amplify positive and negative outcomes, and we explore these possibilities, situating them within the wider debate about the future of regulation and governance for the Web. Finally, we outline the need to extend Web Science as the science that is devoted to the analysis and engineering of the Web, to strengthen our role in shaping the future of the Web and present five key directions for capacity building that are necessary to achieve this: (i), supporting interdisciplinarity, (ii), supporting collaboration, (iii), supporting the sustainable Web, (iv), supporting the Intelligent Web, and (v), supporting the Inclusive Web. Our writing reflects our background in several disciplines of the social and technical sciences and that these disciplines emphasize topics to various extents. We are acutely aware that our observations occupy a particular point in time and are skewed towards our experience as Western scholars – a limitation that Web Science will need to overcome.

1209,Respond and Resolve: A Critical Feminist Inquiry for Technologies of Sexual Governance,"From higher education to workplaces, institutions are increasingly adopting data-driven and semiautomated technologies to facilitate, manage, and arbitrate sexual affairs. These largely US-based systems, which I term “technologies of sexual governance,” are encoded with and reify particular ideologies about sexual (mis)conduct, and thus call for a critical feminist inquiry about their cultural, political, and moral implications for advancing a feminist sexual politics. Drawing from Halley et al.’s “governance feminism” framework, this article makes the case that a critical feminist inquiry into technologies of sexual governance must take into account the co-constitutive nature of feminist sexual politics and technology. Specifically, I argue that critical inquiries must begin by interrogating which feminist ideologies about sex and power gain purchase with and through particular computational logics and form. To demonstrate this approach, I offer two ways of reading feminist scholarly and popular responses to “antirape technologies” that capture both readings’ shortcomings, and I propose a third approach that captures the cultural work that particular feminist ideologies and technologies mutually perform. This article concludes by demonstrating how the third approach can advance a feminist analysis of workplace misconduct management softwares.",Global Perspectives,2021.0,0,2,0,False,,,,,,1209,2077592423,Kate Sim,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

1211,Regulating Personal Cameras for Disabled People and People with Deafblindness: Implications for HCI and Accessible Computing,"In this experience paper we consider the relevance of social policy to the design of personal cameras for accessibility. As researchers with different backgrounds, in disability studies, accessible computing, AI-based systems, HCI and disability policy, we reflect broadly on our experiences of developing assistive technology for and with people with deafblindness. For designers of assistive technology there are usually few restrictions placed on what may be investigated, provided certain ethical and legal standards are met. However, deafblind and disabled people experience many more barriers in how the products of design may be accessed and how they may be used. Social policy is one of the mediators that governs the allocation of resources and benefits, especially for disabled people. We discuss these issues for researchers in the field, using the example of personal cameras: an area of high policy intervention. Awareness of policy is limited in HCI research, and we argue that it has the potential to add focus to work on design and assistive devices for disabled people.

 Grounded in social representation theory and its empirical investigation into the ‘social arena’, inspired by the ‘modelling paradigmatic approach’, the research presented in this article is part of a larger project aimed at reconstructing the ‘multi-voice’, and ‘multi-agent’ discourse about (im)migration. Specifically, this contribution’s focus is on the exploration of shaping and sharing social representations about (im)migrants through communication via the social medium ‘Twitter’. A total of 1,958 tweets (967 Italian and 991 English tweets) were analysed through Systeme Portable Pour L’Analyse Des Donnees Textuelles [Portable System for Textual Data Analysis]SPAD in two lexical correspondence analyses. The results show a dichotomous discourse organising a semantic space structured around five different factors for the two distinct Twitter corpora: both clearly show polarised social representations of ‘immigrants–migrants’, leading to exclusion–inclusion policies depending on the discursive agent’s ideological affiliation in the Italian and the international political frame. Used as a propaganda tool, Twitter echoes the related pro- and anti-immigration polemical representations of opposite political leaders in posts that are positioned differently in relation to the progressive/conservative ideology.",,2021.0,70,10,0,False,,,,,,1212,1844343373,A.

Three studies converged to support our proposition. Specifically, Studies 1 and 2 (n = 387) showed that benevolent sexism was positively associated with women’s financial risk-taking; such that the more benevolent sexism women endorsed, the more financial risks they tended to take. Using an experimental design, Study 3 (n = 126) established the causal link between benevolent sexism and financial risk-taking for women, and also demonstrated the mediating effect of economic dependency. These findings highlight the role of social ideology in influencing women’s financial risk-taking.

1215,Towards Refusing as a Critical Technical Practice: Struggling With Hegemonic Computer Vision,"Computer Vision (CV) algorithms are overwhelmingly presented as efficient, impartial, and desirable further developments of datafication and automation. In reality, hegemonic CV is a particular way of seeing that operates under the goal of identifying and naming, classifying and quantifying, and generally organizing the visual world to support surveillance, be it military or commercial. This paradigm of Computer Vision forms a ‘common sense’ that is difficult to break from, and thus requires radical forms of antagonism. The goal of this article is to sketch how refusing CV can be part of a counter-hegemonic practice – be it the refusal to work or other, more creative, responses. The article begins by defining hegemonic CV, the ‘common sense’ that frames machine seeing as neutral and impartial, while ignoring its wide application for surveillance. Then, it discusses the emergent notion of refusal, and why critical technical practice can be a useful framework for questioning hegemonic sociotechnical systems. Finally, several potential paths for refusing hegemonic CV are outlined by engaging with different layers of the systems’ 'stack.'",A Peer-Reviewed Journal About,2021.0,46,4,1,True,"The goal of this article is to sketch how refusing CV can be part of a counter-hegemonic practice – be it the refusal to work or other, more creative, responses.",,,,,1215,1661008348,Gabriel Pereira,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,

However, current discussions primarily treat gender as binary, which can perpetuate harms such as the cyclical erasure of non-binary gender identities. These harms are driven by model and dataset biases, which are consequences of the non-recognition and lack of understanding of non-binary genders in society. In this paper, we explain the complexity of gender and language around it, and survey non-binary persons to understand harms associated with the treatment of gender as binary in English language technologies. We also detail how current language representations (e.g., GloVe, BERT) capture and perpetuate these harms and related challenges that need to be acknowledged and addressed for representations to equitably encode gender information.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2021.0,45,50,6,True,"The complexity of gender and language around it is explained, how current language representations capture and perpetuate harms and related challenges that need to be acknowledged and addressed for representations to equitably encode gender information are addressed.",,,,,1217,50991767,Sunipa Dev,2051713098,Masoud Monajatipoor,51494507,Anaelia Ovalle,1677386832,Arjun Subramonian,1795436,J.

1218,"Staur, C. (2013). Shared Responsibility: The United Nations in the Age of Globalization","This work is clearly written from the standpoint of a UN insider. Carsten Staur was Denmark’s Ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 2007 to 2013 and later to its Geneva headquarters, and here he aims to show, as the title indicates, that in an age of globalization, the UN still has a key role to play in the international community. However, in doing so, it will have to share its responsibilities over the next ten to fifteen years with, amongst others, some emerging global powers, non-state actors with extensive reach such as multi-national corporations, international media groups, and a range of NGOs, aid and human rights organizations. In this position of shared responsibility, Staur sees the significance of the UN retained in two ways: in setting standards and defining objectives of behaviour within the international community as well as being a source of practical help for those more vulnerable states, especially those seeking to avoid conflict or recovering from its effects. In coming to this conclusion, Staur sets the recent record of the UN as a base from which to argue a future agenda for the organization. The book is divided into five parts, the first two of which cover the structure of the UN, with the focus on the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Secretariat and the peace and security role—much of which would have found a place in any text written during the Cold War. It is the other three parts on Freedom, Development, and Perspectives that reflect what the author sees as greater challenges for the UN and by extension greater opportunities which have arisen since 1989. This structure is set against four “global mega-trends toward 2025” which the author covers in the Introduction and which provide the backdrop for the UN over the next generation. While basing analysis on “trends” is always a perilous path, even the most hardened sceptic of future thinking would find it difficult to argue with Staur’s categories, given that at least four are already plainly visible in the international community. These he sees as: a changing global power structure to include states of rising political significance such as China, Brazil and India; a global struggle over different value systems; the further rise of non-state actors seeking a role in the international community; and finally",,2014.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,1218,2148762495,E.

1219,MultiBench: Multiscale Benchmarks for Multimodal Representation Learning,"Learning multimodal representations involves integrating information from multiple heterogeneous sources of data. It is a challenging yet crucial area with numerous real-world applications in multimedia, affective computing, robotics, finance, human-computer interaction, and healthcare. Unfortunately, multimodal research has seen limited resources to study (1) generalization across domains and modalities, (2) complexity during training and inference, and (3) robustness to noisy and missing modalities. In order to accelerate progress towards understudied modalities and tasks while ensuring real-world robustness, we release MULTIBENCH, a systematic and unified large-scale benchmark for multimodal learning spanning 15 datasets, 10 modalities, 20 prediction tasks, and 6 research areas. MULTIBENCH provides an automated end-to-end machine learning pipeline that simplifies and standardizes data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation. To enable holistic evaluation, MULTIBENCH offers a comprehensive methodology to assess (1) generalization, (2) time and space complexity, and (3) modality robustness. MULTIBENCH introduces impactful challenges for future research, including scalability to large-scale multimodal datasets and robustness to realistic imperfections. To accompany this benchmark, we also provide a standardized implementation of 20 core approaches in multimodal learning spanning innovations in fusion paradigms, optimization objectives, and training approaches. Simply applying methods proposed in different research areas can improve the state-of-the-art performance on 9/15 datasets. Therefore, MULTIBENCH presents a milestone in unifying disjoint efforts in multimodal machine learning research and paves the way towards a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of multimodal models, all the while ensuring ease of use, accessibility, and reproducibility.

Recent research has examined how digital technologies may multiply the involvement of remote, non-present and unanticipated actors in the witnessing of events. This paper examines what digital data practices at Amnesty International’s Decoders initiative can add to the understanding of witnessing. It introduces the notion of ‘data witnessing’ with reference to four projects on (i) witnessing historical abuses with structured data from digitised documents; (ii) witnessing the destruction of villages with satellite imagery and machine learning; (iii) witnessing environmental injustice with company reports and photographs; and (iv) witnessing online abuse through the classification of Twitter data. These projects illustrate the configuration of experimental apparatuses for witnessing injustices with data. In contrast to accounts which emphasise the presence of an individual human witness at the scene, Amnesty’s data practices are conspicuously collective and distributed, rendering the systemic scale of injustices at a distance, across space and time. Such practices may contribute to research on both (new) media witnessing and data politics, suggesting ways in which care, concern and solidarity may be constructed, structured, extended and delimited by means of digital data.","Information, Communication & Society",2019.0,103,12,0,True,,,,,,1222,48417693,J.

Recent work has predominantly focused on measuring and mitigating bias in pretrained language models. Surprisingly, the landscape of bias measurements and mitigation resources and methods for conversational language models is still very scarce: it is limited to only a few types of bias, artificially constructed resources, and completely ignores the impact that debiasing methods may have on the final perfor mance in dialog tasks, e.g., conversational response generation. In this work, we present REDDITBIAS, the first conversational data set grounded in the actual human conversations from Reddit, allowing for bias measurement and mitigation across four important bias dimensions: gender,race,religion, and queerness. Further, we develop an evaluation framework which simultaneously 1)measures bias on the developed REDDITBIAS resource, and 2)evaluates model capability in dialog tasks after model debiasing. We use the evaluation framework to benchmark the widely used conversational DialoGPT model along with the adaptations of four debiasing methods.

Nevertheless, such evidence is often challenged for their authenticity. Our survey (n=91) and interview (n=43) with Bangladeshi online gender harassment victims revealed the depth of the problem, and we set design goals to collect evidence from Facebook Messenger with ensured authenticity. Building on the ‘shame-based model’ of gender justice [12], we designed ‘Unmochon’, a tool that captures authentic evidence and shares with victims’ intended group. Our user-study (n=48) revealed that diminishing authenticity problem may still leave the victim and online gender justice entangled with mob-sentiment, hegemonic legal consciousness, and several privacy aspects. Our findings open up a new discussion on how HCI-design should address online gender justice in such a complex social setting.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2021.0,132,22,2,True,"‘Unmochon’ is designed, a tool that captures authentic evidence and shares with victims’ intended group that may still leave the victim and online gender justice entangled with mob-sentiment, hegemonic legal consciousness, and several privacy aspects.",,,,,1225,1781936874,S.

1227,MultiAzterTest: a Multilingual Analyzer on Multiple Levels of Language for Readability Assessment,"Readability assessment is the task of determining how difficult or easy a text is or which level/grade it has. Traditionally, language dependent readability formula have been used, but these formulae take few text characteristics into account. However, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools that assess the complexity of texts are able to measure more different features and can be adapted to different languages. In this paper, we present the MultiAzterTest tool: (i) an open source NLP tool which analyzes texts on over 125 measures of cohesion, language, and readability for English, Spanish and Basque, but whose architecture is designed to easily adapt other languages; (ii) readability assessment classifiers that improve the performance of Coh-Metrix in English, Coh-Metrix-Esp in Spanish and ErreXail in Basque; iii) a web tool. MultiAzterTest obtains 90.09 % in accuracy when classifying into three reading levels (elementary, intermediate, and advanced) in English and 95.50 % in Basque and 90 % in Spanish when classifying into two reading levels (simple and complex) using a SMO classifier.

1228,Evidentiary activism in the digital age: on the rise of feminist struggles against gender-based online violence,"ABSTRACT Gender-based online violence (GBOV) involves digitally-mediated and -enabled forms of harassment and abuse targeting women, and thus represents a major challenge to feminist movements globally. In this paper, we argue that civil society-based feminist organizations from various parts of the world have responded to this challenge by centring evidence of GBOV in order to develop key though hitherto under-examined epistemic, cultural, and socio-political practices, which we term evidentiary activism. Using a qualitative content analysis of 82 documents produced by feminist organizations, our analysis finds that this activism has two fundamental components. First, feminist organizations engage with existing formal evidentiary cultures by advancing and critiquing legislative and regulatory reforms to address GBOV, platform-based technological ‘solutions,’ and conventional notions of user privacy and anonymity. Second, they embrace and contribute to informal evidentiary cultures, which treat evidence as a tool of cultural and political mobilization against GBOV through strategies of publicization, moral pollution, and the cultivation of feminist digital citizenship. We contend that, akin to evidence-based advocacy that is influential in the fields of biomedicine and health, feminist organizations participate in and invent modes of digitally-oriented evidentiary activism designed to combat GBOV. Feminists’ recasting of the how, why, and what of evidence represents a noteworthy development in struggles against online violence and misogyny, and within digital culture more generally.","Information, Communication & Society",2021.0,76,3,0,False,,,,"F Kurasawa, E Rondinelli… - … , Communication & Society, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'E Rondinelli', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6KYsBYoAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=6KYsBYoAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '6KYsBYoAAAAJ'}]",1228,108637421,Fuyuki Kurasawa,116877112,Elisabeth Rondinelli,1422707277,Gülay Kılıçaslan,,,,,,,Sociology,
1229,A corpus analysis of online news comments using the Appraisal framework,"We present detailed analyses of the distribution of Appraisal categories (Martin and White, 2005) in a corpus of online news comments. The corpus consists of just over one thousand comments posted in response to a variety of opinion pieces on the website of the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. We annotated all the comments with labels corresponding to different categories of the Appraisal framework. Analyses of the annotations show that comments are overwhelmingly negative, and that they favour two of the subtypes of Attitude (Judgment and Appreciation) over the third, Affect. The paper contributes a methodology for annotating Appraisal, and results that show the interaction of Appraisal with negation, the constructive (or not) nature of comments, and the level of toxicity found in them. The results show that highly opinionated language is expressed as an objective opinion (Judgement and Appreciation) rather than an emotional reaction (Affect). This finding, together with the interplay of evaluative language with constructiveness and toxicity in the comments, can be applied to the automatic moderation of comments.",Journal of Corpora and Discourse Studies,2021.0,114,4,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'cardiff.ac.uk', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/140994/1/jcads_4_1_2021_jcads.61.pdf'}]","L Cavasso, M Taboada - Journal of Corpora and Discourse …, 2021 - orca.cardiff.ac.uk","[{'name': 'M Taboada', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37jEMC0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=37jEMC0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '37jEMC0AAAAJ'}]",1229,104238983,Luca Cavasso,145522054,M.

1232,Sexist Myths Emergency Healthcare Professionals and Factors Associated with the Detection of Intimate Partner Violence in Women,"This study analysed the capacity of emergency physicians and nurses working in the city of Granada (Spain) to respond to intimate partner violence (IPV) against women, and the mediating role of certain factors and opinions towards certain sexist myths in the detection of cases. This is a cross-sectional study employing the physician readiness to manage intimate partner violence survey (PREMIS) between October 2020 and January 2021, with 164 surveys analysed. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied, designing three multivariate regression models by considering opinions about different sexist myths. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were considered for the detection of cases. In the past six months, 34.8% of professionals reported that they had identified some cases of IPV, particularly physicians (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.14–5.16; OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.26–5.56). Those who did not express opinions towards sexist myths related to the understanding of the victim or the consideration of alcohol/drug abuse as the main causes of violence and showed a greater probability of detecting a case (NS) (OR = 1.26 and OR = 1.65, respectively).

1234,Culture Industry Reconsidered,"The term culture industry was perhaps used for the first time in the book Dialectic of Enlightenment, which Horkheimer and I published in Amsterdam in 1947. In our drafts we spoke of ""mass culture."" We replaced that expression with ""culture industry"" in order to exclude from the outset the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art. From the latter the culture industry must be distinguished in the extreme. The culture industry fuses the old and familiar into a new quality. In all its branches, products which are tailored for consumption by masses, and which to a great extent determine the nature of that consumption, are manufactured more or less according to plan. The individual branches are similar in structure or at least fit into each other, ordering themselves into a system almost without a gap. This is made possible by contemporary technical capabilities as well as by economic and administrative concentration. The culture industry intentionally integrates its consumers from above. To the detriment of both it forces together the spheres of high and low art, separated for thousands of years. The seriousness of high art is destroyed in speculation about its efficacy; the seriousness of the lower perishes with the civilizational constraints imposed on the rebellious resistance inherent within it as long as social control was not yet total. Thus, although the culture industry undeniably speculates on the conscious and unconscious state of the millions towards which it is directed, the masses are not primary, but secondary, they are an object of calculation; an appendage of the machinery. The customer is not king, as the culture industry would like to have us believe, not its subject but its object. The very word mass-media, specially honed for the culture industry, already shifts the accent onto harmless terrain. Neither is it a question of primary concern for the masses, nor of the techniques of communication as such, but of the spirit which sufflates them, their master's voice. The culture industry misuses its concern for the masses in order to duplicate, reinforce and strengthen their mentality, which it presumes is given and unchangeable. How this mentality might be changed is excluded throughout. The masses are not the measure but the ideology of the culture industry, even though the culture industry itself could scarcely exist without adapting to the masses.",The Culture Industry,2020.0,0,272,12,False,,,,,,1234,98025945,T.

1235,"Gendered Sexual Violence: Betrayal Trauma, Dissociation, and PTSD in Diverse College Students","ABSTRACT Young adults’ transition into college includes risk for onset of mental health problems and sexual violence, particularly for women. Compared to men and boys, women and girls across the lifespan are more likely to be sexually abused, with the perpetrators often being someone close to them. High betrayal trauma is linked to varied mental health outcomes. Despite literature depth, many samples are not ethnically diverse, which results in uncertainty about the generalizability of these findings outside of majority White American populations. The purpose of the current study is to assess gender and high betrayal in sexual violence and mental health outcomes among ethnically diverse college students in the U.S. Participants (N = 368) were ethnically diverse college students attending a public university in the Pacific Northwest, who completed online measures assessing sexual violence and mental health outcomes. When controlling for medium betrayal sexual trauma (perpetrator: unclose other), the associations between high betrayal sexual trauma and dissociation and anxiety, respectively, were moderated by the female gender. The findings point to the utility of relational cultural therapy as a feminist framework that can identify sexism as a contributing factor to young women’s increased risk for sexual violence and associated mental health problems.","Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma",2020.0,69,10,0,False,,,,,,1235,145644835,Jennifer M.

1236,MERLOT: Multimodal Neural Script Knowledge Models,"As humans, we understand events in the visual world contextually, performing multimodal reasoning across time to make inferences about the past, present, and future. We introduce MERLOT, a model that learns multimodal script knowledge by watching millions of YouTube videos with transcribed speech – in an entirely label-free, self-supervised manner. By pretraining with a mix of both framelevel (spatial) and video-level (temporal) objectives, our model not only learns to match images to temporally corresponding words, but also to contextualize what is happening globally over time. As a result, MERLOT exhibits strong out-of-the-box representations of temporal commonsense, and achieves state-ofthe-art performance on 12 different video QA datasets when finetuned. It also transfers well to the world of static images, allowing models to reason about the dynamic context behind visual scenes. On Visual Commonsense Reasoning, MERLOT answers questions correctly with 80.6% accuracy, outperforming stateof-the-art models of similar size by over 3%, even those that make heavy use of auxiliary supervised data (like object bounding boxes). Ablation analyses demonstrate the complementary importance of: 1) training on videos versus static images; 2) scaling the magnitude and diversity of the pretraining video corpus; and 3) using diverse objectives that encourage full-stack multimodal reasoning, from the recognition to cognition level.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2021.0,127,113,23,False,"This work introduces MERLOT, a model that learns multimodal script knowledge by watching millions of YouTube videos with transcribed speech – in an entirely label-free, self-supervised manner, and achieves state-ofthe-art performance on 12 different video QA datasets when finetuned.",,,,,1236,2545335,Rowan Zellers,50085131,Ximing Lu,2689239,Jack Hessel,2111510510,Youngjae Yu,46979645,J.

1238,Trouble in programmer’s paradise: gender-biases in sharing and recognising technical knowledge on Stack Overflow,"ABSTRACT This paper examines gender-biases on Stack Overflow, the world’s largest question-and-answer forum of programming knowledge. Employing a non-binary gender identification built on usernames, I investigate the role of gender in shaping users’ experience in technical forums. The analysis encompasses 11-years of activity, across levels of expertise, language, and specialism, to assess if Stack Overflow is really a paradise for programmers. I first examine individual users, asking if there are gender differences in key user metrics of success, focusing on reputation points, user tenure, and level of activity. Second, I test if there are gender-biases in how technical knowledge is recognised in the question-answer format of the platform. Third, using social network analysis I investigate if interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender. Results show that sharing and recognising technical knowledge is dictated by users’ gender, even when it is operationalised beyond a binary. I find that feminine users receive lower scores for their answers, despite exhibiting higher effort in their contributions. I also show that interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender. Specifically, that feminine users preferentially interact with other feminine users. The findings emphasise the central role of gender in shaping interaction in technical spaces, a necessity for participation in the masculine-dominated forum. I conclude the study with recommendations for inclusivity in online forums.",,2021.0,18,7,0,False,"Results show that sharing and recognising technical knowledge is dictated by users’ gender, even when it is operationalised beyond a binary, and that feminine users preferentially interact with other feminine users on Stack Overflow.",,,,,1238,151201979,S.

In 1972, the Council on Social Work Education appointed the Task Force on Women in Social Work Education to examine the content of program curricula with respect to women’s issues. After seeking input through a national survey of social work education programs, the Task Force developed new curricular resources and advocated policy changes in an effort to ensure that all programs would offer accurate and appropriate information on women. This article reports on the historical textual analysis I conducted using documents from the National Social Welfare History Archives at the University of Minnesota detailing the early work of this Task Force. I identified four themes related to curricular content: women as individuals with power, women as objects, women as problem, and no content on women/unsure of need for content. These findings have implications for social workers and social work educators as they seek to understand the history of the profession, ensure accurate coverage of gendered content in today’s curricula, and meet the challenges of practice in today’s world.",Journal of Social Work Education,2019.0,106,2,0,False,,,,,,1241,117159819,Amanda D.

1246,Prevalence and Correlates of Sex Selling and Sex Purchasing among Adults Seeking Treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder,"Abstract 
 Introduction
 Exchange sex places individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD) at particularly high risk for deleterious safety and health outcomes. A substance use treatment provider who is aware of a patient’s exchange sex behavior is better able to provide appropriate screening, care, and/or referral to risk reduction services. However, little is known about exchange sex, especially purchasing, among treatment-seeking adults with CUD. 
 Method
 The current study examined the prevalence and correlates of sex selling and sex purchasing among treatment-seeking men and women with CUD (n = 109; ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02896712). Separate binary logistic regressions via backward elimination were used to identify best fitting models for sex selling and sex purchasing. 
 Results
 Over 41% of participants endorsed exchange sex within the last 30 days; 20.2% reported selling sex and 30.3% reported purchasing sex. Sex selling and sex purchasing rates differed by gender and race. Number of sexual partners (OR = 5.83, 95% CI = 2.07–16.43), concern about contracting HIV/AIDS (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.31–3.44), cumulative interpersonal trauma exposure (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.20–2.77), years using cocaine (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03–1.20), drug-related problem days (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.00–1.14), and sexual preference (OR = 9.50, 95% CI = .69–130.35) were retained in the final model estimating sex selling (Nagelkerke R 2 = .56). In the final sex purchasing model (Nagelkerke R 2 = .46), gender (OR = 36.17, 95% CI = 2.96–441.75), number of sexual partners (OR = 6.28, 95% CI = 2.69–14.66), number of convictions (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02–1.25), and drug-related problem days (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = .92–1.01) were retained.

1247,Sexual Interaction in Digital Contexts and Its Implications for Sexual Health: A Conceptual Analysis,"Based on its prevalence, there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms, opportunities and risks of sexual interaction in digital contexts (SIDC) that are related with sexual arousal. While there is a growing body of literature on SIDC, there is also a lack of conceptual clarity and classification. Therefore, based on a conceptual analysis, we propose to distinguish between sexual interaction (1) through, (2) via, and (3) with digital technologies. (1) Sexual interactions through digital technologies are face-to-face sexual interactions that (a) have been started digitally (e.g., people initiating face-to-face sexual encounters through adult dating apps) or (b) are accompanied by digital technology (e.g., couples augmenting their face-to-face sexual encounters through filming themselves during the act and publishing the amateur pornography online). (2) Sexual interactions via digital technology are technology-mediated interpersonal sexual interactions (e.g., via text chat: cybersex; via smartphone: sexting; via webcam: webcam sex/camming). (3) Sexual interactions with digital technology occur when the technology itself has the role of an interaction partner (e.g., sexual interaction with a sex robot or with a media persona in pornography). The three types of SIDC and their respective subtypes are explained and backed up with empirical studies that are grouped according to two major mediators: consent and commerce. Regarding the causes and consequences of the three types of SIDC we suggest a classification that entails biological, psychological, social, economic, and technological factors. Regarding implications of SIDC we suggest to focus on both opportunities and risks for sexual health. The proposed conceptual framework of SIDC is meant to inform future research.",Frontiers in Psychology,2021.0,179,6,0,True,,,,,,1247,48648124,N. Döring,1750852,N. Krämer,2142777217,V.

1250,Towards Algorithmic Transparency: A Diversity Perspective,"As the role of algorithmic systems and processes increases in society, so does the risk of bias, which can result in discrimination against individuals and social groups. Research on algorithmic bias has exploded in recent years, highlighting both the problems of bias, and the potential solutions, in terms of algorithmic transparency (AT). Transparency is important for facilitating fairness management as well as explainability in algorithms; however, the concept of diversity, and its relationship to bias and transparency, has been largely left out of the discussion. We reflect on the relationship between diversity and bias, arguing that diversity drives the need for transparency. Using a perspective-taking lens, which takes diversity as a given, we propose a conceptual framework to characterize the problem and solution spaces of AT, to aid its application in algorithmic systems. Example cases from three research domains are described using our framework.",ArXiv,2021.0,43,2,0,False,"A conceptual framework is proposed to characterize the problem and solution spaces of AT, to aid its application in algorithmic systems, and argues that diversity drives the need for transparency.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05658'}]","F Giunchiglia, J Otterbacher, S Kleanthous… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2021 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'F Giunchiglia', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yDTC2DgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=yDTC2DgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'yDTC2DgAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'J Otterbacher', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RWIcc3cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=RWIcc3cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'RWIcc3cAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Kleanthous', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OZlTGmcAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=OZlTGmcAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'OZlTGmcAAAAJ'}]",1250,1720285,Fausto Giunchiglia,2216583,Jahna Otterbacher,2478971,S.

One recourse racialized athletes have at their disposal, however, is active resistance. This paper provides a textual analysis of the intolerable misogynoir aimed at tennis professional Naomi Osaka, and key moments in her media (mis)representations. Results revealed three main themes: (1) ongoing misogynoir and colorism of sport media and athlete sponsors; (2) racial, national and diaspora media (mis)representations; and (3) resistance to gendered racism through self-representation. After Osaka’s historic win at the 2018 US Open, narratives of her Japanese nationality and Asian identity became the story that rendered her Blackness invisible, and enabled her to be read against her opponent Serena Williams. Some information and communication technologies (ICTs), including social media, presented counter-narratives and a recognition of the mainstream media vilification and erasure of Black women. At times, ICTs disrupted racist dominant narratives, and counter-narratives of Osaka’s Blackness and position as part of the Haitian jaspora (diaspora) prevailed.",,2020.0,101,17,1,False,,,,,,1252,2004341067,Sabrina Razack,83652951,J.

1253,Societal Biases in Retrieved Contents: Measurement Framework and Adversarial Mitigation of BERT Rankers,"Societal biases resonate in the retrieved contents of information retrieval (IR) systems, resulting in reinforcing existing stereotypes. Approaching this issue requires established measures of fairness in respect to the representation of various social groups in retrieval results, as well as methods to mitigate such biases, particularly in the light of the advances in deep ranking models. In this work, we first provide a novel framework to measure the fairness in the retrieved text contents of ranking models. Introducing a ranker-agnostic measurement, the framework also enables the disentanglement of the effect on fairness of collection from that of rankers. To mitigate these biases, we propose AdvBert, a ranking model achieved by adapting adversarial bias mitigation for IR, which jointly learns to predict relevance and remove protected attributes. We conduct experiments on two passage retrieval collections (MSMARCO Passage Re-ranking and TREC Deep Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking), which we extend by fairness annotations of a selected subset of queries regarding gender attributes. Our results on the MSMARCO benchmark show that, (1) all ranking models are less fair in comparison with ranker-agnostic baselines, and (2) the fairness of Bert rankers significantly improves when using the proposed AdvBert models. Lastly, we investigate the trade-off between fairness and utility, showing that we can maintain the significant improvements in fairness without any significant loss in utility.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2021.0,82,23,3,True,"AdvBert, a ranking model achieved by adapting adversarial bias mitigation for IR, which jointly learns to predict relevance and remove protected attributes is proposed, and the fairness of Bert rankers significantly improves when using the proposed AdvBert models.",,,,,1253,2844293,Navid Rekabsaz,1689513,Simone Kopeinik,144125621,M.

1254,Narratives of transphobic violence in the Mexican province of Colima: A psychosocial analysis.,"Background
Mexico has the second-highest index of crimes motivated by transphobia in the world. Transphobic violence manifests in a pervasive and complex manner in a country where violence permeates all aspects of social life. Some progress has been made to improve transgender rights and fight discrimination, but this has had an unequal impact in different geopolitical and cultural contexts within the country, particularly outside of metropolitan centers.


Aim
The study explores how transphobia is experienced in the conservative province of Colima and how transphobic practices play a part in shaping transgender subjective experience and identity construction. A psychosocial theoretical framework is adopted to attend to the relationship between cultural, institutional and interpersonal practices in this process.


Methods
A qualitative approach is used to explore how different forms of transphobic violence are experienced by trans women in Colima. A purposive sample of 12 trans women, aged 22-38 years took part in narrative interviews which were analyzed thematically. Findings: The analysis is organized into three themes: (a) narratives of gender identity construction (b) gender expression and experiences of transphobic violence in Colima (c) sites for social support and change.


Discussion
We argue that the psychosocial processes related to transphobia are context-specific shaping transgender identities and limiting and regulating gender expression. Family, education, LGBT community and the police were identified as key sites for support against or source of transphobic violence.

1257,From female computers to male comput♂rs: Or why there are so few women writing algorithms and developing software,"Software development is one of the few professions in Europe and the USA from which women are disappearing. Current explanations range from unproven assumptions that women cannot write algorithms to insights into the misogynistic culture of this profession. This article argues these explanations are inadequate, and illuminates how forms of masculinity constituted within software development put women in the ambivalent position of being either female or a coder, but not both. Using a poststructural theoretical position to analyse materials from a qualitative, interview-based study, we identified three constitutive ontologies of the person circulating within the profession. The Comput♂r is presumptively male and can merge with the machine, although a subset, Geeks, cannot demerge from it. The Human, presumptively female, can communicate with people but not the machine. The Ideal developer claims the best of both, that is, adept at writing algorithms and communicating with people. These ontologies are informed by a theory of the body circulating within software development whose norms are unattainable by women. Female bodies are envisaged as ‘flesh’, and male bodies as a futuristic merger of body and machine. This Janus-faced theory excludes female developers from practising their profession.",,2020.0,79,7,0,True,"This article illuminates how forms of masculinity constituted within software development put women in the ambivalent position of being either female or a coder, but not both and identifies three constitutive ontologies of the person circulating within the profession.",,,,,1257,2086527,R.

Specifically, we investigate the relationship between campaign messaging strategies, such as advocacy and attacks, and the presence of incivility in public comments. We find that Trump dominated both in terms of number of posts and of public conversation and was the least likely to receive uncivil comments. Attack messages by the candidates were more likely to receive uncivil comments, suggesting that campaign negativity may indeed affect how the public engages with candidates online.

1260,Pitching Gender in a Racist Tune: The Affective Publics of the #120decibel Campaign,"This article analyses the changed structures, actors and modes of communication that characterise ‘dissonant public spheres.’ With the #120decibel campaign by the German Identitarian Movement in 2018, gender and migration were pitched in a racist tune, absorbing feminist concerns and positions into neo-nationalistic, misogynist and xenophobic propaganda. The article examines the case of #120decibel as an instance of ‘affective publics’ (Lunenborg, 2019a) where forms of feminist protest and emancipatory hashtag activism are absorbed by anti-migration campaigners. Employing the infrastructure and network logics of social media platforms, the campaign gained public exposure and sought political legitimacy through strategies of dissonance, in which a racial solidarity against the liberal state order was formed. Parallel structures of networking and echo-chamber amplification were established, where right-wing media articulate fringe positions in an attempt to protect the rights of white women to be safe in public spaces. #120decibel is analysed and discussed here as characteristic of the ambivalent role and dynamics of affective publics in societies challenged by an increasing number of actors forming an alliance on anti-migration issues based on questionable feminist positions.",,2021.0,53,4,0,True,,,,,,1260,90039516,S.

Additionally, prior research has shown that Jamaican men reliably report more anti-gay prejudice than Jamaican women do. This study investigated potential explanations for these gender differences. Using a large, diverse data set (N = 659), we found that Jamaican men reported more anti-gay behaviour than women did, but this difference was largest under conditions of lower income, less education and younger age. Also, in line with our hypotheses, religiosity and preferences for dancehall music did not moderate the effects of gender on anti-gay behaviour. These findings suggest that Jamaican men’s anti-gay prejudice may be driven, at least in part, by motivations to bolster their masculinity in the face of underlying contemporary threats.

In the male-dominated sphere of esports, the underrepresentation of women and nonbinary people often leaves these marginalized groups invisible, with a significant lack of women and nonbinary people competing in top-tier tournaments. We highlight the experience of Wang ‘BaiZe’ Xinyu, a Chinese Hearthstone player who became the first woman to compete in a Hearthstone Championship Tour event in the game’s 3-year history. The narrative surrounding BaiZe’s participation largely focused on her gender and ignored the achievements that led her to qualify for the event. We argue that BaiZe’s entrance to the championship scene was received negatively by both competitors and spectators, reinforcing barriers that exclude women and nonbinary people from entering this male-dominated space.

After making judgments of guilt, participants completed measures on sexism, homonegativity, transphobia, and trust in legal authorities. Jurors were more likely to believe transgender heterosexual females were guilty when compared to cisgender heterosexual females, but were not more likely to believe cisgender gay males were guilty compared to cisgender heterosexual females.

1266,Rejecting Test Surveillance in Higher Education,"The rise of remote proctoring software during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the dangers of surveillance-enabled pedagogy built on the belief that students can’t be trusted. These services, which deploy a range of identification protocols, computer and internet access limitations, and human or automated observation of students as they take tests remotely, are marketed as necessary to prevent cheating. But the success of these services in their stated goal is ill- supported at best and discredited at worst, particularly given their highly over- inclusive criteria for “suspicious” behavior. Meanwhile, the harms they inflict on students are clear: severe anxiety among test-takers, concerning data collection and use practices, and discriminatory flagging of students of color and students with disabilities have provoked widespread outcry from students, professors, privacy advocates, policymakers, and sometimes universities themselves. To make matters worse, the privacy and civil rights laws most relevant to the use of these services are generally inadequate to protect students from the harms they inflict. 
 
Colleges and universities routinely face difficult decisions that require reconciling conflicting interests, but whether to use remote proctoring software isn’t one of them. Remote proctoring software is not pedagogically beneficial, institutionally necessary, or remotely unavoidable, and its use further entrenches inequities in higher education that schools should be devoted to rooting out. Colleges and universities should abandon remote proctoring software, and apply the lessons from this failed experiment to their other existing or potential future uses of surveillance technologies and automated decision-making systems that threaten students’ privacy, access to important life opportunities, and intellectual freedom.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2021.0,46,4,0,False,,,,"L Barrett - Available at SSRN 3871423, 2021 - papers.ssrn.com","[{'name': 'L Barrett', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BwbZGsoAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=BwbZGsoAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'BwbZGsoAAAAJ'}]",1266,50541610,Lindsey Barrett,,,,,,,,,,,Business,

Yet there is a lack of research describing what such SRC teaching and learning actively involve and look like, particularly in K-12 classrooms. This paper fills this gap with findings from a research-practice partnership, through a qualitative study in an Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles classroom enrolling low-income Latino/a/x students from a large urban community. The findings illustrate 1) details of teaching practice and student learning during discussions about SRC; 2) the impact these SRC experiences have on student engagement with CS; 3) a teacher's reflections on key considerations for effective SRC pedagogy; and 4) why students’ perspectives and agency must be centered through SRC in computing education.",ACM Transactions on Computing Education,2021.0,88,0,0,False,Findings from a research-practice partnership are filled with findings from a qualitative study in an Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles classroom enrolling low-income Latino/a/x students from a large urban community.,,,"JJ Ryoo, A Morris, J Margolis - ACM Transactions on Computing …, 2021 - dl.acm.org","[{'name': 'JJ Ryoo', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rBagnPgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=rBagnPgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'rBagnPgAAAAJ'}]",1267,143830546,Jean J.

1268,Uncertain Decisions Facilitate Better Preference Learning,"Existing observational approaches for learning human preferences, such as inverse reinforcement learning, usually make strong assumptions about the observability of the human’s environment. However, in reality, people make many important decisions under uncertainty. To better understand preference learning in these cases, we study the setting of inverse decision theory (IDT), a previously proposed framework where a human is observed making non-sequential binary decisions under uncertainty. In IDT, the human’s preferences are conveyed through their loss function, which expresses a tradeoff between different types of mistakes. We give the first statistical analysis of IDT, providing conditions necessary to identify these preferences and characterizing the sample complexity—the number of decisions that must be observed to learn the tradeoff the human is making to a desired precision. Interestingly, we show that it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is more uncertain. Furthermore, uncertain decision problems allow us to relax the unrealistic assumption that the human is an optimal decision maker but still identify their exact preferences; we give sample complexities in this suboptimal case as well. Our analysis contradicts the intuition that partial observability should make preference learning more difficult. It also provides a first step towards understanding and improving preference learning methods for uncertain and suboptimal humans.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2021.0,59,4,0,False,"It is shown that it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is more uncertain, which contradicts the intuition that partial observability should make preference learning more difficult.",,"[{'title': 'neurips.cc', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/7f141cf8e7136ce8701dc6636c2a6fe4-Paper.pdf'}]","C Laidlaw, S Russell - Advances in Neural Information …, 2021 - proceedings.neurips.cc","[{'name': 'C Laidlaw', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DzeJ67UAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=DzeJ67UAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'DzeJ67UAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Russell', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2oy3OXYAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=2oy3OXYAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '2oy3OXYAAAAJ'}]",1268,114339785,Cassidy Laidlaw,145107462,Stuart J.

With the likely consumer market for these devices among white, male, heterosexual sex-doll owners, their views about sex robot technology and the niche online communities in which they discuss their doll relationships have received little scholarly attention. Through a qualitative analysis of the discursive practices of male users of a major sex doll forum, this study found complex and dynamic homosocial relations characterized men’s online interactions. In their discussion of a sex robot future, men negotiate competing structures of masculinity and sexuality and create a safe, online space for others to express their sexual desires and preferences.

1270,"Social Work Education that Addresses Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation: An intersectional, anti-oppressive practice framework","Practice, policy, and research focused on trafficking for sexual exploitation and commercial sex involvement occur in the United States within a white, heteronormative social environment that must be addressed pedagogically in the classroom. Social work education increasingly includes the topic of trafficking for sexual exploitation as a stand-alone course or as sessions embedded within other courses. Yet, very little scholarship critically examines how instruction in social work on this topic can apply intersectional, anti-oppressive frameworks across micro, mezzo, and macro levels. Furthermore, current literature suggests that some social workers use exclusionary practices when addressing trafficking and commercial sex involvement, further exemplifying the need for anti-oppressive curricula. The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse how key anti-oppressive theoretical and practice frameworks should influence education on trafficking for sexual exploitation and commercial sex involvement in social work. Written by two scholars and social work instructors, we describe how we apply these frameworks to pedagogical exercises in social work courses. Finally, we argue that intersectional, anti-oppressive social work education is critical to training social work students and, ultimately, addressing the needs of people experiencing or at risk of trafficking.",Anti-Trafficking Review,2021.0,2,0,0,True,,,,,,1270,11856122,Lara B.

1271,Stop the Machines: How Emerging Technologies are Fomenting the War on Civilization,"ABSTRACT The Fourth Industrial Revolution promises to transform contemporary societies. Similarly, emerging technologies are affording countless new applications that assure an overall and widespread improvement of living standards. At the same time, their potential misuse has sparked concerns. In particular, the possibility of terrorist organizations adopting such technologies has dominated the scholarly debate. Consequently, there is a growing literature that deals with the motivational and technical factors potentially underlying the malevolent resort to emerging technologies. Enthusiasm for emerging technologies is, however, only one side of the coin. The last decade has, indeed, witnessed a re-emergence of forms of Neo-Luddism. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of these developments is still lacking. This paper investigates and maps the main debates and dynamics in the Anti-Technology Movement in order to understand the rationale behind—and the prospects of—this resurgence. In doing so, it focuses on two radical fringes, namely the Insurrectionary Anarchist Milieu and the Radical Environmentalist Milieu. The paper argues that, although based on different narratives and end goals, these milieus share a similar commitment and operational approaches as well as a marked apocalyptic millenarian thinking that has set them on an escalatory path.",Terrorism and Political Violence,2021.0,67,1,0,False,,,,,,1271,2087464233,Mauro Lubrano,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

The study, which was informed by a sociological framework, employed a qualitative approach using 28 semi-structured interviews and five focus groups. The findings reveal that despite the high frequency of the victimisation, and despite the awareness among respondents that antisemitism has seen a resurgence in recent years, Orthodox Jews have managed to accept the victimisation. The way the Orthodox Jewish community has managed their victimisation of antisemitism is argued to be profoundly different from the dominant narratives of hate crime victims, in that by and large the majority of respondents accepted their victimisation. It proposes that respondents were able to show agency and to normalise the victimisation because of their strong religious identity and close community ties.",,2021.0,62,0,0,True,,,,,,1272,144673003,Maya Flax,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,JournalArticle
1273,Body politics and the politics of technology: technological experiences among street-based sex workers in Bangalore,"Abstract This paper illustrates how body politics and the politics of technology compound one another for female street-based sex workers (FSSWs) in Bangalore city, India, in their experiences of three technologies – mobile phones, CCTV surveillance, and television media. Mobile phones have emerged as an integral part of street-based sex work in Bangalore as a result of FSSWs abstaining from public spaces that have been overwhelmingly eroded due to urban transition and gentrification over the last two decades in Bangalore, as well as due to their inherent advantages. Simultaneously, intensified CCTV surveillance of city spaces keeps watch on them, while native-language television media, a techno-cultural predator, routinely conducts self-assigned gentrification operations covertly or overtly discovering and publicly disseminating information on immorality and delinquency. All three technological experiences understandably have had complicated fallouts for FSSWs, a result of the politics of technology that are at the foundations of these experiences.","Gender, Technology and Development",2021.0,97,0,0,False,,,,"A Kamath, P Neethi - Gender, Technology and Development, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'A Kamath', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c9dcUDIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=c9dcUDIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'c9dcUDIAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'P Neethi', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fsmkHm0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=fsmkHm0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'fsmkHm0AAAAJ'}]",1273,1705980,Anant Kamath,100585507,P.

1274,"""There's a problem, now what's the solution?"": suggestions for technologies to support the menopausal transition from individuals experiencing menopause and healthcare practitioners","OBJECTIVE
To elicit novel ideas for informatics solutions to support individuals through the menopausal transition. (Note: We use ""individuals experiencing menopause"" and ""experiences"" rather than ""symptoms"" when possible to counter typical framing of menopause as a cisgender women's medical problem.).


METHODS
A participatory design study was conducted 2015-2017 in the Western US. Two sessions were held with individuals experiencing menopause recruited from the general public; and 3 sessions with healthcare practitioners (HCPs) including nurses, physicians, and complementary and integrative health (CIH) practitioners were held. Participants designed technologies addressing informational needs and burdensome experiences. HCPs reflected on designs from participants experiencing menopause. Directed content analysis was used to analyze transcripts.


RESULTS
Eight individuals experiencing menopause (n = 4 each session) and 18 HCPs (n = 10 CIH, n = 3 nurses, n = 5 physicians) participated. All participants provided ideas for solution purpose, hardware, software, features and functions, and data types. Individuals experiencing menopause designed technologies to help understand and prevent burdensome menopause experiences. HCPs designed technologies for tracking and facilitating communication. Compared to nurses and physicians, CIH practitioners suggested designs reframing menopause as a positive experience and accounted for the complex lives of individuals experiencing menopause, including stigma; these ideas corresponded to comments made by participants experiencing menopause. Participants from both populations were concerned about data confidentiality and technology accessibility.

Participant generated design ideas included novel ideas and incorporated existing technologies.

1275,Interpersonal Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder among Black Women: Does Racial Discrimination Matter?,"ABSTRACT There is evidence that the more frequent, severe, and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology experienced by Black compared to White individuals cannot be explained by disparities in socioeconomic status or trauma exposure. One factor that may be important to consider is racial discrimination, which is associated with numerous negative mental health outcomes yet has not been studied in the context of interpersonal traumas for Black women. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the independent and interactive roles of racial discrimination and interpersonal trauma in predicting PTSD symptoms in a community sample of trauma-exposed, Black women (n = 292). Consistent with the previous literature, we found that more frequent experiences of racial discrimination were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms overall (r = .34) and by symptom cluster. Furthermore, we found a significant interaction between experiences of racial discrimination and experiences of interpersonal trauma (b = .46, 95%CI[.04, .88], SE = .28; ΔR 2 = .01, p = .03) such that the association between PTSD symptoms and interpersonal trauma was stronger at higher (+1 SD above the mean) levels of racial discrimination. This pattern was replicated for most PTSD symptom clusters. These results suggest that racial discrimination experiences exacerbate the association between interpersonal traumatic experiences and PTSD symptoms among Black women.",Journal of Trauma & Dissociation,2021.0,0,17,0,False,The results suggest that racial discrimination experiences exacerbate the association between interpersonal traumatic experiences and PTSD symptoms among Black women.,,,,,1275,5581491,Y.

1276,The future of sperm: a biovariability framework for understanding global sperm count trends,"Abstract The past 50 years have seen heated debate in the reproductive sciences about global trends in human sperm count. In 2017, Levine and colleagues published the largest and most methodologically rigorous meta-regression analysis to date and reported that average total sperm concentration among men from ‘Western’ countries has decreased by 59.3% since 1973, with no sign of halting. These results reverberated in the scientific community and in public discussions about men and masculinity in the modern world, in part because of scientists’ public-facing claims about the societal implications of the decline of male fertility. We find that existing research follows a set of implicit and explicit assumptions about how to measure and interpret sperm counts, which collectively form what we term the Sperm Count Decline hypothesis (SCD). Using the study by Levine and colleagues, we identify weaknesses and inconsistencies in the SCD, and propose an alternative framework to guide research on sperm count trends: the Sperm Count Biovariability hypothesis (SCB). SCB asserts that sperm count varies within a wide range, much of which can be considered non-pathological and species-typical. Knowledge about the relationship between individual and population sperm count and life-historical and ecological factors is critical to interpreting trends in average sperm counts and their relationships to health and fertility.",Human Fertility,2021.0,116,15,2,False,"Using the study by Levine and colleagues, weaknesses and inconsistencies are identified, and an alternative framework to guide research on sperm count trends is proposed: the Sperm Count Biovariability hypothesis (SCB), which asserts that sperm count varies within a wide range, much of which can be considered non-pathological and species-typical.",,"[{'title': 'tandfonline.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14647273.2021.1917778'}]","M Boulicault, M Perret, J Galka, A Borsa… - Human …, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'M Boulicault', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ym_WvysAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=ym_WvysAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'ym_WvysAAAAJ'}]",1276,103411794,M.

1277,Liu Cixin's Three-Body Trilogy and the Status of Science Fiction in Contemporary China,"Abstract:The recent success of Liu Cixin's hard sf trilogy Santi [The Three-Body Trilogy, 2006-2008] is symbolic of the important rise of Chinese science fiction both in China and in the rest of the world. This trilogy tells the story of the future invasion of Earth by a belligerent extraterrestrial civilization with advanced technology and the ways in which humans try to defend themselves. It begins with the Chinese Cultural Revolution and ends with the heat death of the universe. A huge bestseller and great critical success, it is also being adapted to film. The English translation of the first volume also won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2015. With the considerable success he achieved with this trilogy, Liu Cixin has become for the readers, critics, and supporters of Chinese soft power the standard-bearer of a new “era” of Chinese science fiction, called upon to promote the “Chinese dream” to the international community. In light of the history of science fiction in China since 1949 and its political reappropriation, this present contribution offers an examination of the conditions of production and reception of The Three-Body Trilogy in China and abroad and details the reasons for the critical, academic, and even political passion that it arouses today.",Science Fiction Studies,2022.0,42,3,0,False,,,,,,1277,2084191709,Gwennaël Gaffric,116036548,W.

1279,Human Enhancements and Voting: Towards a Declaration of Rights and Responsibilities of Beings,"The phenomenon and ethics of “voting” will be explored in the context of human enhancements. “Voting” will be examined for enhanced humans with moderate and extreme enhancements. Existing patterns of discrimination in voting around the globe could continue substantially “as is” for those with moderate enhancements. For extreme enhancements, voting rights could be challenged if the very humanity of the enhanced was in doubt. Humans who were not enhanced could also be disenfranchised if certain enhancements become prevalent. Voting will be examined using a theory of engagement articulated by Professor Sophie Loidolt that emphasizes the importance of legitimization and justification by “facing the appeal of the other” to determine what is “right” from a phenomenological first-person perspective. Seeking inspiration from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948, voting rights and responsibilities will be re-framed from a foundational working hypothesis that all enhanced and non-enhanced humans should have a right to vote directly. Representative voting will be considered as an admittedly imperfect alternative or additional option. The framework in which voting occurs, as well as the processes, temporal cadence, and role of voting, requires the participation from as diverse a group of humans as possible. Voting rights delivered by fiat to enhanced or non-enhanced humans who were excluded from participation in the design and ratification of the governance structure is not legitimate.

Following Lokumage’s original usage of the term, this paper explores ‘obstetric iatrogenesis’ along a spectrum ranging from unintentional harm (UH) to overt disrespect, violence, and abuse (DVA), employing the acronym ‘UHDVA’ for this spectrum. This paper draws attention to the systemic maltreatment rooted in the technocratic model of birth, which includes UH normalized forms of mistreatment that childbearers and providers may not recognize as abusive. Equally, this paper assesses how obstetric iatrogenesis disproportionately impacts Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), contributing to worse perinatal outcomes for BIPOC childbearers. Much of the work on ‘obstetric violence’ that documents the most detrimental end of the UHDVA spectrum has focused on low-to-middle income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

1282,COVID-19 anti-Asian racism: A tripartite model of collective psychosocial resilience.,"Anti-Asian racism has spiked since the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, creating compounded threats to Asian Americans' psychological wellbeing on top of other pandemic stressors (e.g., fears of infection, financial insecurity, or quarantine isolation). COVID-19 anti-Asian racism signifies the relevance of race and racism during public health crises and highlights the importance of examining the psychological impacts of racialized stress and avenues for resilience during a pandemic. This article describes a conceptual model that emphasizes the importance of rechanneling the experience of COVID-19 anti-Asian racism toward resilience. Specifically, the proposed model identifies a tripartite process of collective psychosocial resilience, comprised of (a) critical consciousness of discrimination as a common fate, (b) critical consciousness-informed racial/ethnic identity, and (c) advocacy, for empowering Asian Americans and protecting them against the harmful effects of COVID-19 anti-Asian racism during and beyond the pandemic. Theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the proposed tripartite process for cultivating resilience against COVID-19 anti-Asian racism are delineated.

In comparison with static factors associated with intimate partner violence, there is a dearth of research on dynamic factors. Targeting dynamic correlates of attitudes toward intimate partner violence is advantageous for the reduction of risk. This study examined how unmet interpersonal needs (i.e., perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) are associated with accepting attitudes toward intimate partner violence in 137 women seeking help from a domestic violence shelter.

1284,Measuring management and leadership competencies of business school educated managers in South Africa,"This paper explores a model to measure managerial and leadership competence of business school educated managers. It starts by reviewing the literature on general management and leadership, seeking to establish a broad theoretical framework to guide this study. After statistically ensuring that the respective theoretical measuring criteria selected do measure the specific management and leadership competency, the paper then presents a model to measure management and leadership competencies. The final model has a total of eleven management and leadership competencies. These are Personal Value System, Career Awareness, Ethical and External Influences, Leading Change, Cultural Sensitivity, Team Building, Strategic Leadership, Conflict Management, Communication Skills, Global Leadership Mindset and Emotional Intelligence. This paper goes on to statistically measure the management and leadership competencies while also determining if the demographic variables influence the management and leadership competencies in any way. Also, the paper seeks to determine if any significant correlations exist between management and leadership competencies. The results of this study are of value to business school educated managers who aim to improve their managerial and leadership skills. It is also of value to researchers and scholars who intend to explore this avenue of managerial and leadership competency models further. Corresponding author: Christo A Bisschoff Email addresses for corresponding author: Christo.bisschoff@nwu.ac.za First submission received: 8th February 2018 Revised submission received: 25th April 2018 Accepted: 22nd May 2018 Introduction In the current highly integrated global economy where many organisations operate across multiple geographies, the importance of a talented and competent workforce is axiomatic. Competent employees are not only central to productive and enriched work environments but also contribute to prosperous outcomes for organisational performance. These, and other, business environmental issues have generated an urgency among organisations to build their executive teams with the requisite managerial and leadership competencies, so that these competencies can be deployed in a manner that achieves superior individual and organisational performance. Previous studies in the field of work-based competencies demonstrate a link between managerial and leadership competencies, and superior executive performance. Following the formalisation of management and leadership competencies as a managerial concept, management and leadership competencies have gained significant impetus as a substantive management focus area in recent human resource management literature (Lewis, Donaldson-Feilder and Tharani, 2012; Sinh, 2016; Bagraim et al., 2016). The concept of competency-based human resources has been explored seminally by David McClelland (1973). Since then it has moved from a novel approach to widespread practice in the last four decades since McClelland first proposed it as a key differentiator of performance. According to research in this area by Analoui and Hosseini (2001) and later by Boyatzis and Ratti (2009), managerial effectiveness is Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 13 Issue 2 December 2018 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 153 strongly correlated to organisational effectiveness and economic performance. In this respect, Analoui and Hosseini (2001) argued that competent managers and leaders have played a significant role in the overall success of their organisations and development of their societies. In an earlier study, Boyatzis and Case (1989) found that management educated graduates, and more specifically MBA graduates, displayed a greater number of skills and competencies related to effective managerial performance. Later, as more studies were completed (Analoui and Hosseini, 2001; Mintzberg, 2004, 2005, 2008; Camuffo et al., 2009), patterns of managerial and leadership competencies could be observed that recurrently appeared to distinguish exceptional performers. This led to the development of numerous competency models; this avenue of research is even more relevant today where managers are confronted by the disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Cornellissen, 2017). Most recently though, relentless change within and outside organisational boundaries, coupled with volatility and uncertainty in the general business environment, has forced managers and leaders to rethink organisational design and the managerial skills sets required to succeed under such circumstances. In this regard, Hoffmann (2016) warns that conventional organisational structures with multiple hierarchical levels will disappear in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In line with this view, Truxillo, Bauer and Erdogan (2016) confirm that the modern organisation has to develop and learn continuously and that the shifting organisational boundaries will lead to adjusted organisational structures. One key aspect, as highlighted by Sinh (2016:14), is that, in contrast to a conventional executive, effective contemporary leaders are characterised by their openness and willingness to embrace change and innovation. Thus, with the acceleration in innovation and massive disruptions in global business brought about by the digital economy, Cornellissen (2017) warns that managers and leaders must have the skills and competencies to identify managerial problems and know suitable strategies to fix them. Given this background, the purpose of this study is to measure management and leadership competencies of business school educated managers in South Africa. The current study also attempts to determine if significant correlations exist between the demographic variables and management and leadership competencies as well as determine if significant correlations exist between the management and leadership competencies. Problem Statement The profile of the 21st century workplace is undergoing large-scale and fundamental changes. Managers, therefore, have to operate in a complex environment and are required to respond rapidly to demands that are, at most times, unpredictable (Bagraim et al., 2016). In recent years though, there has been a rising surge of contemporary criticisms of management education as well as approaches to management and leadership development (Varela, Burke and Norbit, 2013). A number of these post-2000 studies assert inadequacies in the development of managerial skills and competencies (Mintzberg, 2004; Pfeffer and Fong, 2004). The seminal claim by one of the pioneering proponents holding this view, Mintzberg (2004:199) stated that “management education sits worlds apart from that of management development”. Despite the growing concerns about the impact of graduate management education, Boyatzis and Case (1989) argued that few studies have measured their impact on the development of students’ managerial and leadership competencies. Here Camuffo et al. (2009) contend that even in instances where researchers support the hypothesis that management education leads to enhanced managerial performance, measurement of the specific skills and competencies associated with such management education remains somewhat hazy and unclear. This is especially true in the South African context where, apart from studies by Thekiso (2011) and Shaikh (2013), there is a dearth of such scientific and empirical research. This article, therefore, addresses this specific problem of measuring management and leadership competencies amongst business school educated managers in South Africa. Research Objectives The primary objective of this article is to measure management and leadership competencies of business school educated managers in South Africa. Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 13 Issue 2 December 2018 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 154 This primary objective is achieved by addressing the following secondary objectives: Theoretically study management and leadership; Ensure the relevancy of of the theoretically selected measuring criteria; and Empirically measure the competencies and demographic profiles of the respondents. Theory on Management and Leadership To ground the theoretical framework of this study, literature is presented on the role of management and leadership in organisations, with brief discussions on the nature of management and the nature of leadership. Second, a brief debate on whether management and leadership are theoretically a different or interrelated concept is presented, explaining the various paradigms held by diverse researchers and scholars. Lastly, an attempt is made to reconcile the long-standing debate around whether effective management and leadership are all about nature or nurture. The role of management and leadership in organisations The challenges of being an effective manager have never been greater. In a globalised economy that is characterised by rapid advances in technology and hyper-competition, organisations have become highly complex and exposed to constant change. Smit, Botha and Vrba (2016) suggest that, in addition to dealing with issues such as climate change, sustainability, business ethics and corporate governance, present-day managers must also be sensitive to cultural differences that are central to doing business around the globe. In the South African environment specifically, Smit et al. (2016) go on to argue that organisational managers are facing even greater challenges such as a politically turbulent environment characterised by corruption and bribery. Coupled with these challenges, a very tough labour market, a volatile public higher education sector and Black Economic Empowerment transformation charters for almost every sector of the South African economy, managers have to reflect on sound management principles",Journal of Business & Retail Management Research,2018.0,54,3,0,True,,,,,,1284,100905845,A.

1285,How Do Women’s Attitudes Towards Heterosexual Men Differ By Their Sexual Orientation? A Test of Competing Hypotheses,"ABSTRACT Though feminist theory asserts that women’s sexuality influences their general relationship with heterosexual men, the leading psychological measure of women’s attitudes towards heterosexual men, the Ambivalence towards Men Inventory (AMI), has not yet accounted for sexual orientation as a meaningful individual difference. In this current United States-based research (N = 318), we revisited the AMI to examine women’s attitudes towards heterosexual men as a function of women’s sexual orientation (i.e. lesbian, bisexual, or heterosexual). Drawing from feminist and psychological theories of attitudes towards men, we 1) tested competing hypotheses regarding whether lesbian and bisexual women or heterosexual women would be highest in hostility, and 2) hypothesised that heterosexual women would hold more benevolent attitudes than lesbian and bisexual women. When controlling for feminist identity, lesbian women held more hostile attitudes towards heterosexual men, specifically on subscales of Resentment of Paternalism and Heterosexual Hostility. However, there were no differences in benevolence towards heterosexual men between groups. We discuss hostility as a reaction to gendered oppression and the utility of benevolence in modern times. Testing the AMI with a sexually diverse sample reveals nuanced understandings of intergroup relations and demonstrates a need to establish more inclusive measures of gendered attitudes.",Psychology & Sexuality,2021.0,32,0,0,False,,,,,,1285,1896037903,M.

1286,‘Choice’ in occupational therapy theory: A critique from the situation of patriarchy in India,"Abstract Background: Dominant occupational therapy theories assert that people choose their daily occupations, and participate in occupations as autonomous agents; yet scholars insist that choices are socially-structured and inequitably available. Aim: To critically review the concept of choice in occupational therapy theory through an exploration of patriarchy in India. Material and methods: Drawing from scholarly work that addresses patriarchy in India, we employ the commonly-used occupational categories of self-care, productivity and leisure as a framework to explore the real availability of occupational choices for women. Results: Patriarchal ideology perpetuates inequitable power dynamics within Indian society. As a consequence, women, children and non-dominant men have few opportunities to make or enact occupational choices that impact their wellbeing and their lives. Conclusions: The examples provided in this paper challenge those occupational therapy theories that portray occupational engagement as the product of individual volition and unconstrained choice. Significance: Dominant occupational therapy theories are informed by specific Western assumptions that may have little relevance to people in other contexts. Critical approaches to professional assumptions are essential to avoid the imperialistic imposition of irrelevant theories, and the development and delivery of services that may be oppressive for clients who have few opportunities to make occupational choices.",Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy,2020.0,50,10,0,False,The concept of choice in occupational therapy theory is critically reviewed through an exploration of patriarchy in India to challenge those occupational therapy theories that portray occupational engagement as the product of individual volition and unconstrained choice.,,,,,1286,119209736,Kavitha Murthi,3874566,K.

1287,Homonational tongue?,"
 This ethnographic writing animates the communal role of language through
 onē-kotoba (queen’s language) among Ni-chōme volleyballers (amateur volleyball-loving gay
 men in Tokyo). This gayly effeminate speech style remains firmly entrenched in Japanese media-representations of gay male
 characters despite its alleged rejection by actual gay men as well as its problematic characterization as being disrespectful to
 women. By adopting an ethnographic approach anchored in performance studies, I address
 onē-kotoba not in media but one real, perhaps unexpected, context of use. As Ni-chōme
 volleyballers swing between discretion and disclosure by fashioning language(/gender), such tactical performance of
 onē-kotoba lubricates an aesthetically pro-silence erotic play in tension with Japan’s –
 retrospectively and arguably – family-oriented, if not homophobic, sociocultural orientation resistant to “out-and-proud”
 activism. Overall, this ethnographic research highlights the enduring difficulty of radical coalition among diverse populations,
 as I spotlight Ni-chōme volleyballers by discussing what has been in Japan in relation to the Euro-American resistance-minded

1288,Perceiving an ambiguous situation as sexual harassment: the influence of observer and harasser gender,"ABSTRACT This study examined the influence of observer 1 and harasser gender on perceiving an ambiguous situation as sexual harassment. A total of 417 Israelis were exposed to a screenshot of WhatsApp correspondence identical in its content but for describing a male or female harasser. Using an experimental manipulation, harasser gender was manipulated so that half of the participants were exposed to either a male or female harasser. Next, their perception of the situation as sexual harassment was measured. As hypothesized, we found that women tended to interpret the situation as harassment more often than men. Additionally, as hypothesized, the male character was interpreted more often as sexually harassing. We also found an interaction between observer gender and harasser gender, but not in the expected direction: women tended to judge both male and female harassers severely but relatively equally, whereas men tended to judge only the male harasser severely. These findings imply that men were affected by gender schemas and stereotypes more than were women, whose judgement tended to be more objective. Practically, this means that although much has changed in recent years, including in particular the #MeToo campaign, sexual harassment is still affected by gender schemas and stereotypes and still reflects an unequal gender distribution of power.",Journal of Gender Studies,2021.0,62,1,1,False,,,,"P Harush, S Elikishvili… - Journal of Gender Studies, 2021 - Taylor & Francis",,1288,2140891031,Priel Harush,2140896890,Sarit Elikishvili,1455792988,Oshrit Kaspi-Baruch,,,,,,,Psychology,
1289,"The gender-affirmative life span approach: A developmental model for clinical work with transgender and gender-diverse children, adolescents, and adults.","The gender-affirmative life span approach (GALA) is an innovative therapeutic framework for promoting the mental health of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) clients of all ages. Based in interdisciplinary philosophical foundations, GALA proposes that TGD clients can be supported in psychotherapy through (a) developing gender literacy, (b) building resiliency, (c) moving beyond the binary, (d) exploring pleasure-oriented sexuality, and (e) making connections to medical interventions. Psychotherapy incorporating these 5 core components is developmentally tailored for children, adolescents, young adults, or older adults. Developing gender literacy is the process of understanding how sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation are distinct but interconnected concepts, as well as learning to identify oppressive practices in TGD people's lives. Building resiliency involves learning how to overcome adversity and effectively cope with challenging situations in life. Resiliency-building also involves having social support networks to share these difficulties and gain support. Gender and sexual binaries pathologize nonconformity and limit the full range of healthy gender and sexual expression. Moving beyond the binary to a spectrum approach allows for the inclusion and affirmation of all gender identities and expressions. Unfortunately, research and practice have largely focused on negative sexual outcomes for TGD people. Thus, age-appropriate psychotherapy aimed at developing sex-positive pleasure and satisfaction is critical. Lastly, gender-competent mental health practitioners need to have knowledge about, and skills to refer for, medical interventions, when appropriate.

1290,“I Need You All to Understand How Pervasive This Issue Is”: User Efforts to Regulate Child Sexual Offending on Social Media,"This chapter examines the phenomenon of internet users attempting to report and prevent online child sexual exploitation (CSE) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in the absence of adequate intervention by internet service providers, social media platforms, and government. The chapter discusses the history of online CSE, focusing on regulatory stances over time in which online risks to children have been cast as natural and inevitable by the hegemony of a “cyberlibertarian” ideology. We illustrate the success of this ideology, as well as its profound contradictions and ethical failures, by presenting key examples in which internet users have taken decisive action to prevent online CSE and promote the removal of CSAM. Rejecting simplistic characterizations of “vigilante justice,” we argue instead that the fact that often young internet users report feeling forced to act against online CSE and CSAM undercuts libertarian claims that internet regulation is impossible, unworkable, and unwanted. Recent shifts toward a more progressive ethos of online harm minimization are promising; however, this ethos risks offering a new legitimizing ideology for online business models that will continue to put children at risk of abuse and exploitation.

1291,Organization Structures in new age Organization and Organizations of the Future,"Organizations are feeling the dawn of the social era all around them and have very few leaders who can help them chart through the rapid swirls of change. Through this article, we hope to challenge the existing organizational structures and people strategies that are outdated in a socially connected world and ask HR leaders to display visionary leadership and lead their organizations in the social era. The way we work is being altered at the foundations and there never has been a more critical time than now where the role of HR is so central to an organization's success A robust people strategy will be at the core of any successful organization in the social era and likewise, the lack of one will mean rapid decay and destruction of the organization itself. Such is the power of this transformation. T way work gets done in companies thriving in the social era like Facebook, Twitter, Zynga, LinkedIn etc. is vastly different from the ones that cling on to the belief that 'bigger is better'. Organizations that have embraced 'social by design' have created disproportionate impact and disruptive innovation in the industries they operate upending existing business and business models. They have got there by their unique cultures which interestingly has a few commonalities busting bureaucracy, redefining what managers need to do, POD based organization structures, obsessing on hiring the very best, retooling all aspects of their people strategy and encouraging dialogue and feedback from their employees, customers and stakeholders. These companies consider the entire ecosystem as being equally important and have realised that in the social era, their ability to move fast and out-innovate while constantly listening to their stakeholder networks offer them a chance at being different and adapt at making quick changes for the better .

Your own organization may be using enterprise social network like Chatter (Salesforce), Jive or Yammer. Every CEO wants to know how to deal with Social that is invading every part of their organization, buzzwords like co-creating, sharing, collaboration, crowd-sourcing are everywhere. Whether you are at the top of the management chain, or have just started your career in Human Resources, you are expected to lead this discussion — Social is about 'People'. Many of today's organizations structures are largely based on a command-andcontrol model of management, and it is getting completely outdated in a socially connected world. Structures that support a top-down communication approach and rely on formal structures to get work done totally devalue the power of a social enterprise. Until recently many HR leaders have been slow to adopt some form of social networking in their enterprises. We commonly hear excuses from HR like 'this is just a marketing phenomenon impacting the Internet generation of consumers, it has nothing to do with organizations or the way we build products or services, or manager or lead people' One can wish this goes away, but this change is here to stay. We are living in a world that is witnessing the largest increase in expressive capabilities and we need to harness the messages in each of these expressions and apply it to differentiate our organization, our products and our people. There is no other time more critical for the role of HR than now — with the recent transformation from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy to an innovation economy. Your employees, managers, leaders, CEO and even the board expect you to show that you fully grasp the enormity of this, and are bold and courageous to charter your organization into the social networking reality ? So where do you begin? Let's start with defining what a Social Enterprise is. A Forrester research analyst defined it as ""business that connects employees to each other and to customers, through the power of social technologies,"" or as Salesforce (in its website) puts it ""Your brand is the sum of all conversations""? What is clear is that conversations that happened in private or around the water cooler, or between employees, or between customers, or between teams are all happening in one big heap and in real time and on social networks that are everywhere. These networks have the potential to significantly improve the quality and speed of communication bringing along with it, opinions, ideas, innovations, expression. Social networks provide native support for groups and conversations and binding these conversations using technology will help assess the value of the dialogues that are taking place. Once you have committed yourself to a social platform, you will see that there is very little training or nudging you will need to do to get used to. Man has been inherently social from the beginning and the platform is just an extension of something that comes easily. In other words, there is no steep learning curve you will need to be worried about. Your first step starts with a commitment to embracing social technologies and your role as an HR leader is to uncover how to transform your organization into a social enterprise. 3_NHRD Apr12_01 Article 1-12.p65 4/30/2012, 10:00 AM 47 48 April | 2012 NHRD Network Journal Work structures and not just organization structures Successful companies organize around talent and not capital. In the social era, management innovation and not management are the main drivers in a connected world. While we continue to evolve our organization structures to match our strategies, there is a parallel process that is brewing owing to social technologies. How work gets done is not just impacted by structure hierarchies, it is impacted by how teams are organized and how they connect with each other. For example, at Facebook, the mantra is 'Done is better than perfect' — what this means is that work gets done in very short cycles and by constantly iterating the work product, based on the feedback from stakeholder networks of users, employees, bloggers etc., you create a massive differentiator which in this case is speed. Very often, companies spend an inordinate time defining their organization structure but fail to focus on underlying socially designed work structures. Social technologies can dramatically impact speed and quality of how teams operate. They can rapidly incorporate feedback from customer social networks and create a process of iteration and continuous improvement based on feedback from a network of experts. Contrast this with the model of how work gets done today in your organization and you will see the massive opportunity in front of you. An efficient org structure is not about tweaking a layer here, adding a new role there etc. but it is whether your org structure has an ability to create a large market differentiation over competition. ""Creating pods and making them social"" New work structures in the social era call for new thinking about collaboration and sharing within your organization. The concept of a 'pod' is fast gaining acceptance over much narrowly defined 'departments and functions'. Pods are self-managed teams that work with very little formal reporting structures. These teams have individuals that reside in different functions but collaborate on common goals. They are different from project teams because there are no project hierarchies and they do not disband after a project goal is completed. The critical element is how we create these Pods, it's very important that the dependencies that exist across teams are identified and the Pod is built around that. Pods have the capacity to unlock hidden value in your organization. They bust bureaucracy and create a joint sense of ownership and purpose. Pods lend themselves to be social and diverse and challenge existing ways of doing work. As an HR leader, this is more about your courage and vision in changing the way work gets done and challenging existing dogmas and silos that have artificially been built in the pre-social-enterprise era which valued kingdom building over efficient work structures. Simply put, you need to Challenge, Disturb and Redefine work in the social era Having the right set of leaders: The doer leader To take advantage of these new social platforms, redefining how work gets done in your organization is a first step. Equally important is to rethink the role of your managers. In the social era, the role of the manager has changed dramatically. Firstly, the command-and-control approach that is far too ubiquitous is outdated and does not lend itself to enabling stakeholder networks. 3_NHRD Apr12_01 Article 1-12.p65 4/30/2012, 10:00 AM 48 April | 2012 NHRD Network Journal 49 A manager's role in the social era is to inspire and enable.

This shift recognises that the engine of productivity in a knowledge economy innovation and creativity resides in the energy and ideas of the people doing the work, collaborating across boundaries, drawing on new t",,2012.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,1291,134442141,Madan Nagaldinne,2150905456,S.

1293,A Systematic Literature Review of Sexual Harassment Studies with Text Mining,"Sexual harassment has been the topic of thousands of research articles in the 20th and 21st centuries. Several review papers have been developed to synthesize the literature about sexual harassment. While traditional literature review studies provide valuable insights, these studies have some limitations including analyzing a limited number of papers, being time-consuming and labor-intensive, focusing on a few topics, and lacking temporal trend analysis. To address these limitations, this paper employs both computational and qualitative approaches to identify major research topics, explore temporal trends of sexual harassment topics over the past few decades, and point to future possible directions in sexual harassment studies. We collected 5320 research papers published between 1977 and 2020, identified and analyzed sexual harassment topics, and explored the temporal trend of topics. Our findings indicate that sexual harassment in the workplace was the most popular research theme, and sexual harassment was investigated in a wide range of spaces ranging from school to military settings.

1294,Inside The Gay Homosociality: Skrip Seksual Dan Dominasi Maskulinitas Dalam Ruang Lingkup Pertemanan Antarsesama Gay,"Three categories of identity among gays, namely top, bottom, and versatile embodied in the different roles in sexual activity, were also motivated by differences in characteristics and specific friendship patterns in daily life. Until now, discrimination in heterosexual social relations is still experiencing by most homosexuals has triggered the formation of gay homosociality. Besides, proving self-existence, the friendship between gays is also a way to get social support and entertainment from the pressure of heterosexual friendship routines. The subjects involved in the study included eight people with different gay sexual identities, consisting of 4 bottoms, 2 tops, and 2 versatiles. The diversity of the subject identity attempts to understand the influence of sexual scripts in regulating gay homosociality patterns and is used as guidelines for behaving gays in everyday life. The dominance of masculinities in gay homosociality influences the gender gay norms in daily performativity.

1299,What Makes Things Funny? An Integrative Review of the Antecedents of Laughter and Amusement,"Despite the broad importance of humor, psychologists do not agree on the basic elements that cause people to experience laughter, amusement, and the perception that something is funny. There are more than 20 distinct psychological theories that propose appraisals that characterize humor appreciation. Most of these theories leverage a subset of five potential antecedents of humor appreciation: surprise, simultaneity, superiority, a violation appraisal, and conditions that facilitate a benign appraisal. We evaluate each antecedent against the existing empirical evidence and find that simultaneity, violation, and benign appraisals all help distinguish humorous from nonhumorous experiences, but surprise and superiority do not. Our review helps organize a disconnected literature, dispel popular but inaccurate ideas, offers a framework for future research, and helps answer three long-standing questions about humor: what conditions predict laughter and amusement, what are the adaptive benefits of humor, and why do different people think vastly different things are humorous?",Personality and Social Psychology Review,2020.0,280,15,0,False,"This review helps organize a disconnected literature, dispel popular but inaccurate ideas, offers a framework for future research, and helps answer three long-standing questions about humor: what conditions predict laughter and amusement, what are the adaptive benefits of humor, and why do different people think vastly different things are humorous.",,,,,1299,51019659,Caleb Warren,16297794,A.

1300,"Increasing the cost of female representation? The gendered effects of harassment, abuse and intimidation towards Parliamentary candidates in the UK","ABSTRACT Recently, the issue of harassment and intimidation of women in politics in long-established democracies has become a source of concern. Current research emphasizes that while women may be more frequently attacked, not all incidents of abuse against women in politics are of a gendered nature. This finding prompts further questions such as are women more frequently targeted because they are women and does such targeting inhibit women from fully participating in political campaigning? Using data from the Representative Audit of Britain’s survey of candidates contesting the 2019 General Election, this study shows that harassment has a negative electoral effect for women, even while controlling for the visibility of the candidate. This article argues that the harassment of women candidates in the UK is gendered, both in its motives and outcomes as it forces women to modify their campaign activities in ways that diminish their chances of gaining office. Our findings contribute to the theoretical and empirical understanding of violence towards women in politics and gendered political violence.","Journal of Elections, Public Opinion, and Parties",2021.0,65,2,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'tandfonline.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17457289.2021.1968413'}]","S Collignon, W Rüdig - Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and …, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'S Collignon', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NdSbxYAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=NdSbxYAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'NdSbxYAAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'W Rüdig', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NzLXICAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=NzLXICAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'NzLXICAAAAAJ'}]",1300,114755919,S.

The papers included here question and explore the often contradictory processes through which global equity-seeking populations negotiate pleasure and danger across multiple arenas (including HIV and AIDS, LGBTQ+ health and rights, intersex rights, sex worker rights, realities of refugee and displaced persons, and gender-based violence) and in diverse geographic contexts (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Canada, Ghana, Haiti, Kenya, Mauritania, Nigeria, Peru, Rwanda, and the USA). These papers examine emerging questions about the gaps and limits in current legal structures that do not legitimize sexual rights as fundamental human rights, the role of agency (and of bounded agency) needed to navigate constrained contexts, ways in which community-based solidarity efforts shape access to sexual rights, and how sexual pleasure and consent are experienced and negotiated in rights-constrained contexts.

1302,Lifetime Prevalence and Sociodemographic Correlates of Multifactorial Discrimination Among Middle-Aged and Older Adult Men Who Have Sex with Men,"ABSTRACT This study describes multifactorial discrimination (discrimination attributed to multiple social identities) among middle-aged and older adult MSM. MSM aged 40+ years (N = 1,193) enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study completed behavioral surveys ascertaining experiences of discrimination and their social identity attributions. Non-proportional odds regressions assessed multifactorial discrimination by age, race/ethnicity, HIV status, and covariates. Twenty-seven percent of participants reported multifactorial discrimination. Adjusted models indicated that middle-aged men were more likely to report multifactorial discrimination compared to older adult men. Racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to report multifactorial discrimination compared to non-Hispanic white participants. These same patterns emerged among the sub-sample of participants living with HIV. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of multifactorial discrimination in middle-aged and older MSM.

1304,Factors influencing acceptance of transgender athletes,"ABSTRACT This study examined factors influencing acceptance of transgender athletes in sport events. Quantitative data were gathered from 373 Japanese university student-athletes. We investigated contributions of two types of predictors. One is the context in which trans athletes are placed; the other involves survey respondents’ psychological constructs that may influence their reaction to the issue. The results show that trans men were more accepted than trans women, trans athletes with hormone treatment were considered more acceptable, and trans athletes were more accepted in unofficial sporting events for children and adults than in official national and international events. The results also revealed that for respondents with weaker athletic identity, higher degrees of belief in a just world were positively associated with attitudes of acceptance. Whereas stronger athletic identity was positively associated with acceptance for men, it was negatively associated with acceptance for women. Considering the different nuances surrounding transgender issues in Japan, our study will add cultural diversity to research literature that has mainly focused on the contexts of North America and Western Europe. HIGHLIGHTS Trans athletes are accepted more in recreational sports than in elite competitions. Hormone treatment is one of the key elements determining acceptance. Athletic women are less likely to accept trans athletes than non-athletic women. Athletes with strong just belief are not accepting of trans athletes.

1306,Vegan food geographies and the rise of Big Veganism,"Veganism is the subject of an increasingly diverse body of social scientific research, yet it remains relatively understudied in geography. Meanwhile, contemporary cultural commentaries note how veganism has gone mainstream, with critics warning of veganism’s corporate nature – expressed in the rise of what we term ‘Big Veganism’. We argue that food geographers are well placed to examine these trends. We first review vegan studies work beyond geography that examines and critiques the mainstreaming of veganism. We focus on literature that explores multiple contested modes of veganism, veganism as praxis in place and the rise of corporate veganism as useful foundations for geographers to build on, particularly in light of currently unfolding developments in vegan cultures and practice. Taking this work forward, we identify four conceptual traditions from research in food geographies – following foodways, alternative food networks and the cultural and material politics of eating – to develop a ‘vegan food geographies’ programme that aims to advance critical geographic work on veganism and the emerging implications of its contemporary mainstreaming.",Progress in Human Geography,2022.0,262,13,3,True,,,,,,1306,51167370,Alexandra E.

1307,Perceived Social Support Mediates the Negative Impact of Insecure Attachment Orientations on Internalized Homophobia in Gay Men,"ABSTRACT The mediating effect of perceived social support on the influence of insecure attachment orientations on internalized homophobia was assessed in a group of 70 Italian gay men (mean age = 28.8, SD = 6.2, range: 19–46 years). Participants completed self-report measures of adult attachment (Experiences in Close Relationships—Revised), perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), and internalized homophobia (Measure of Internalized Sexual Stigma for Lesbians and Gay). Higher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance, and perceptions of lower social support were correlated with higher levels of internalized homophobia. The mediation analyses showed that only attachment anxiety, but not avoidance, may have a direct link with internalized homophobia, while both anxiety and avoidance may have an indirect influence on internalized homophobia mediated by perceived social support. Improving social support can reduce the negative effects of homophobia on gay men, thus mitigating the detrimental fallout of any insecure attachment orientations.",Journal of Homosexuality,2020.0,114,9,0,False,"Improving social support can reduce the negative effects of homophobia on gay men, thus mitigating the detrimental fallout of any insecure attachment orientations, as shown in the mediation analyses.",,,,,1307,115369009,V.

 This article reports the findings of a qualitative study of first instance New Zealand employment tribunal decisions concerned with employee dismissal for social media misconduct. There are two main findings. The first relates to the legal approach to employee dismissal for social media misconduct developing in New Zealand. The decisions show New Zealand decision-makers are following the approach in other jurisdictions of treating social media misconduct dismissals as involving a balance between public and private considerations of employment conduct and calculating harm in the employment relationship. However, the decisions do not only track the emerging legal approach to social media misconduct in employment. The decisions are also a record of how social media is affecting employment relations within New Zealand. They are not only legal but also social records. The second finding relates to what the decisions reveal about employment and social media in New Zealand. The sample showed something different from other similar studies. In New Zealand, there was a large cluster of decisions where social media facilitated gender-based harassment. This finding resonates with wider research into New Zealand workplaces that suggests an enduring toxic culture where gender-based harassment is normalized.",International Journal of Law and Information Technology,2021.0,0,1,0,False,,,,,,1309,2133977917,Sophie Sia,2006974423,René Cornish,8042909,Kieran Tranter,,,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle
1310,Children’s exposure to vehicular air pollution in the United States: environmental injustices at the intersection of race/ethnicity and language,"ABSTRACT Children’s exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from vehicular sources negatively affects their development and health. Using an intersectional approach, we examined differences in exposure based on race/ethnicity and language used at children’s homes. We linked 2014 HAP data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Air Toxics Assessment with children’s sociodemographic data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–2011. We analyzed residential exposures for 13,150 US third-grade children (2013–2014) using generalized estimating equations. Results show that Hispanic and Black children faced disproportionately high exposures to vehicular HAPs as compared to White children, and children from non-English-speaking homes (regardless of race/ethnicity) experienced disproportionate exposure when compared to children from English-speaking homes. Among children who did not speak English at home, Black children were significantly more exposed than White children. White, Asian, and Hispanic children from non-English speaking homes faced disproportionate exposures when compared to their counterparts from English-speaking homes; we did not find the same for Black children. Our intersectional approach illuminates how children’s multiple identities shaped their differential exposure to vehicular air pollution, and illustrates the importance of considering within-group inequalities and English-language usage when examining distributional environmental injustices.",,2021.0,59,6,0,False,,,,,,1310,2073846446,Ricardo Rubio,5378850,Sara E.

Students completed self-report measures: 22% of TGNC adolescents reported being forced to take part in sexual activity, and 33% reported being sexually harassed. Tests of the individual parameters revealed four variables that differentiated between those who reported sexual victimisation and those who did not. Results indicated that sexual harassment victimisation, bias-based peer victimisation, problematic drug use, and female sex assigned at birth predicted sexual victimisation. Suicidal ideation was predicted by sexual victimisation, sexual harassment victimisation, bias-based peer victimisation, and problematic drug use. Greater parental support and school belonging were associated with less suicidal ideation. Practitioners, teachers, and school administrators should be sure to intervene in instances of transphobic victimisation and sexual harassment that occur in their classrooms and schools in order to address adverse outcomes for TGNC adolescents.",,2019.0,106,1,0,False,,,,"RA Marx, T Hatchel, CB Mehring… - Psychology & …, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'RA Marx', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hd8xBG8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Hd8xBG8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Hd8xBG8AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'T Hatchel', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ai6CUNQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Ai6CUNQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Ai6CUNQAAAAJ'}]",1311,39872355,Robert A.

1312,Socially Assigned Gender Nonconformity and School Violence Experience Among Transgender and Cisgender Adolescents,"Although literature documents the experiences of socially assigned gender nonconformity (SAGNC) by minority sexual orientation (i.e., lesbian, gay, and bisexual [LGB]), examination of the role of gender expression on school violence outcomes in the presence of sexual orientation and gender identity is not well understood. This study describes SAGNC among a representative sample of adolescents, accounting for sexual orientation and gender identity (e.g., transgender). A secondary data analysis was conducted using Youth Risk Behavior Survey data from Los Angeles Unified School District high schools in 2013 (N = 1,496). The prevalence of school violence by self-reported SAGNC and gender identity was obtained. Associations between SAGNC and school violence were examined using multivariate logistic regression adjusted for mischievous response bias. Two hundred ninety-one (19.5%) adolescents reported SAGNC. Having missed school due to a safety concern and being bullied in the past year were more common among socially assigned gender nonconforming adolescents than those who conformed to gender expression expectations. Socially assigned gender nonconforming adolescents, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, are at greater risk of missed school due to safety concerns, and bullying, as compared with those who conform to norms of gender expression. Future research should measure SAGNC, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression with larger representative samples of school populations across contexts (urban and rural), and inclusive of structural factors (e.g., school climate) to guide the development of prevention efforts.",Journal of Interpersonal Violence,2019.0,70,13,0,False,"S Socially assigned gender nonconforming adolescents, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, are at greater risk of missed school due to safety concerns, and bullying, as compared with those who conform to norms of gender expression.",,,,,1312,38802790,C.

1313,African American Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence: Lived Experience and Future Directions for Research,"ABSTRACT Research indicates that African American women experience especially high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV). Unique contributing factors, such as experiences of racism, compound the experience of IPV for African American women. This complex web of victimization is associated with a host of significant mental and physical health consequences, social and economic consequences, and increased engagement in high-risk behaviors for these women. African American women’s help-seeking efforts are hindered by a diverse set of circumstances. In addition, the picture of the African American community has changed significantly in recent decades. The growing diversity of the “African American” community in the U.S. implores us to enhance our understanding of the unique sub-populations of Black women in America (African Americans, African immigrants and refugees, African Caribbean immigrants, African American lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women) to better meet their needs, and ultimately reduce IPV within the African American community. Despite over two decades of growth in the research and literature on IPV in the African American community, many sub-populations remain neglected. This paper aims to present a brief overview of the current state of the literature regarding the experience of IPV for African American female survivors and identify areas for further research.","Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma",2019.0,128,10,3,False,,,,,,1313,13439425,Tameka L.

The association between psychosexual (sexual assertiveness, erotophilia, and attitude towards sexual fantasies) and sexual function (sexual desire, sexual excitation, erection, orgasm capacity, and sexual satisfaction), and the experience of physical and non-physical IPV was assessed. Methods: Data from 3394 (1766 women, 1628 men) heterosexual adults completed the Spanish version of the Index of Spouse Abuse, scales measuring psychosexual and sexual function, and demographic characteristics were collected.

1317,A novel particle swarm optimization-based grey model for the prediction of warehouse performance,"
 Warehouses constitute a key component of supply chain networks. An improvement to the operational efficiency and the productivity of warehouses is crucial for supply chain practitioners and industrial managers. Overall warehouse efficiency largely depends on synergic performance. The managers preemptively estimate the overall warehouse performance (OWP), which requires an accurate prediction of a warehouse’s key performance indicators (KPIs). This research aims to predict the KPIs of a ready-made garment (RMG) warehouse in Bangladesh with a low forecasting error in order to precisely measure OWP. Incorporating advice from experts, conducting a literature review, and accepting the limitations of data availability, this study identifies 13 KPIs. The traditional grey method (GM)—the GM (1, 1) model—is established to estimate the grey data with limited historical information but not absolute. To reduce the limitations of GM (1, 1), this paper introduces a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based grey model—PSOGM (1, 1)—to predict the warehouse’s KPIs with less forecasting error. This study also uses the genetic algorithm (GA)-based grey model—GAGM (1, 1)—the discrete grey model—DGM (1, 1)—to assess the performance of the proposed model in terms of the mean absolute percentage error and other assessment metrics. The proposed model outperforms the existing grey models in projecting OWP through the forecasting of KPIs over a 5-month period. To find out the optimal parameters of the PSO and GA algorithms before combining them with the grey model, this study adopts the Taguchi design method. Finally, this study aims to help warehouse professionals make quick OWP estimations in advance to take control measures regarding warehouse productivity and efficiency.",Journal of Computational Design and Engineering,2021.0,116,31,0,False,"A novel particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based grey model—PSOGM (1, 1)—to predict the warehouse’s KPIs with less forecasting error is introduced to help warehouse professionals make quick OWP estimations in advance to take control measures regarding warehouse productivity and efficiency.",,,,,1317,2110071101,M.

1320,"WHAT’S ‘UP NEXT’? INVESTIGATING ALGORITHMIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON YOUTUBE
 ACROSS ISSUES AND OVER TIME","YouTube’s ‘up next’ feature algorithmically suggests videos to watch
 after a video that is currently playing. This feature has been criticised for limiting
 users’ exposure to diverse media content and information sources; meanwhile, YouTube has
 reported that they have implemented technical and policy changes to address these concerns.
 Yet, there is limited data to support either the existing concerns or YouTube’s claims.
 Drawing on the concept of platform observability, this paper combines computational and
 qualitative methods to investigate the types of content YouTube’s ‘up next’ feature
 amplifies over time, using three search terms associated with sociocultural issues where
 concerns have been raised about YouTube’s role: ‘coronavirus’, ‘feminism’ and ‘beauty’. Over
 six weeks, we collected the videos (and their metadata) that were highly ranked in the
 search results for each keyword, as well as the top-ranked recommendations associated with
 each video, repeating the exercise for three steps in the recommendation chain. We then
 examined patterns in the recommended videos (and channels) for each query and their
 variation over time. We found evidence of YouTube's stated efforts to boost ‘authoritative’
 media outlets, but at the same time, misleading and controversial content continues to be
 recommended. We also found that while algorithmic recommendations offer diversity in videos
 over time, there are clear ‘winners’ at the channel level that are given a visibility boost
 in YouTube’s 'up next' feature. These impacts were attenuated differently depending on the

1325,AN INTEGRATED EXISTENTIAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRAUMA THEORY,"In this paper, an integrated existential framework for trauma theory is presented. The framework is based on the clustering of current trauma theories into physical, relational, and intrapersonal categories, and the relation of these three clusters to Irvine Yalom’s ultimate existential concerns of life/death, connection/isolation, and freedom/responsibility. Recent research has revealed an interplay between the physiological and psychosocial aspects of traumatic experiences, suggesting that a theoretical integration which includes consideration of physiological change, fear conditioning, and relational impacts is required to fully address the impacts of trauma. The fourth existential concern, meaning/meaninglessness, is argued to underlie all of the aspects of trauma, forming a common connection between all theories. This paper undertakes a brief review of current theories in traumatology to illustrate the validity of the three theoretical clusters, explores the current application of existential theory to the conceptualization of trauma, and presents a unifying organizational framework for trauma theory based in existentialism. Critiques of theory integration and existentialism are explored, followed by an analysis of risks for existential theory in the application of this framework. Implications for future research and social work practice based on the existential framework are also presented.",,2020.0,51,0,0,False,,,,,,1325,92751773,K. Wilmshurst,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,Review
1326,“They are not satisfied until they see our blood”: Syndemic HIV risks for trans women in urban Haiti,"Abstract The contribution of gender identity, neighborhood characteristics, contextual norms, and socio-political factors to the biopsychosocial health of non-heteronormative persons in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is understudied. Using syndemic theory, we conducted two focus groups (FGs) of 16 non-heteronormative individuals in Haiti's urban Cité Soleil neighborhood. Eight individuals participated in each FG. ATLAS.ti facilitated thematic content analysis of transcripts. Results indicate that disparity conditions in Cité Soleil (extreme poverty, gang violence, easy access of weapons by criminals, lack of law enforcement, and a 3.6% Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV] rate) facilitate a syndemic of substance abuse and non-partner sexual violence. These interact adversely with gender expression, transphobia, transmisogyny, cissexism, lack of confidential HIV testing, and hostilities from religious groups to increase participants' risks of coercive non-partner sexual violence by groups of inebriated men. Injuries from sexual violence, limited access to confidential HIV testing, and inaccurate HIV knowledge heighten HIV risk and anxiety. Haiti’s negative human rights record, 2.2% HIV prevalence, and cultural norms that devalue women are syndemic pathways that perpetuate or worsen disparity conditions and health risks, particularly for trans women. It is a moral, ethical, public health, and social justice mandate to address HIV prevention and mental health promotion for Haitian trans women.",International Journal of Mental Health,2021.0,74,1,0,False,,,,"M Joshi, G J.

1327,Bioactive-metal-containing zeolites,"The industrial, agricultural, environmental, sanitary and medical use of zeolites (MenSixAlnO2(n+x) .mH2O, Me = Na, K, … ½Ca, ½Mg, …) is due to the complex of their properties, among which an important place is occupied by the ability of zeolites to enter into ion exchange reactions with the participation of Me+n ions compensating the negative charge of the crystal lattice constructed from SiO4 and AlO4 – tetrahedra. Utilization of the natural zeolites for detoxification of living organisms and in water treatment has increasing interest due to their availability and low cost. At first, most of the studies in this area were concentrated on the use of clinoptilolite in the removal of heavy metals. On the other hand, started at the beginning of the 21st century and continuing to this day, studies showed that natural and synthetic zeolites exchanged by ions of silver, copper, zinc or some other transition metals exhibit antimicrobial activity toward a broad range of microorganisms. It is believed that the porous zeolite structure enables metal cations to move freely from the lattice to the environment, and this seems to be responsible for their activity toward microorganisms, but it has recently been established that in some cases the antibacterial activity could be attributed to the bioactive-metalcontaining zeolite (BMZ) itself. BMZ formulations can be combined with various materials used in manufacturing medical devices, surfaces, textiles, or household items where antimicrobial properties are required. Other problem that can be solved by application of BMZs is possible microbiological contamination of zeolite sorbents used in the remediation of hazardous heavy metal-polluted soils or in the purification of industrial wastewater; in such cases it is necessary to provide the sorption materials with bacteriostatic properties in order to prevent the growth of microorganisms on their surface. This talk will discuss a possibilities of obtaining BMZs with a high content of target bioactive metals on the basis of various natural, synthetic and modified zeolites, the structure and properties of different BMZs, as well as possible causes of the bactericidal activity of BMZs at low levels of metal removal from them.",,2020.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,1327,1672383164,T.

1328,Trolls Without Borders: A Cross-Cultural Examination of Victim Reactions to Verbal and Silent Aggression Online,"Trolling—the online exploitation of website, chat, or game mechanics at another user's expense—can and does take place all over cyberspace. It can take myriad forms, as well—some verbal, like trash-talking an opponent in a game, and some silent, like refusing to include a new player in a team effort during an in-game quest. However, despite this variety, there are few to no studies comparing the effects of these differing trolling types on victims. In addition, no study has yet taken into account users' offline cultural context and norms into the trolling victim experience. To fill this gap in the literature, the present study put participants from three culturally-distinct countries—Pakistan, Taiwan, and the Netherlands—in a simulated trolling interaction using the Cyberball game. Participants were either flamed (read: harshly insulted) or ostracized by a member of their own cultural group (ingroup) or a minority member (outgroup), and the participants' emotional responses, behavioral intentions toward the other players, and messages sent during the game were taken as indicators of their response to the trolling. Results showed that our Taiwanese sample used the most reactive aggression when trolled and our Dutch sample was the most passive. In addition, ostracism generally produced the desire to repair relationships, irrespective of cultural context, and perpetrator culture (ingroup or outgroup) only produced an effect in the behavioral intentions of our Pakistani sample. Overall, it would appear that online and offline culture interact to produce the variety of responses to trolling seen in extant literature.

The article discusses a range of factors to consider at each stage of the research process as researchers seek to be inclusive, responsive to diversity concerns, and seek equity. The researcher’s perspective and positionality are discussed and the importance of critical self-examination of one’s position in relation to the research is emphasized.

Using our interviews with third sector practitioners providing mental health support to a wealth of migrant populations in London, the paper offers key examples of how TSOs (Third Sector Organisations) address migrant women’s diverse needs, showing how diversity is practised in the everyday of community groups. This paper’s novelty consists in exposing overlaps and divergences between diversity discourses and diversity practices and its added value lays in the combination of academic and practitioner perspectives in the study of TSOs supporting migrant, refugee and asylum seeker women in London.",,2020.0,53,2,0,False,,,,,,1331,16314647,E.

1332,EFFECTS OF TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT (TQM) ON FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: EVIDENCE FROM HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SECTOR OF PAKISTAN,"Purpose: This research explores the causal linkage between TQM and financial performance or non-financial performance within the higher education sector of Pakistan. In this regard, the link between each element of total quality management, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, was explored and empirically analyzed concerning financial and non-financial performance. 
Methodology: The regression and correlation statistical measures, using SPSS version 20.0, were used to study the linkage of TQM with financial and non-financial performance. The study utilized a quantitative research approach for data collection purposes, and data was gathered from 220 employees of well-established higher educational institutes of Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the help of a directly administered survey approach. 
Results: The results support the causal linkage between TQM and financial or non-financial performance. The findings indicate that TQM has a significant positive link with the financial and non-financial performance of service organizations within the higher education sector of Pakistan. 
Applications of this study: The higher education industry is the backbone of every nation, especially the developing countries. The higher education sector of developing countries, such as Pakistan, has been facing issues of quality, and hence the implementation of TQM practices can have a considerable effect on its improvement. This study provides valued insights for higher education practitioners to revise policies for the positive growth and development of this sector. 
The Novelty of this study: The contribution of this research is the investigation of TQM practices on financial and non-financial performance of higher educational institutes of a developing nation, i.e. Pakistan, where it is relatively a new concept. It was found that TQM practices have a significant impact on financial and non-financial performance.",Humanities & Social Sciences Reviews,2021.0,44,2,0,True,,,,,,1332,2091600786,Tehmeena Shafqat,39738810,R.

1333,"The Moral Foundations of Left-Wing Authoritarianism: On the Character, Cohesion, and Clout of Tribal Equalitarian Discourse","Left-wing authoritarianism remains far less understood than right-wing authoritarianism. We contribute to the literature on the former, which typically relies on surveys, using a new social media analytics approach. We use a list of 60 terms to provide an exploratory sketch of the outlines of a political ideology (tribal equalitarianism) with origins in 19th and 20th century social philosophy. We then use analyses of the English Corpus of Google Books (over 8 million books) and scraped unique tweets from Twitter (n = 202,852) to conduct a series of investigations to discern the extent to which this ideology is cohesive amongst the public, reveals signatures of authoritarianism and has been growing in popularity. Though exploratory, our results provide some evidence of left-wing authoritarianism in two forms (1) a uniquely conservative moral signature amongst ostensible liberals using measures from Moral Foundations Theory and (2) a substantial prevalence of anger, relative to anxiety or sadness.

Although the results revealed that gender diverse students reported significantly less favorable perceptions of climate and more experience with discriminatory behaviors than did cisgender students, gender diverse students were less likely to officially report these experiences. These results have implications for university personnel developing programs promoting inclusivity and administrators looking to improve discrimination/harassment reporting procedures.",,2019.0,85,7,0,False,,,,,,1334,4617208,A.

1335,Puerto Ricans and Mexican immigrants differ in their psychological responses to patterns of lifetime adversity,"Background Puerto Ricans and Mexican immigrants are often exposed to multiple types of adversity across their lifetime (e.g., maltreatment, household dysfunction, discrimination) and this exposure can increase the risk for adult mental health problems. Purpose The objective of this study was to (a) identify subgroups of individuals exposed to unique combinations of childhood adversity and lifetime discrimination among Puerto Ricans and Mexican immigrants, and (b) compare the prevalence of mental health problems across different risk profiles. Method We used existing data from the HCHS/SOL Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Participants included Puerto Rican (N = 402) and Mexican adults (N = 1351) born outside but living in the continental U.S. Findings Through latent profile analysis, we selected a three-profile solution for Puerto Ricans: (a) Low Exposure (low on all adversity items; 58% of sample), (b) Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Only (high on ACEs items, average or lower than average on discrimination items; 32%), and (c) Dual Exposure (high on all adversity items; 10%). For Mexicans, we selected a four-profile solution: (a) Low Exposure (52%), (b) ACEs Only (24%), (c) Maltreatment and Discrimination (15%), and (d) Dual Exposure (9%). For Mexicans, we found that the Dual Exposure and the Maltreatment and Discrimination profiles had the highest levels of mental health problems. For Puerto Ricans, the Dual Exposure and ACEs Only profiles had the highest levels of mental health problems, suggesting that Puerto Ricans may be more vulnerable to the effects of childhood adversities as compared to Mexican immigrants. Results from our study indicate that different patterns of adversity exposure are linked to different levels of mental health outcomes, and therefore, may require different intervention dosage. Understanding which groups of individuals are at highest and lowest risk for mental health problems is critical for developing effective, tailored interventions to prevent the negative effects of childhood adversity and discrimination for Latinxs.",PLoS ONE,2021.0,91,1,0,True,,Html,"[{'title': 'plos.org', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258324'}]","DK Cooper, M Bámaca-Colbert, EK Layland… - PloS one, 2021 - journals.plos.org","[{'name': 'M Bámaca-Colbert', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mC2nAoEAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=mC2nAoEAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'mC2nAoEAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'EK Layland', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f0CBeRUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=f0CBeRUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'f0CBeRUAAAAJ'}]",1335,48169281,D.

Our analysis highlights the dominance of a multicultural integration discourse that connotes a particularly German understanding of multicultural diversity as only valuable when it is subordinate to an individual’s integration into German culture. Multicultural integration implicitly constructs Germanness as white through dubious claims of the “civilizational superiority” of Western/Christian secularism and a rejection of non-Western/Islamic religiosity as fundamentally “inferior” or “un-democratic.” The shifting treatment of Özil from an exemplar of multicultural integration to a symbol of its failure illustrates the underlying racialized-religious foundation of the discourse and Germany’s remaining attachments to whiteness vis-à-vis Christianity.,,2020.0,46,2,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'academia.edu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.academia.edu/download/68926489/Fischer_and_Mohrman_Multicultural_Integration_in_Germany.pdf'}]","M Fischer, K Mohrman - Journal of International and Intercultural …, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'M Fischer', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C88i12YAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=C88i12YAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'C88i12YAAAAJ'}]",1336,51043083,Mia Fischer,112880329,K.

We assessed the prevalence, correlates, and 10-year time-trends of unwanted sex due to intoxication among a representative sample of 4,279 women and 3,875 men aged 16–69 years in Australia and considered how these vary by gender. In 2012–13, 16% of women and 10% of men reported ever having had a sexual experience when they “did not want to because they were too drunk or high at the time.” For both women and men, this was associated with younger age, bisexual activity, and reports of lifetime injection drug use, sexually transmitted infections, and forced sex. Among women only, it was associated with drinking above guideline levels and ever having terminated a pregnancy. Among men only, it was associated with current tobacco smoking, elevated psychosocial distress, and poor general health. Compared with 2001–02 data, fewer men reported unwanted intoxicated sex, while there were no changes for women as a whole. Interpreting these findings through an intersectional assemblage framework supports stronger understanding of the multiple factors influencing sexuality and substance use with implications for promoting equity, safety, and sexual health.",Journal of Sex Research,2020.0,108,2,0,True,"Prevalence, correlates, and 10-year time-trends of unwanted sex due to intoxication among a representative sample of 4,279 women and 3,875 men aged 16–69 years in Australia are assessed and how these vary by gender are considered.",,,,,1338,47219844,A.

1343,"Crushed by COVID-19 Medical Bills, Coronavirus Victims Need Debt Relief Under the Bankruptcy Code and Workers’ Compensation Laws","After the U.S. declared COVID-19 a pandemic, cracks in the U.S.’s fragile privatized healthcare system were exposed. At the start of the pandemic, 74 million U.S. residents were already uninsured or underinsured. To date, over 7.7 million recently terminated employees have lost their employer-provided health insurance, while over 24.6 million individuals have been infected with COVID-19 and 800,000 have been hospitalized. As a result, coronavirus survival often comes with astronomical medical bills like the $1.1 million hospital bill received by Michael Flor, a 70-year-old survivor who spent 62 days in the hospital for treatment.This Article examines how the U.S.’s flawed healthcare system and federal bankruptcy law may work together to unfairly penalize debtors burdened with medical debts arising from treatment for an infectious disease, like COVID-19. The financial fate of many burdened with infectious-disease medical bills will depend on whether a court characterizes such bills as “consumer” debts. Under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, individuals with “primarily consumer debts” are subject to a complex calculation known as the “Means Test.” Debtors who have their massive medical bills characterized as non-consumer debts are allowed to wipe out those bills quickly in a Chapter 7 case. Debtors who have such bills characterized as consumer debts and who fail the Means Test are forced into a five-year repayment plan in a Chapter 13 case, where they pay down their unsecured debts, including medical bills. As a result, courts are effectively penalizing debtors who lack adequate health insurance and who involuntarily contract a contagious disease.To prevent such perverse results, this Article proposes that bankruptcy law be amended to exclude infectious-disease medical bills from the definition of consumer debt. Also, to obviate the need for some individuals to file for bankruptcy relief, this Article proposes that workers’ compensation (“workers’ comp”) laws be amended to include COVID-19 as an occupational disease for any “essential worker,” as defined in each state, so that infected essential workers can have their medical bills paid from workers’ comp funds. If a former U.S. president infected with COVID-19 was considered essential for the nation’s survival and, therefore, entitled to taxpayer-funded medical care in state-of-the-art facilities, then front-line employees—who are required to work for the benefit and survival of us all—should absolutely receive COVID-19 treatment at no cost to them. Legislative action is especially needed due to the current spread of new, highly contagious mutations of COVID-19 in the U.S. With the proposed legislative amendments in place, the U.S. would ensure that survivors are protected from financial devastation due to involuntarily contracting an infectious disease.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2021.0,0,0,0,False,"To prevent perverse results, this Article proposes that bankruptcy law be amended to exclude infectious-disease medical bills from the definition of consumer debt, and workers’ compensation laws are amended to include COVID-19 as an occupational disease for any “essential worker,” as defined in each state.",,,,,1343,118443670,Creola Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,

A multi-task learning framework is adopted to jointly learn to extract keywords and generate a summary for the input sentence. We apply keywords-guided selective encoding strategies to filter source information by investigating the interactions between the input sentence and the keywords. We extend pointer-generator network by a dual-attention and a dual-copy mechanism, which can integrate the semantics of the input sentence and the keywords, and copy words from both the input sentence and the keywords.

We conceptualise this as market violence and locate one group of people largely missing from this conversation: women. To theorise women’s structural subordination in the marketplace we introduce several key tenets of radical feminist theory. Then, applying the continuum of sexual violence, we conceive markets as structures of sexual violence. Through the online pornography market, we find the market system (in producing and distributing women as commodities) is perpetrating a complex range of (often difficult to define) forms of sexual violence. We then reveal the market’s pervasiveness as a form of sexual harassment.

1349,Detailing Racialized and Gendered Mechanisms of Undergraduate Precalculus and Calculus Classroom Instruction,"Abstract Undergraduate mathematics education can be experienced in discouraging and marginalizing ways among Black students, Latin* students, and white women. Precalculus and calculus courses, in particular, operate as gatekeepers that contribute to racialized and gendered attrition in persistence with mathematics coursework and pursuits in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). However, student perceptions of instruction in these introductory mathematics courses have yet to be systematically examined as a contributor to such attrition. This paper presents findings from a study of 20 historically marginalized students’ perceptions of precalculus and calculus instruction to document features that they found discouraging and marginalizing. Our analysis revealed how students across different race-gender identities reported stereotyping as well as issues of representation in introductory mathematics classrooms and STEM fields as shaping their perceptions of instruction. These perceptions pointed to the operation of three racialized and gendered mechanisms in instruction: (i) creating differential opportunities for participation and support, (ii) limiting support from same-race, same-gender peers to manage negativity in instruction, and (iii) activating exclusionary ideas about who belongs in STEM fields. We draw on our findings to raise implications for research and practice in undergraduate mathematics education.",,2020.0,43,20,0,False,,,,,,1349,7712533,Luis A.

1351,Towards an Archive of the Future: Reconstructing Ireland's Lost History through the Beyond 2022 Project,"In 1922, the 'Record Treasury' of the Public Record Office of Ireland in Dublin was destroyed in the opening engagement of Ireland's Civil War. The Treasury contained millions of historical documents filling 100,000 square feet of shelving organised into 5,500 series of records accumulated over seven centuries. It was destroyed in one afternoon. Beyond 2022 is an international collaborative research project based at the ADAPT Centre, Trinity College Dublin, and funded by the Government of Ireland. We are working to create a virtual reimagining of this lost national archive. Many millions of words from destroyed documents will be linked and reassembled from copies, transcripts and other records scattered among the collections of our archival partners. We will bring together this rich array of replacement items within an immersive 3-D reconstruction of the destroyed building. In this keynote address, we will discuss the Digital Humanities and Knowledge Engineering challenges presented by the project, and also reflect on how this reimagining of a lost archive will provide deeper search and discoverability than was possible one hundred years ago when the archive was still in existence.",ACM Conference on Hypertext & Social Media,2021.0,0,0,0,False,"The Digital Humanities and Knowledge Engineering challenges presented by the Beyond 2022 project are discussed, and how this reimagining of a lost archive will provide deeper search and discoverability than was possible one hundred years ago when the archive was still in existence is reflected.",,,,,1351,144501383,Peter Crooks,1989223,Gary Munnelly,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,"JournalArticle, Book"

1353,Traumatic loss and productive impasse in comics: visual metaphors of depression and melancholia in Jillian and Mariko Tamaki’s This One Summer,"ABSTRACT In this paper, I explore how Jillian and Mariko Tamaki, in This One Summer, employ a variety of images and visual metaphors to address the emotional situations of traumatic loss. In this graphic novel, we encounter a character named Alice, who is often distracted and withdrawn, and appears to suffer from a prolonged, inescapable period of depression and sadness. By the graphic novel’s end, however, she begins to learn how to live with the effects of a loss that won’t let her go, as her depressive period becomes reframed as a state of productive impasse. In my discussion, I move through three major types of images that help to illuminate the inner transformations of Alice’s psychic condition: Shattering, Shifting Temporalities, and Diving. Throughout this paper, I use the conceptual touchstones of psychoanalytic theory to describe the interrelation of mourning and melancholia, and suggest that focusing closely on the visual elements of emotional events in comics might allow for an interpretation of those ephemeral aspects of human experience – including moods and feelings – whose expression inevitably requires more than words alone.",Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics,2019.0,27,0,0,False,,,,,,1353,105036987,David Lewkowich,,,,,,,,,,,Art,

1355,Humility and The Gift: The Elective Affinity of Institutions and Ethics in Orthodox Parishes,"This article analyzes the economic ethics of modern Orthodox laity belonging to the Russian Orthodox Church. The article is based on an array of interviews with priests, and Orthodox laypersons (as well as non-believers and Catholics for comparison purposes). Data were collected via several projects from 2004 to 2014. Data (in-depth interviews from the recent projects 2012−2014 amount to 395) are analyzed by means of the grounded theory methods, including substantial and theoretical coding, theoretical sampling, and constant comparative method. Theories used include the concept of elective affinity between the motivation of economic activities and types of economic organization (Weber) and the typology of economic systems by K. Polanyi. This study attempts to show the elective affinity between the ethics of humility and the principle of economic integration known as reciprocity networks of mutual support of both churched and unchurched Russians, centered in the parishes and functioning on the basis of the logic of gift giving. Such a coupling of motivation and informal economy, invisible to the GDP, performs important functions in contemporary Russia which has a mix of economic types (such as generating of social capital or development of moral density and solidarity in local communities. They in it’s turn fulfill some economic functions - i.e. avoiding getting into the debt bondage or some others).The article deals with (the activated by humility ethics) reciprocity and its consequences for the community seeks to challenge the established view on Orthodox Christianity as an ‘unproductive’ culture, hindering economic development.",,2018.0,0,1,0,True,,,,,,1355,116760392,I.

However, the generally unrestricted nature of social media can lead to problematic discussions which may perpetuate damaging stereotypes and affect responses to victims and perpetrators of certain crimes. This study analysed social media reader commentary in response to news articles reporting 30 incidents of family violence (FV) homicide, published via the Facebook pages of four Australian media organizations. The study examined the nature of the media coverage and the reader comments for each homicide, according to the victim–offender relationship and the underlying tone of the initial article. Notable differences were evident in both the nature of the media coverage and the reader comments for homicides perpetrated by male and female offenders. Differences were also evident according to the type of victim (male, female or child). Male victims received less sympathy than females, whereas male offenders elicited notably more criticism. The findings point to embedded perceptions and expectations mapped to different victim–offender relationships. While the results reflect predominant patterns of FV victim–offender relationships, they also highlight the particular challenges faced by male victims of family violence.",Journal of Gender Studies,2020.0,96,2,0,False,,,,"S Komazec, C Farmer - Journal of gender studies, 2021 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'C Farmer', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BrFyniUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=BrFyniUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'BrFyniUAAAAJ'}]",1358,1729275804,S.

Employing a phenomenological epistemology, a qualitative methodology was adopted to explore FPF. Extant literature was reviewed. Using purposive sampling, and employing an emic posture, 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior restaurant and hotel chefs until saturation occurred. Interviews were transcribed, read repeatedly, and coded using the qualitative analysis software package QDA Miner Lite. An inter-rater reliability score of .78 using Cohen’s Kappa coefficient formula reflected substantial agreement between coders. Thematic analysis was used. The study revealed three main categories of FPF types (sensory/organoleptic, safety, other) and FPF causes (People related failure; Operation-related failure; and Food supply/supplier-related failures). A conceptual model was developed from these categories underpinned by management control systems, continuous training, clear communication, and the organizational culture and climate of kitchens. Chefs found that FPF was inevitable based on human error, and can be precipitated by certain factors but reduced by other interventions. Research findings may assist in reducing its frequency, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and retention while reducing financial and environmental costs of FPF. Practical, theoretical, and managerial implications are discussed.

1361,'Walking Into a Fire Hoping You Don't Catch': Strategies and Designs to Facilitate Cross-Partisan Online Discussions,"While cross-partisan conversations are central to a vibrant deliberative democracy, these conversations are hard to have, especially amidst unprecedented levels of partisan animosity we observe today. We report on a qualitative study of 17 US residents who engage with outpartisans on Reddit to understand what they look for in these interactions, and the strategies they adopt. We find that users have multiple, sometimes contradictory expectations of these conversations, ranging from deliberative discussions to entertainment and banter. In aiming to foster 'good' cross-partisan discussions, users make strategic choices on which subreddits to participate in, who to engage with and how to talk to outpartisans, often establishing common ground, complimenting, and remaining dispassionate in their interactions. Further, contrary to offline settings where knowing more about outpartisan interlocutors help manage disagreements, on Reddit, users look to actively learn as little as possible about them for fear that such information may bias their interactions. However, through design probes, we find that users are actually open to knowing certain kinds of information about their interlocutors, such as non-political subreddits that they both participate in, and to having that information made visible to their interlocutors. However, making other information visible, such as the other subreddits that they participate in or their past comments, though potentially humanizing, raises concerns around privacy and misuse of that information for personal attacks especially among women and minority groups. Finally, we identify important challenges and opportunities in designing to improve online cross-partisan interactions in today's hyper-polarized environment.",Proc. ACM Hum. Comput.

The second section focusses on the use of visuals and nonverbal behaviour in two specific journalistic contexts: print journalism and the television news. Illustrative examples are discussed, based on the impact of photographs of the Vietnam War and the dead Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi; celebrity photographs are also considered.

1366,"Recommendations for Canada's National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence: perspectives from leaders, service providers and survivors in Canada's largest city during the COVID-19 pandemic.","INTRODUCTION
The Canadian government has committed to a national action plan (NAP) to address violence against women (VAW). However, a formalized plan for implementation has not been published. Building on existing recommendations and consultations, we conducted the first formal and peer-reviewed qualitative analysis of the perspectives of leaders, service providers and survivors on what should be considered in Canada's NAP on VAW.


METHODS
We applied thematic analysis to qualitative data from 18 staff working on VAW services (11 direct support, 7 in leadership roles) and 10 VAW survivor participants of a community-based study on VAW programming during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area (Ontario, Canada).


RESULTS
We generated 12 recommendations for Canada's NAP on VAW, which we organized into four thematic areas: (1) invest into VAW services and crisis supports (e.g. strengthen referral mechanisms to VAW programming); (2) enhance structural supports (e.g. invest in the full housing continuum for VAW survivors); (3) develop coordinated systems (e.g. strengthen collaboration between health and VAW systems); and (4) implement and evaluate primary prevention strategies (e.g. conduct a gender-based and intersectional analysis of existing social and public policies).


CONCLUSION
In this study, we developed, prioritized and nuanced recommendations for Canada's proposed NAP on VAW based on a rigorous analysis of the perspectives of VAW survivors and staff in Canada's largest city during the COVID-19 pandemic. An effective NAP will require investment in direct support organizations; equitable housing and other structural supports; strategic coordination of health, justice and social care systems; and primary prevention strategies, including gender transformative policy reform.",Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada,2023.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,1366,1820523,A.

1367,Blogging to Counter Epistemic Injustice: Trans disabled digital micro-resistance,"As part of a larger research project on the intersections between transness, disability, cisgenderism (also called transphobia), and ableism/sanism, this article presents the results of a three-month netnography of blog posts made between 2013 and 2019 by selected Tumblr and off-Tumblr blogs authored by people identifying as both trans and disabled. Mobilizing a theoretical framework that combines trans and disability/crip/Mad theory and the notion of epistemic injustice, we highlight the unique possibilities of community building, connection, identity formation, and micro-practices of resistance in trans disabled digital communities. Trans disabled bloggers counter epistemic injustice by speaking back, reclaiming space, and responding to the cisgenderist and ableist/sanist micro-aggressions they experience in their daily lives. This exploration of trans disabled bloggers' micro-activism is divided into four parts. After reviewing the literature in the emerging field of trans disability studies in the first part, the second and third parts present our theoretical and methodological frameworks. Findings are presented and discussed in the three subsections of the fourth part, which delves deeper into our typology of three interrelated genres of trans disabled blog posts: informational, testimonial, and activist. As their names suggest, these genres aim respectively to: 1) inform other trans disabled internet users of identificatory possibilities; 2) testify about bloggers' lived experiences; and 3) advocate for trans disabled people through appeals to users both within and outside trans and disabled communities.",,2021.0,0,1,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'dsq-sds.org', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://dsq-sds.org/article/download/7794/5954'}]","S Cavar, A Baril - Disability Studies Quarterly, 2021 - dsq-sds.org","[{'name': 'A Baril', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_fpdZuIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=_fpdZuIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '_fpdZuIAAAAJ'}]",1367,118445030,Sarah Cavar,37060142,Alexandre Baril,,,,,,,,,Sociology,Review

1369,Stigma Surrounding Sexually Transmitted Infections among Medical Students in Germany,"ABSTRACT Stigmatization by health care professionals leads to decreased help-seeking behaviors in those being stigmatized. Prejudicial attitudes are especially pronounced concerning sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which is crucial in light of rising prevalence rates of STIs in recent years. We aimed to examine stigmatization against patients with sexually versus non-sexually transmitted infections among medical students in Germany. We also assessed how a person’s sexual orientation or gender might contribute to stigma. Medical students (N = 332) read about a fictious patient with symptoms of pharyngitis after having had a casual sex encounter. Gender (female/male) and sexual orientation (hetero-/bi-/homosexual) of the patient as well as the pathogen causing the infection (gonococcus/H1N1-virus) were randomly varied. Afterwards, stigma against the patient was assessed. Patients with a gonococcal pharyngitis were perceived as more prone to engage in risky behavior, dumber, and less responsible than patients with a H1N1-virus pharyngitis. Bisexual patients were perceived as more prone to engage in risky behavior than hetero- and homosexual individuals. The predictability of the consequences of the patient’s actions was rated higher in bisexual patients. Stigmatizing attitudes toward patients with a STI were frequent, especially against bisexual patients. More education should be dedicated to sexual/LGB health during medical school to reduce existing stigma.",Journal of Sex Research,2020.0,91,2,0,False,"Stigmatizing attitudes toward patients with a STI were frequent, especially against bisexual patients, and more education should be dedicated to sexual/LGB health during medical school to reduce existing stigma.",,,,,1369,49641578,V.

1370,The Great Mother: A Psychoanalytical Analysis of the Magna Mater In Two Novels,"Sigmund Freud formulated the theory of “Oedipus Complex”, Erich Newmann came forth with “The Great Mother or the Magna Mater” based on Carl Jung’s Theory of the Archetype and the Mother Complex, which charts the mental processes of women’s psychological development. Two novels are analysed based on the given psychoanalytical theories the first a British novel “Sons and Lovers” by D.H. Lawrence and the other Australian “The Thorn Birds” by Colleen McCullough. Both novels have two brothers who become the focus of their mother’s attention and the overbearing mother’s control clashes with their identities, which results in death or fallout from society. The characters’ personal conflicts reveal encrypted truth. Key wordsSigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Archetype, Erich Newmann, D. H. Lawrence, Sons and Lovers, Colleen McCullough, The Thorn Birds. INTRODUCTION The first novel is a British novel Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence. The male siblings are William and Paul Morel they have a brother and a sister, they live with their mother Gertrude Morel and father Walter Morel. The other an Australian novel The Thorn Bird by Colleen McCullough. The mother is Fee ( Fiona) Cleary and the sons are Frank (Francis) Cleary and Stu (Stewart) Cleary. Each of the characters trace their affection to one parent, their mother. Though they have other siblings both male and female, they and their mothers share a special bond very different to others. The motherson relationship can be analysed based on the psychoanalytical theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Newmann, by doing so we see that the odd bond is not one sided but reciprocal. Freud’s theory interprets what the sons feel for the mother which is very different from normal sonmother affection. Newmann’s Great Mother Illustration inspired by Carl Jung’s theory about the Mother Complex and of the maternal psychological condition can be applied to the female characters to fully understand what leads the two mothers to rely so heavily upon their first born and later on the second favourite son, the reader constructs an interpretation for disparate elements. The sons of both novels develop from young adults, and have witnessed passive resistance, physical abuse, mental or verbal violence. Both the novels have been written around the same period sharing a common timeline at the start of the twentieth century, and haven’t been yet examined together by scholars Shoshana Felman describes (1995, 46) “how the situations illuminate the understanding of the testaments allowing for the readers to identify intersections between literature, autobiography, and history each tied up with the act of bearing witness”. This paper first explains both Freud’s and Newmann’s psychoanalytical theories which explain the Oedipus Complexunderstanding of the son’s psychology and the Magna Materunderstanding of the mother’s mind, the mother’s driving force based on the theory. Finally, the complex nature of the mother-son relationship is analyzed in the two stories. Psychoanalytical theory: The maternal archetype as suggested by Newmann has different aspects that manifested in different images, for example, the terrible aspect and the life-giving, ""kindly"" aspect of an Advances in Social Sciences Research Journal (ASSRJ) Vol.6, Issue 11 Nov-2019 Copyright © Society for Science and Education, United Kingdom 131 archetype appear in diverging images. But on the other hand, the terribleness of one archetype , e.g., the Terrible Mother, is expressed in other symbols than that of another archetype, e.g., the Terrible Father. According to Freud, the child gets to the phase of genital primacy around age five, at which time the Oedipus complex demonstrates itself. To put it in simple words, the Oedipus complex originates from the boy's insentient competition with his father for the affection of his mother. Freud hired the term from the Oedipus the Rex a classic play written by Sophocles in which the hero unknowingly assassinates his father and marries his mother. This competition for the love of mother is described in The Ego and the Id, as follows: .. . the boy deals with his father by identifying himself with him. For a time these two relationships [the child's devotion to his mother and identification with his father] proceed side by side, until the boy's sexual wishes in regard to his mother become more intense and his father is perceived as an obstacle to them; from this the Oedipus complex originates. His identification with his father then takes on a hostile coloring and changes into a wish to get rid of his father in order to take his place with his mother. Hence forward his relation to his father is ambivalent it seems as if the ambivalence inherent in the identification from the beginning had become manifest. An ambivalent attitude to his father and an object-relation of a solely affectionate kind to his mother make up the content of the simple positive Oedipus complex in a boy. (27-22) It can be understood that when a woman of character and refinement gets married into the lower class, because she has come down in her life has no satisfaction. Because she had a passion for her husband, children are born. But the problem arises when the sons grow up she selects them as lovers, first the eldest and then the second. These sons’ when they reach manhood cannot love because their mother’s hold is the strongest power in their lives. This was summed up by Lawrence himself in one of his letters to Edward Garnett on 12 November 1912 about Sons and Lovers. These sons are urged into life by their reciprocal love of their mother — urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives, and holds them. It's rather like Goethe and his mother and Frau von Stein and Christiana — As soon as the young men come into contact with women, there's a split. The split kills him, because he doesn't know where he is. The next son gets a woman who fights for his soul – fights his mother. The son loves his mother – all the sons hate and are jealous of the father. The battle goes on between the mother and the girl, with the son as object. The mother gradually proves stronger, because of the ties of blood. The son decides to leave his soul in his mother's hands, and, like his elder brother go for passion. He gets passion. Then the split begins to tell again. But, almost unconsciously, the mother realizes what is the matter, and begins to die. The son casts off his mistress, attends to his mother dying. He is left in the end naked of everything, with the drift towards death. Paul wins art prizes but William’s winning the sporting trophy was far more important to Mrs. Morel. The sons live through their mother and she lives through them. She feels satisfied that her sons were perfect, she had fulfilled her maternal duty well, she had brought them up single-handedly into winners and not failures like their father. With the death or absence of a sibling the other son gets a chance to fill in the void left in the mother’s heart, with William’s death Mrs. Morel moves away from all of her family even Paul, but when Paul falls ill she cares for him and he secures the special place that once belonged only to William. Whereas the other pair Frank and Stu lacked these opportunities at socializing in the outback Fee took tremendous pride at being the mother of son. Frank always felt elated after his wrestling match victories it was during one such occasion that Paddy utters the dark secret of Frank’s Warda, W. U. (2019). The Great Mother: A Psychoanalytical Analysis of the Magna Mater In Two Novels. Advances in Social Sciences Research Journal, 6(11) 130-135. 132 URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.14738/assrj.611.7305. parentage after which Frank leaves to join a wrestling troop, resulting in killing a man and him being imprisoned for life at hard labour. Frank’s running away from home brings Stu closer to his mother as he was the only one who totally took her nature both in looks and silence. Paddy had viewed Frank as a Jonas who forever had destroyed and hung like a dark shadow over his family’s complete joy, did not feel that way towards Stu as Stu lacked the violence and fierceness. The control the mother practiced over the son does not bring any benefit it is this control that leads to the downfall of her best-loved son Frank. In Thorn Birds the awareness of her grip on her son was what restrained Frank for years preventing him from leaving her. It was only when Paddy had told Frank in a fit of rage the reality of Frank’s parentage that Frank knew he could break all bonds and be gone. But his parting was not an easy one for him as he left with the burden of guilt that all the years he had felt it was Paddy who had been restraining his mother holding her down but he realized that it was him, all along. His existence and the need to give him the legitimacy that had tied her to Paddy. A man whom Frank had thought was unworthy of Fiona neither in status or virtuosity, had been responsible in giving him legitimacy and making Fee respectable in the eyes of society was too much for him to bear. The only time that the sons' physical feelings for the mother surface is when the sons refuse to believe that the mother could be anyone less than that to be revered like the virgin Mary, the sons directly ask the mother not to sleep with their father. Freud describes the child’s conflict is between the desire for union (incest) and the impossibility of union enforced by the father’s threat of castration, psychologists Abraham and Torok begin with the premise-based on the lifesituation – that the mother-child union already exists. The child’s conflict in terms of the desire to remain faithful to the mother in an obsolete state of in differentiation and the desire for detachment from the mother in a forwardin a quest for individuality. In Thorn Birds Frank always felt that his mother was far superior to her",,2019.0,11,0,0,True,,,,,,1370,118522018,W. Warda,,,,,,,,,,,Art,

We applied Janet Helms's White Racial Identity Development (WRID) model among white U.S. youth (8-14 years old) to address this research gap. WRID centers racism and white supremacy, offering a framework to analyze white racial identity in the context of systemic inequity. Using longitudinal, qualitative analysis, we found age-related change over time, with some evidence of increasing resistance to racism.

1374,"Biased Representation of Politicians in Google and Wikipedia Search? The Joint Effect of Party Identity, Gender Identity and Elections","ABSTRACT Web search engines have become an important and trusted source when people seek political information. Even though previous research suggests that information about politicians in traditional and new media can provide content that makes stereotypes based on gender and party, little is known about the presence of such bias in search engines, which function as information gatekeepers in the digital age. Using quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques on a novel data set of members of the German parliament, this study examines whether search engine suggestions, i.e. search predictions, for politicians differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on the gender and party of the politician. It also explores whether the search engine representation of politicians changes around elections. The study further compares gender and party differences in search engine results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of the same politicians, as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from Google. The results suggest that politicians’ representation in search engines and Wikipedia are structured by a joint effect of their gender and party identity. While Google suggestions provide less personal information about female politicians belonging to a right-wing party compared to their male counterparts, this relationship is not observable for left-wing parties. Moreover, there are changes in gender biases around the election. In Wikipedia articles, politicians belonging to right-wing parties are represented with more personal information compared to politicians belonging to left ones, an effect which is even stronger for females.",,2020.0,75,5,0,False,,,,,,1374,144832530,Franziska Pradel,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

1377,"Compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To evaluate compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain.


BACKGROUND
Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations in the work context. In these particularly stressful situations, many professionals may develop compassion fatigue or burnout, which puts them at risk for mental health problems.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional online survey.


METHODS
A total of 506 healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) who were working in healthcare centres during the COVID-19 pandemic participated. Compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout were assessed with the Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire (ProQoL), and perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Socio-demographic and occupational variables were also analysed. Data were collected during the period of the highest incidence of cases and highest mortality rates due to COVID-19 in Spain. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational studies.


RESULTS
Physicians had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while nurses had higher compassion satisfaction scores. Perceived stress scores were similar in both occupations. Professionals working in specific COVID-19 units and in emergency departments had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while levels of compassion satisfaction and perceived stress were similar regardless of the workplace.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Despite the health crisis situation and its implications for healthcare professionals, the levels of compassion fatigue and burnout have remained moderate/high. However, compassion satisfaction seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering and due to their perceived social recognition. It is necessary to implement interventions that help improve compassion satisfaction and prevent burnout and compassion fatigue among professionals in the long term.",Journal of Clinical Nursing,2020.0,58,246,15,True,"Evaluating compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain found compassion satisfaction seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering andDue to their perceived social recognition.",,,,,1377,1412720303,M.

1378,Volume and Verve: Understanding Correction/Behavioral Warnings in Teacher-Child Classroom Interactions Involving an African American Kindergarten Student.,"Purpose Using a framework of culturally and linguistically responsive classroom management, this study employed both quantitative and qualitative analyses of ethnographic data to illustrate patterns of corrections/behavioral warnings in teacher-child interactions for an African American child in the classroom. Method Three child participants and their teacher were recruited for the study: MJ, an African American kindergartner, the focal child, and two same-sex Filipino classmates who spoke a nonmainstream dialect of English, Ben and Leo, for frame of reference. None of the three boys were diagnosed with language-learning difficulties. Data analyses included (a) categorical analyses of observational field notes taken across a 7-week period of classroom observation and (b) situated discourse analysis taken from video-recorded small group literacy lessons also in the classroom. Results Two key findings emerged. First, MJ, the focal participant, received a relatively high frequency of correction/behavioral warnings, both relative to the other forms of teacher-initiated interaction and also relative to his two classmates. Second, the majority of MJ's corrections/behavioral warnings were directed toward his volume and verve-features that have been associated with the communication style of many African American students. Conclusions We need to include teachers and administrators in our discussions about the communication style of African American students and broaden these discussions to explicitly consider the influence of nonverbal features, such as volume and verve, on patterns of teacher-student communication interactions. In particular, such communication features may be contributing to high-stakes outcomes for African American children, such as referrals, diagnoses, educational placements, and disciplinary actions.","Language, Speech & Hearing Services in Schools",2021.0,39,1,0,False,"Teachers and administrators need to include teachers and administrators in discussions about the communication style of African American students and broaden these discussions to explicitly consider the influence of nonverbal features, such as volume and verve, on patterns of teacher-student communication interactions.",,,,,1378,40196998,Megan-Brette Hamilton,1998553,L.

1379,Political economics of gender relations in information and communication technologies in agricultural development. The case of knowledge-based platforms for farmers in Kenya,"Face a l’explosion demographique des pays a faible revenu en Afrique sub-saharienne, l’agriculture joue un role primordial pour garantir la securite alimentaire. Le secteur agricole est de plus la principale source d'emploi dans cette region. Les femmes constituent la principale main-d'œuvre agricole de ces pays. En raison de leur role cle dans le secteur agricole, les agricultrices sont prioritaires dans les interventions politiques. Par ailleurs, dans ces pays, le conseil agricole et le partage des connaissances sont necessaires pour s’adapter a de nouvelles contraintes. Depuis quelques annees, les technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC) ont permis le developpement de nouveaux outils visant a ameliorer la portee et l’efficacite du conseil. Les gouvernements de ces pays sont cependant confrontes a des critiques concernant l'impact de ces outils, qui peuvent egalement contribuer a une fracture numerique touchant plus particulierement les femmes qui travaillent dans les exploitations agricoles familiales.La these de doctorat analyse comment les outils TIC tiennent compte des rapports de genre, et de la situation des femmes qui travaillent sur l’exploitation agricole familiale. La these est fondee sur le cas du Kenya. Elle est focalisee sur le developpement des plateformes de connaissances, un instrument TIC utilise par le Gouvernement kenyan pour atteindre les objectifs de politiques publiques. Ce pays est emblematique car il fait l'hypothese que les plateformes peuvent etre inclusives des agricultrices.Pour cette recherche, le travail s'appuie sur trois approches d’economie institutionnelle : l’economie feministe, la theorie de la regulation, et l'economie des services. Il presente un cadre methodologique et conceptuel, developpe pour analyser l'integration des rapports de genre dans les plateformes aux echelles macro, meso et micro.Les resultats montrent que les rapports de genre sont presentes associes a un objectif d'equite pour le Gouvernement Kenyan. L'analyse confirme que les plateformes sont considerees comme de nouveaux outils d'inclusion du systeme de vulgarisation du gouvernement. La typologie de plateformes developpee dans ce travail montre cependant que ces instruments peuvent etre une source d'inegalite. Il s'agit en particulier de l'inegalite d'acces pour les agricultrices et de services standardises qui ne correspondent pas aux attentes de ces femmes. La conjugaison de differentes approches economiques institutionnelles a permis d'analyser comment les evolutions institutionnelles affectent l'inclusion des objectifs d’egalite des sexes dans l’intervention publique et dans le fonctionnement effectif des plateformes. Les resultats presentent des leviers d’action pouvant etre pris en consideration par les politiques et les concepteurs des plateformes, pour une tenir compte des rapports de genre dans ce systeme de vulgarisation agricole et eviter d’engendrer de nouvelles discrimination. L'analyse revele l'importance de disposer d'un espace d'intervention publique et de coordination dans ce nouveau systeme de conseil agricole base sur les TICs.",,2018.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,1379,90488693,Madeleine Jönsson,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,

It examines the different affordances provided by dating apps, and whether users feel the technology has influenced their sexual practices and views on long-term relationships, monogamy and other romantic ideals. This study shows that dating apps are intermediaries through which individuals engage in strategic performances in pursuit of love, sex and intimacy.

Those who gain a good reputation are often preferred as interaction partners and are consequently better able to access support through cooperative relationships with others. However, investing in prosocial displays can sometimes yield social costs: excessively generous individuals risk losing their good reputation, and even being vilified, ostracised or antisocially punished. As a consequence, people frequently try to downplay their prosocial actions or hide them from others. In this review, we explore when and why investments in prosocial behaviour are likely to yield social costs. We propose two key features of interactions that make it more likely that generous individuals will incur social costs when: (a) observers infer that helpful behaviour is motivated by strategic or selfish motives; and (b) observers infer that helpful behaviour is detrimental to them. We describe how the cognition required to consider ulterior motives emerges over development and how these tendencies vary across cultures – and discuss how the potential for helpful actions to result in social costs might place boundaries on prosocial behaviour as well as limiting the contexts in which it might occur.

It was found that HFCD-induced atherosclerotic index such as dyslipidemia, atherosclerotic plaque, inflammation, and gut microbiota dysfunction could be reduced by GPE treatment. GPE treatment could decrease Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria abundance, and increase Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes population. Moreover, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio increased significantly after treatment with GPE. After treatment with GPE, the relative abundance of trimethylamine-producing intestinal bacteria Clostridioides and Desulfovibrionaceae decreased while butyrate-producing bacteria such as Eubacterium, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella increased significantly. The GPE group demonstrated higher SCFAs concentrations in the fecal sample, such as Acetic Acid, Propionic Acid, and Butyric Acid.

1392,Organisation des soins non programmés : intérêt de la mise en place d'une consultation de médecine générale au service d'urgence du centre hospitalier de Moulins-Yzeure,"Introduction : Les soins non programmes et leur prise en charge sont un probleme de sante publique. Ils sont definis comme des soins repondant a une urgence ressentie mais ne relevant pas medicalement de l’urgence. Dans le contexte de saturation des services d’urgence (SU) et de demographie medicale en baisse, les demandes de soins non programmes pesent de plus en plus dans notre systeme de sante. Le bassin Moulinois et le Centre hospitalier de Moulins-Yzeure n’echappent pas a ce constat. 
Objectif : Mettre en place une consultation de medecine generale (CMG) afin d’assurer aux patients relevant des soins non programmes, parmi ceux accueillis au SU ou appelant le Samu-Centre 15, un parcours de soins adapte vers la ressource medicale appropriee tout en gardant un niveau de securite optimal. Evaluer regulierement l’activite de la CMG pour l’adapter et en faire ressortir ses interets et ses limites. 
Methode : Etude observationnelle descriptive, quantitative, menee du 13 novembre 2018 au 30 avril 2019. En journee, les patients etaient orientes vers la CMG, selon le protocole etabli, par l’infirmier(e) organisateur(trice) de l’accueil (IOA) du SU ou le medecin regulateur du Samu-Centre 15, avec prise de rendez-vous. Les patients orientes par le Samu-Centre 15 devaient passer par l’IOA. En cas de doute sur l’orientation, l’IOA contactait l’interne effectuant la CMG. L’analyse portait sur le parcours de soins, sur les caracteristiques des patients et leur satisfaction. Elle portait aussi sur l’activite de la CMG et son impact sur la penibilite ressentie au travail des urgentistes. 
Resultats : Il y a eu 659 consultations effectuees sur 101 jours travailles. L’âge median des patients etait de 33 ans. Les principaux problemes de sante traites etaient des pathologies infectieuses et osteo-articulaires. La demande de soins non programmes predominait en milieu de matinee. 
L’IOA a oriente 90,1 % des patients de la CMG. 3,9 % des patients eligibles selon le protocole n’ont pas ete vus a la CMG. Le taux de reorientation au decours de la CMG vers le SU ou un specialiste en urgence etait de 2,9 %. 
En comparaison aux patients equivalents pris en charge au SU en 2018, le delai d’attente median est passe de 81 a 20 minutes (p<0,001) et la duree de prise en charge mediane est passee de 161 a 45 minutes (p<0,001). Les patients etaient satisfaits de l’organisation de la CMG a 98,9 %. 
L’activite moyenne de la CMG etait de 6,5 consultations par jour et representait 11,9 % des passages au SU sur la meme periode. L’activite de la CMG etait plus elevee les jours de moindre activite de la medecine generale de ville. Dans 76,2 % des cas, la CMG a reduit le sentiment de penibilite au travail des urgentistes. 
Conclusion : La CMG a assure un parcours de soins adapte aux patients relevant des soins non programmes, dans l’interet de ces derniers, tout en ayant un impact positif sur le service d’urgence. L’efficacite et la securite de la CMG reposaient sur la methode d’orientation, la prise d’un rendez-vous dans un delai court, la communication entre l’IOA et l’interne effectuant la consultation et, si necessaire, une reorientation des patients sans difficulte. 
Afin de perenniser cette demarche, au-dela de la CMG, une organisation collective de la gestion des soins non programmes pour le territoire de sante Moulinois necessiterait l’implication conjointe d’une structure de regulation, de la medecine de ville et de l’hopital.",,2019.0,0,0,0,False,,,,,,1392,1582316188,Pierre-Yves Deguelle,,,,,,,,,,,Political Science,
1393,"The gender-affirmative life span approach: A developmental model for clinical work with transgender and gender-diverse children, adolescents, and adults.","The gender-affirmative life span approach (GALA) is an innovative therapeutic framework for promoting the mental health of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) clients of all ages. Based in interdisciplinary philosophical foundations, GALA proposes that TGD clients can be supported in psychotherapy through (a) developing gender literacy, (b) building resiliency, (c) moving beyond the binary, (d) exploring pleasure-oriented sexuality, and (e) making connections to medical interventions. Psychotherapy incorporating these 5 core components is developmentally tailored for children, adolescents, young adults, or older adults. Developing gender literacy is the process of understanding how sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation are distinct but interconnected concepts, as well as learning to identify oppressive practices in TGD people's lives. Building resiliency involves learning how to overcome adversity and effectively cope with challenging situations in life. Resiliency-building also involves having social support networks to share these difficulties and gain support. Gender and sexual binaries pathologize nonconformity and limit the full range of healthy gender and sexual expression. Moving beyond the binary to a spectrum approach allows for the inclusion and affirmation of all gender identities and expressions. Unfortunately, research and practice have largely focused on negative sexual outcomes for TGD people. Thus, age-appropriate psychotherapy aimed at developing sex-positive pleasure and satisfaction is critical. Lastly, gender-competent mental health practitioners need to have knowledge about, and skills to refer for, medical interventions, when appropriate.

1395,Artificial Intelligence-Based Approach for Misogyny and Sarcasm Detection from Arabic Texts,"Social media networking is a prominent topic in real life, particularly at the current moment. The impact of comments has been investigated in several studies. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are just a few of the social media networks that are used to broadcast different news worldwide. In this paper, a comprehensive AI-based study is presented to automatically detect the Arabic text misogyny and sarcasm in binary and multiclass scenarios. The key of the proposed AI approach is to distinguish various topics of misogyny and sarcasm from Arabic tweets in social media networks. A comprehensive study is achieved for detecting both misogyny and sarcasm via adopting seven state-of-the-art NLP classifiers: ARABERT, PAC, LRC, RFC, LSVC, DTC, and KNNC. To fine tune, validate, and evaluate all of these techniques, two Arabic tweets datasets (i.e., misogyny and Abu Farah datasets) are used. For the experimental study, two scenarios are proposed for each case study (misogyny or sarcasm): binary and multiclass problems. For misogyny detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT classifier with 91.0% for binary classification scenario and 89.0% for the multiclass scenario. For sarcasm detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT as well with 88% for binary classification scenario and 77.0% for the multiclass scenario.

1396,Counterfactually Augmented Data and Unintended Bias: The Case of Sexism and Hate Speech Detection,"Counterfactually Augmented Data (CAD) aims to improve out-of-domain generalizability, an indicator of model robustness. The improvement is credited to promoting core features of the construct over spurious artifacts that happen to correlate with it. Yet, over-relying on core features may lead to unintended model bias. Especially, construct-driven CAD—perturbations of core features—may induce models to ignore the context in which core features are used. Here, we test models for sexism and hate speech detection on challenging data: non-hate and non-sexist usage of identity and gendered terms.

1401,Overview of Abusive and Threatening Language Detection in Urdu at FIRE 2021,"With the growth of social media platform influence, the effect of their misuse becomes more and more impactful. The importance of automatic detection of threatening and abusive language can not be overestimated. However, most of the existing studies and state-of-the-art methods focus on English as the target language, with limited work on low- and medium-resource languages. In this paper, we present two shared tasks of abusive and threatening language detection for the Urdu language which has more than 170 million speakers worldwide. Both are posed as binary classification tasks where participating systems are required to classify tweets in Urdu into two classes, namely: (i) Abusive and Non-Abusive for the first task, and (ii) Threatening and Non-Threatening for the second. We present two manually annotated datasets containing tweets labelled as (i) Abusive and Non-Abusive, and (ii) Threatening and Non-Threatening. The abusive dataset contains 2400 annotated tweets in the train part and 1100 annotated tweets in the test part. The threatening dataset contains 6000 annotated tweets in the train part and 3950 annotated tweets in the test part. We also provide logistic regression and BERT-based baseline classifiers for both tasks. In this shared task, 21 teams from six countries registered for participation (India, Pakistan, China, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan), 10 teams submitted their runs for Subtask A, which is Abusive Language Detection and 9 teams submitted their runs for Subtask B, which is Threatening Language detection, and seven teams submitted their technical reports.

1402,Exploring Data Augmentation Strategies for Hate Speech Detection in Roman Urdu,"In an era where social media platform users are growing rapidly, there has been a marked increase in hateful content being generated; to combat this, automatic hate speech detection systems are a necessity. For this purpose, researchers have recently focused their efforts on developing datasets, however, the vast majority of them have been generated for the English language, with only a few available for low-resource languages such as Roman Urdu. Furthermore, what few are available have small number of samples that pertain to hateful classes and these lack variations in topics and content. Thus, deep learning models trained on such datasets perform poorly when deployed in the real world. To improve performance the option of collecting and annotating more data can be very costly and time consuming. Thus, data augmentation techniques need to be explored to exploit already available datasets to improve model generalizability. In this paper, we explore different data augmentation techniques for the improvement of hate speech detection in Roman Urdu. We evaluate these augmentation techniques on two datasets.

It has been shown that cyberbul-lying significantly affects the social tranquillity of the Chadian population, mainly in places of conflict. This article aims to detect hate speech for texts written in “lingua franca”, a mix of the local Chadian and French languages. The dataset consists of 14,000 comments extracted from the most visited Facebook pages and annotated in four categories (hate, offence, insult and neutral) were used for this study. The data were cleaned by Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP) and applied to three word embedding methods such as Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, and Fasttext. Finally, four Machine Learning methods, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), were computed to classify the different categories. The result showed that FastText features representation as input to SVM classifier was the best with 95.4% accuracy for predicting the comment contained insult statement followed by hate statement 93.9%.

1405,Using Twitter to Detect Hate Crimes and Their Motivations: The HateMotiv Corpus,"With the rapidly increasing use of social media platforms, much of our lives is spent online. Despite the great advantages of using social media, unfortunately, the spread of hate, cyberbullying, harassment, and trolling can be very common online. Many extremists use social media platforms to communicate their messages of hatred and spread violence, which may result in serious psychological consequences and even contribute to real-world violence. Thus, the aim of this research was to build the HateMotiv corpus, a freely available dataset that is annotated for types of hate crimes and the motivation behind committing them. The dataset was developed using Twitter as an example of social media platforms and could provide the research community with a very unique, novel, and reliable dataset. The dataset is unique as a consequence of its topic-specific nature and its detailed annotation. The corpus was annotated by two annotators who are experts in annotation based on unified guidelines, so they were able to produce an annotation of a high standard with F-scores for the agreement rate as high as 0.66 and 0.71 for type and motivation labels of hate crimes, respectively.",International Conference on Data Technologies and Applications,2022.0,37,5,0,True,"The aim of this research was to build the HateMotiv corpus, a freely available dataset that is annotated for types of hate crimes and the motivation behind committing them and could provide the research community with a very unique, novel, and reliable dataset.",,"[{'title': 'mdpi.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/7/6/69/pdf?version=1653392719'}]","N Alnazzawi - Data, 2022 - mdpi.com",,1405,3202728,Noha Alnazzawi,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle
1406,Improved two-stage hate speech classification for twitter based on Deep Neural Networks,"Hate speech is a form of online harassment that involves the use of abusive language, and it is commonly seen in social media posts. This sort of harassment mainly focuses on specific group characteristics such as religion, gender, ethnicity, etc and it has both societal and economic consequences nowadays. The automatic detection of abusive language in text postings has always been a difficult task, but it is lately receiving much interest from the scientific community. This paper addresses the important problem of discerning hateful content in social media. The model we propose in this work is an extension of an existing approach based on LSTM neural network architectures, which we appropriately enhanced and fine-tuned to detect certain forms of hatred language, such as racism or sexism, in a short text. The most significant enhancement is the conversion to a two-stage scheme consisting of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classifiers. The output of all One-vs-Rest (OvR) classifiers from the first stage are combined and used to train the second stage classifier, which finally determines the type of harassment. Our study includes a performance comparison of several proposed alternative methods for the second stage evaluated on a public corpus of 16k tweets, followed by a generalization study on another dataset.

1412,Comparing Different Approaches for Detecting Hate Speech in Online Portuguese Comments,"Online Hate Speech (OHS) has been growing dramatically on social media, which has motivated researchers to develop a diversity of methods for its automated detection. However, the detection of OHS in Portuguese is still little studied. To fill this gap, we explored different models that proved to be successful in the literature to address this task. In particular, we have explored transfer learning approaches, based on existing BERT-like pre-trained models. The performed experiments were based on CO-HATE, a corpus of YouTube comments posted by the Portuguese online community that was manually labeled by different annotators. Among other categories, those comments were labeled regarding the presence of hate speech and the type of hate speech, specifically overt and covert hate speech. We have assessed the impact of using annotations from different annotators on the performance of such models. In addition, we have analyzed the impact of distinguishing overt and and covert hate speech. The results achieved show the importance of considering the annotator’s profile in the development of hate speech detection models. Regarding the hate speech type, the results obtained do not allow to make any conclusion on what type is easier to detect. Finally, we show that pre-processing does not seem to have a significant impact on the performance of this specific task. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Computing methodologies → Transfer learning; Social and professional topics → Hate speech; Computing methodologies → Supervised learning; Computing methodologies → Machine learning approaches; Information systems → Clustering and classification",Slate,2022.0,25,0,0,False,"Different models that proved to be successful in the literature to address the detection of OHS in Portuguese are explored, based on existing BERT-like pre-trained models, and the impact of using annotations from different annotators on the performance of such models is assessed.",,"[{'title': 'dagstuhl.de', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/16756/pdf/OASIcs-SLATE-2022-10.pdf'}]","BC Matos, RB Santos, P Carvalho… - 11th Symposium on …, 2022 - drops.dagstuhl.de","[{'name': 'P Carvalho', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=43X2-LgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=43X2-LgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '43X2-LgAAAAJ'}]",1412,2179338989,Bernardo Cunha Matos,2179436970,R.

1413,Entropy-based Attention Regularization Frees Unintended Bias Mitigation from Lists,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) models risk overfitting to specific terms in the training data, thereby reducing their performance, fairness, and generalizability. E.g., neural hate speech detection models are strongly influenced by identity terms like gay, or women, resulting in false positives, severe unintended bias, and lower performance.Most mitigation techniques use lists of identity terms or samples from the target domain during training. However, this approach requires a-priori knowledge and introduces further bias if important terms are neglected.Instead, we propose a knowledge-free Entropy-based Attention Regularization (EAR) to discourage overfitting to training-specific terms. An additional objective function penalizes tokens with low self-attention entropy.We fine-tune BERT via EAR: the resulting model matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance for hate speech classification and bias metrics on three benchmark corpora in English and Italian.EAR also reveals overfitting terms, i.e., terms most likely to induce bias, to help identify their effect on the model, task, and predictions.",Findings,2022.0,62,9,0,False,"The resulting model matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance for hate speech classification and bias metrics on three benchmark corpora in English and Italian and reveals overfitting terms, i.e., terms most likely to induce bias, to help identify their effect on the model, task, and predictions.",,,,,1413,1481857041,Giuseppe Attanasio,2101317501,Debora Nozza,2022288,Dirk Hovy,1750105,Elena Baralis,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle

1416,On Improving Automated Detection of Cyber-Bully in Social Networks with Constrained Datasets: A Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach,"During the recent years, online users, particularly in social networks, have witnessed an upsurge in racism, sexism, and other types of aggressive and cyberbully content, which are often manifested through offensive, abusive, or hateful speech and harassment. This can lead to severe physical and psychological stress in young children and adolescents, leading to even suicides and negatively affecting social policies. Therefore, there is a significant need to identify and regulate harassing content posted on the Internet in a smart, automated, and accurate manner. With this aim, in this paper, we design and develop a hierarchical framework comprising machine learning algorithms in order of higher computational complexity to adaptatively switch among them for efficiently detecting hateful and abusive content. We combine simple machine learning models such as Naive Bayes/Logistic Regression classifiers with customized calibration and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, and compare them with the much stronger deep learning techniques.

1418,Homophobic and Hate Speech Detection Using Multilingual-BERT Model on Turkish Social Media,"Homophobic expressions are a form of insulting the sexual orientation or personality of people. Severe psychological traumas may occur in people who are exposed to this type of communication. It is important to develop automatic classification systems based on language models to examine social media content and distinguish homophobic discourse. This study aims to present a pre-trained Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (M-BERT) model that can successfully detect whether Turkish comments on social media contain homophobic or related hate comments (i.e., sexist, severe humiliation, and defecation expressions). Comments in the Homophobic-Abusive Turkish Comments (HATC) dataset were collected from Instagram to train the detection models. The HATC dataset was manually labeled at the sentence level and combined with the Abusive Turkish Comments (ATC) dataset that has developed in our previous study. The HATC dataset has been balanced using the resampling method and two forms of the dataset (i.e., resHATC and original HATC) were used in the experiments. Afterward, the M-BERT model was compared with DL-based models (i.e., Long-Short Term Memory, Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit), Traditional Machine Learning (TML) classifiers (i.e., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and Ensemble Classifiers (i.e., Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting) for the best model selection. The performance of the detection models was evaluated using F1-score, precision, and recall performance metrics.

1419,Mitigating Racial Biases in Toxic Language Detection with an Equity-Based Ensemble Framework,"Recent research has demonstrated how racial biases against users who write African American English exists in popular toxic language datasets. While previous work has focused on a single fairness criteria, we propose to use additional descriptive fairness metrics to better understand the source of these biases. We demonstrate that different benchmark classifiers, as well as two in-process bias-remediation techniques, propagate racial biases even in a larger corpus. We then propose a novel ensemble-framework that uses a specialized classifier that is fine-tuned to the African American English dialect. We show that our proposed framework substantially reduces the racial biases that the model learns from these datasets. We demonstrate how the ensemble framework improves fairness metrics across all sample datasets with minimal impact on the classification performance, and provide empirical evidence for its ability to unlearn the annotation biases towards authors who use African American English. ** Please note that this work may contain examples of offensive words and phrases.","Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization",2021.0,38,10,2,True,"It is demonstrated how the ensemble framework improves fairness metrics across all sample datasets with minimal impact on the classification performance, and empirical evidence for its ability to unlearn the annotation biases towards authors who use African American English is provided.",,,,,1419,2129454749,Matan Halevy,2146887091,Camille Harris,143709703,A.

1421,Comparing Deep Learning Models for Multi-label Classification of Arabic Abusive Texts in Social Media,": Facing up to abusive texts in social networks is gradually becoming a mainstream NLP research topic. How-ever, the detection of its speciﬁc related forms is still scarce. The majority of automatic solutions cast the problem into a two-class or three-class classiﬁcation issue not taking into account its variety of aspects. Speciﬁcally in the Arabic language, as one of the most widely spoken languages, social media abusive texts are written in a mix of different dialects which further complicates the detection process. The goal of this research is to detect eight speciﬁc subtasks of abusive language in Arabic social platforms, namely Racism, Sexism, Xenophobia, Violence, Hate, Pornography, Religious hatred, and LGBTQ a Hate. To conduct our experiments, we evaluated the performance of CNN, BiLSTM, and BiGRU deep neural networks with pre-trained Arabic word embeddings (AraVec). We also investigated the recent Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with its special tokenizer. Results show that DNN classiﬁers achieved nearly the same performance with an overall average precision of 85%. Moreover, although all the deep learning models obtained very close results, BERT slightly outperformed the others with a precision of 90% and a micro-averaged F1 score of 79%.",International Conference on Software and Data Technologies,2022.0,17,0,0,False,"The goal of this research is to detect eight speciﬁc subtasks of abusive language in Arabic social platforms, namely Racism, Sexism, Xenophobia, Violence, Hate, Pornography, Religious hatred, and LGBTQ a Hate.",,,,,1421,2110144578,S.

1424,Emotion Based Hate Speech Detection using Multimodal Learning,"In recent years, monitoring hate speech and offensive language on social media platforms has become paramount due to its widespread usage among all age groups, races, and ethnicities. Consequently, there have been substantial research efforts towards automated detection of such content using Natural Language Processing (NLP). While successfully filtering textual data, no research has focused on detecting hateful content in multimedia data. With increased ease of data storage and the exponential growth of social media platforms, multimedia content proliferates the internet as much as the text data. Nevertheless, it escapes the automatic filtering systems. Hate speech and offensiveness can be detected in multimedia primarily via three modalities, i.e., visual, acoustic, and verbal. Our preliminary study concluded that the most essential features in classifying hate speech would be the speaker’s emotional state and its influence on the spoken words, therefore limiting our current research to these modalities. This paper proposes the first multimodal deep learning framework to combine the auditory features representing emotion and the semantic features to detect hateful content. Our results demonstrate that incorporating emotional attributes leads to significant improvement over text-based models in detecting hateful multimedia content. This paper also presents a new Hate Speech Detection Video Dataset (HSDVD) collected for the purpose of multimodal learning as no such dataset exists today.",ArXiv,2022.0,65,6,0,False,This paper proposes the first multimodal deep learning framework to combine the auditory features representing emotion and the semantic features to detect hateful content and demonstrates that incorporating emotional attributes leads to significant improvement over text-based models in detecting hateful multimedia content.,,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06218'}]","A Rana, S Jha - arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.06218, 2022 - arxiv.org",,1424,2154412609,Aneri Rana,2053019028,Sonali Jha,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle
1425,"Half-Day Tutorial on Combating Online Hate Speech: The Role of Content, Networks, Psychology, User Behavior, etc.","While the rise in popularity of social media is seen as a hugely positive development, it is also accompanied by a proliferation of hate speech, which has recently become a major concern. On the one hand, hateful content creates an unsafe environment for certain members of society. On the other hand, manual moderation causes distress to content moderators, and the volume of harmful content is far beyond what human moderators can manually flag and react to. Thus, researchers in machine learning, social computing, and other areas have worked on developing tools to help automate the process. While initially studied as a text classification problem, over time, researchers realized that hate speech is multi-faceted and requires analysis of the role of linguistic expressions, context, and network structure, while using inspiration from psychology and user behavior, among others.

1429,Multilingual HateCheck: Functional Tests for Multilingual Hate Speech Detection Models,"Hate speech detection models are typically evaluated on held-out test sets. However, this risks painting an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of model performance because of increasingly well-documented systematic gaps and biases in hate speech datasets. To enable more targeted diagnostic insights, recent research has thus introduced functional tests for hate speech detection models. However, these tests currently only exist for English-language content, which means that they cannot support the development of more effective models in other languages spoken by billions across the world. To help address this issue, we introduce Multilingual HateCheck (MHC), a suite of functional tests for multilingual hate speech detection models.

1431,Suum Cuique: Studying Bias in Taboo Detection with a Community Perspective,"Prior research has discussed and illustrated the need to consider linguistic norms at the community level when studying taboo (hateful/offensive/toxic etc.) language. However, a methodology for doing so, that is firmly founded on community language norms is still largely absent. This can lead both to biases in taboo text classification and limitations in our understanding of the causes of bias. We propose a method to study bias in taboo classification and annotation where a community perspective is front and center. This is accomplished by using special classifiers tuned for each community’s language. In essence, these classifiers represent community level language norms. We use these to study bias and find, for example, biases are largest against African Americans (7/10 datasets and all 3 classifiers examined). In contrast to previous papers we also study other communities and find, for example, strong biases against South Asians. In a small scale user study we illustrate our key idea which is that common utterances, i.e., those with high alignment scores with a community (community classifier confidence scores) are unlikely to be regarded taboo. Annotators who are community members contradict taboo classification decisions and annotations in a majority of instances. This paper is a significant step toward reducing false positive taboo decisions that over time harm minority communities.",Findings,2022.0,49,0,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11401'}]","O Khalid, J Rusert, P Srinivasan - arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.11401, 2022 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'O Khalid', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ITMiRhkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=ITMiRhkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'ITMiRhkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'P Srinivasan', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O6STnAUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=O6STnAUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'O6STnAUAAAAJ'}]",1431,1693244,Osama Khalid,147146848,Jonathan Rusert,144684950,P.

1433,Building towards Automated Cyberbullying Detection: A Comparative Analysis,"The increased use of social media among digitally anonymous users, sharing their thoughts and opinions, can facilitate participation and collaboration. However, this anonymity feature which gives users freedom of speech and allows them to conduct activities without being judged by others can also encourage cyberbullying and hate speech. Predators can hide their identity and reach a wide range of audience anytime and anywhere.

1435,Data Bootstrapping Approaches to Improve Low Resource Abusive Language Detection for Indic Languages,"Abusive language is a growing concern in many social media platforms. Repeated exposure to abusive speech has created physiological effects on the target users. Thus, the problem of abusive language should be addressed in all forms for online peace and safety. While extensive research exists in abusive speech detection, most studies focus on English. Recently, many smearing incidents have occurred in India, which provoked diverse forms of abusive speech in online space in various languages based on the geographic location. Therefore it is essential to deal with such malicious content. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we demonstrate a large-scale analysis of multilingual abusive speech in Indic languages. We examine different interlingual transfer mechanisms and observe the performance of various multilingual models for abusive speech detection for eight different Indic languages. We also experiment to show how robust these models are on adversarial attacks. Finally, we conduct an in-depth error analysis by looking into the models’ misclassified posts across various settings.

1436,A Multitask Learning Framework for Abuse Detection and Emotion Classification,"The rapid development of online social media makes abuse detection a hot topic in the field of emotional computing. However, most natural language processing (NLP) methods only focus on linguistic features of posts and ignore the influence of users’ emotions. To tackle the problem, we propose a multitask framework combining abuse detection and emotion classification (MFAE) to expand the representation capability of the algorithm on the basis of the existing pretrained language model. Specifically, we use bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) as the encoder to generate sentence representation. Then, we used two different decoders for emotion classification and abuse detection, respectively. To further strengthen the influence of the emotion classification task on abuse detection, we propose a cross-attention (CA) component in the decoder, which further improves the learning effect of our multitask learning framework. Experimental results on five public datasets show that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.",Algorithms,2022.0,54,2,0,True,A multitask framework combining abuse detection and emotion classification (MFAE) to expand the representation capability of the algorithm on the basis of the existing pretrained language model by using bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) as the encoder to generate sentence representation.,,"[{'title': 'mdpi.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/15/4/116/pdf'}]","Y Huang, R Song, F Giunchiglia, H Xu - Algorithms, 2022 - mdpi.com","[{'name': 'F Giunchiglia', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yDTC2DgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=yDTC2DgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'yDTC2DgAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'H Xu', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9KW7Z-oAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=9KW7Z-oAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '9KW7Z-oAAAAJ'}]",1436,,Yucheng Huang,2067622524,Rui Song,1720285,Fausto Giunchiglia,2118498995,Hao Xu,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle

1440,ToxiGen: A Large-Scale Machine-Generated Dataset for Adversarial and Implicit Hate Speech Detection,"Toxic language detection systems often falsely flag text that contains minority group mentions as toxic, as those groups are often the targets of online hate. Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle with detecting implicitly toxic language.To help mitigate these issues, we create ToxiGen, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups. We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of ToxiGen and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on human-written data substantially. We also demonstrate that ToxiGen can be used to fight machine-generated toxicity as finetuning improves the classifier significantly on our evaluation subset.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2022.0,68,30,2,False,"ToxiGen, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups, is created and it is demonstrated that finetuning a toxicity classifier on data improves its performance on human-written data substantially.",,,,,1440,32452740,Thomas Hartvigsen,119902504,Saadia Gabriel,2542427,H.

1441,Arabic Document Classification: Performance Investigation of Preprocessing and Representation Techniques,"With the increasing number of online social posts, review comments, and digital documentations, the Arabic text classification (ATC) task has been hugely required for many spontaneous natural language processing (NLP) applications, especially within the coronavirus pandemics. The variations in the meaning of the same Arabic words could directly affect the performance of any AI-based framework. This work aims to identify the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms through preprocessing and representation techniques. This effectiveness is measured via different AI-based classification techniques. Basically, the ATC process is influenced by several factors such as stemming in preprocessing, method of feature extraction and selection, nature of datasets, and classification algorithm. To improve the overall classification performance, preprocessing techniques are mainly used to convert each Arabic word into its root and decrease the representation dimension among the datasets. Feature extraction and selection always play crucial roles to represent the Arabic text in a meaningful way and improve the classification accuracy rate. The selected classifiers in this study are performed based on various feature selection algorithms. The overall classification evaluation results are compared using different classifiers such as multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear SVC. All of these AI classifiers are evaluated using five balanced and unbalanced benchmark datasets: BBC Arabic corpus, CNN Arabic corpus, Open-Source Arabic corpus (OSAc), ArCovidVac, and AlKhaleej. The evaluation results show that the classification performance strongly depends on the preprocessing technique, representation methods and classification technique, and the nature of datasets used. For the considered benchmark datasets, the linear SVC has outperformed other classifiers overall when prominent features are selected.",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022.0,79,4,0,True,"This work aims to identify the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms through preprocessing and representation techniques and shows that the classification performance strongly depends on the preprocessing technique, representation methods and classification technique, and the nature of datasets used.",Html,"[{'title': 'hindawi.com', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2022/3720358/'}]","AY Muaad, HJ Davanagere, DS Guru… - Mathematical …, 2022 - hindawi.com","[{'name': 'AY Muaad', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZbX-qJ0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=ZbX-qJ0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'ZbX-qJ0AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'DS Guru', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oWIOLCAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=oWIOLCAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'oWIOLCAAAAAJ'}]",1441,2123504137,A.

1443,Deep Learning Approach for Classifying the Aggressive Comments on Social Media: Machine Translated Data Vs Real Life Data,"Aggressive comments on social media negatively impact human life. Such offensive contents are responsible for depression and suicidal-related activities. Since online social networking is increasing day by day, the hate content is also increasing. Several investigations have been done on the domain of cyberbullying, cyberaggression, hate speech, etc. The majority of the inquiry has been done in the English language. Some languages (Hindi and Bangla) still lack proper investigations due to the lack of a dataset. This paper particularly worked on the Hindi, Bangla, and English datasets to detect aggressive comments and have shown a novel way of generating machine-translated data to resolve data unavailability issues. A fully machine-translated English dataset has been analyzed with the models such as the Long Short term memory model (LSTM), Bidirectional Long-short term memory model (BiLSTM), LSTM-Autoencoder, word2vec, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT-2) to make an observation on how the models perform on a machine-translated noisy dataset. We have compared the performance of using the noisy data with two more datasets such as raw data, which does not contain any noises, and semi-noisy data, which contains a certain amount of noisy data. We have classified both the raw and semi-noisy data using the aforementioned models. To evaluate the performance of the models, we have used evaluation metrics such as F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall. We have achieved the highest accuracy on raw data using the gpt2 model, semi-noisy data using the BERT model, and fully machine-translated data using the BERT model. Since many languages do not have proper data availability, our approach will help researchers create machine-translated datasets for several analysis purposes.",2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2022.0,42,2,0,True,"This paper worked on the Hindi, Bangla, and English datasets to detect aggressive comments and has shown a novel way of generating machine-translated data to resolve data unavailability issues and will help researchers create machine- translated datasets for several analysis purposes.",Pdf,"[{'title': 'researchsquare.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1519060/latest.pdf'}]",N Ahmed - 2022 - researchsquare.com,,1443,2127959940,Mst.

1444,GraphNLI: A Graph-based Natural Language Inference Model for Polarity Prediction in Online Debates,"Online forums that allow participatory engagement between users have been transformative for public discussion of important issues. However, debates on such forums can sometimes escalate into full blown exchanges of hate or misinformation. An important tool in understanding and tackling such problems is to be able to infer the argumentative relation of whether a reply is supporting or attacking the post it is replying to. This so called polarity prediction task is difficult because replies may be based on external context beyond a post and the reply whose polarity is being predicted. We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walk techniques to capture the wider context of a discussion thread in a principled fashion. Specifically, we propose methods to perform root-seeking graph walks that start from a post and captures its surrounding context to generate additional embeddings for the post. We then use these embeddings to predict the polarity relation between a reply and the post it is replying to.

1446,"Socially Responsible AI Algorithms: Issues, Purposes, and Challenges","In the current era, people and society have grown increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. AI has the potential to drive us towards a future in which all of humanity flourishes. It also comes with substantial risks for oppression and calamity. Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI’s indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives. We further discuss how to leverage this framework to improve societal well-being through protection, information, and prevention/mitigation.

1448,Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders with Encoding Dependency Information using Graph Convolutional Network,"Figurative language is using words in a way that deviates from the conventional order and meaning in order to ask the reader or listener to understand the meaning by virtue of its relation to some other meaning or concept. It is a rapidly growing area in Natural Language Processing, including the processing of irony, sarcasm, as well as other figures. With irony, language is employed in a figurative and subtle way to mean the opposite of what is literally stated.

1449,Material transformers: deep learning language models for generative materials design,"Pre-trained transformer language models (LMs) on large unlabeled corpus have produced state-of-the-art results in natural language processing, organic molecule design, and protein sequence generation. However, no such models have been applied to learn the composition patterns for the generative design of material compositions. Here we train a series of seven modern transformer models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, BLMM, BART, and RoBERTa) for materials design using the expanded formulas of the ICSD, OQMD, and Materials Projects databases. Six different datasets with/out non-charge-neutral or EB samples are used to benchmark the generative design performances and uncover the biases of modern transformer models for the generative design of materials compositions. Our experiments show that the materials transformers based on causal LMs can generate chemically valid material compositions with as high as 97.61% to be charge neutral and 91.22% to be electronegativity balanced, which has more than six times higher enrichment compared to the baseline pseudo-random sampling algorithm. Our LMs also demonstrate high generation novelty and their potential in new materials discovery is proved by their capability to recover the leave-out materials. We also find that the properties of the generated compositions can be tailored by training the models with selected training sets such as high-bandgap samples. Our experiments also show that different models each have their own preference in terms of the properties of the generated samples and their running time complexity varies a lot.

1450,Beyond Plain Toxic: Detection of Inappropriate Statements on Flammable Topics for the Russian Language,"Toxicity on the Internet, such as hate speech, offenses towards particular users or groups of people, or the use of obscene words, is an acknowledged problem. However, there also exist other types of inappropriate messages which are usually not viewed as toxic, e.g. as they do not contain explicit offences. Such messages can contain covered toxicity or generalizations, incite harmful actions (crime, suicide, drug use), provoke “heated” discussions. Such messages are often related to particular sensitive topics, e.g. on politics, sexual minorities, social injustice which more often than other topics, e.g. cars or computing, yield toxic emotional reactions. At the same time, clearly not all messages within such flammable topics are inappropriate. A machinery able to detect inappropriateness in a conversation could be useful for: (i) making the communication on the Internet safer, more productive and inclusive by flagging truly inappropriate content passing toxicity filters while not banning messages blindly topically; (ii) for detection of inappropriate messages generated by automatic systems, e.g. neural chatbots, due to bias in the training data; (iii) for filtering training data from bias for language models (e.g. BERT and GPT-2). Towards this end, in this work, we present two text collections labelled according to binary notion of inapropriateness and a multinomial notion of sensitive topic. Assuming that the notion of inappropriateness is common among people of the same culture, we base our approach on human intuitive understanding of what is not acceptable and harmful. To objectivise the notion of inappropriateness, we define it in a data-driven way though crowdsourcing. Namely we run a large-scale annotation study asking workers if a given chatbot textual statement could harm reputation of a company created it. Acceptably high values of interannotator agreement suggest that the notion of inappropriateness exists and can be uniformly understood by different people.

Cities can use this data for an exceedingly heterogeneous range of purposes such as traffic, parking and public safety. Quite evidently, public safety is an essential pillar of these interconnected, instrumented and intelligent cities. The big data from cyber‐physical systems and social media platforms can be used for predictive policing to identify potential criminal activities, abuse, offenders, and victims of abuse. This study offers a systematic literature review on the use of soft computing techniques for abuse detection in the complex cyber–physical–social big data systems in cognitive smart cities. The objective is to define and identify the diverse concept of abuse and systematize techniques for automatic abuse detection for cyber abuse detection on social media and real‐time abuse detection using IoT. The cyber abuse studies on social media platforms have further been categorized as cyber‐hate and cyberbullying whereas the real‐time abuse includes studies using Internet of cyber‐physical systems. As in a cognitive smart city, citizens expect more from their urban environments with minimal intervention, this study helps to establish the need to capture situational context and awareness in real‐time and foster the need to develop a proactive as well as reactive safety mechanism to mitigate the risks of online abuse.

1454,"Towards Identifying Social Bias in Dialog Systems: Frame, Datasets, and Benchmarks","Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. The research of open-domain dialog systems has been greatly prospered by neural models trained on large-scale corpora, however, such corpora often introduce various safety problems (e.g., offensive languages, biases, and toxic behaviors) that significantly hinder the deployment of dialog systems in practice. Among all these unsafe issues, addressing social bias is more complex as its negative impact on marginalized populations is usually expressed implicitly, thus requiring normative reasoning and rigorous analysis. In this paper, we focus our investigation on social bias detection of dialog safety problems. We first propose a novel DIALBIAS FRAME for analyzing the social bias in conversations pragmatically, which considers more comprehensive bias-related analyses rather than simple dichotomy annotations. Based on the proposed framework, we further introduce CDAIL-BIAS DATASET that, to our knowledge, is the first well-annotated Chinese social bias dialog dataset. In addition, we establish several dialog bias detection benchmarks at different label granularities and input types (utterance-level and context-level).

Specifically, a multihot byte-level scheme is developed to significantly reduce the dimension of one-hot character-level encoding caused by the multiplicity of instance-scarce non-ASCII characters. In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective weighting approach for fusing n-gram features to empower the classical logistic regression. Surprisingly, it outperforms well-tuned representative neural networks greatly. As a continual effort toward text moderation, we endeavor to analyze the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithm bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), which works well in context understanding but performs poorly on intentional word obfuscations.

1460,Mitigating Toxic Degeneration with Empathetic Data: Exploring the Relationship Between Toxicity and Empathy,"Large pre-trained neural language models have supported the effectiveness of many NLP tasks, yet are still prone to generating toxic language hindering the safety of their use. Using empathetic data, we improve over recent work on controllable text generation that aims to reduce the toxicity of generated text. We find we are able to dramatically reduce the size of fine-tuning data to 7.5-30k samples while at the same time making significant improvements over state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation of up to 3.4% absolute reduction (26% relative) from the original work on 2.3m samples, by strategically sampling data based on empathy scores. We observe that the degree of improvements is subject to specific communication components of empathy. In particular, the more cognitive components of empathy significantly beat the original dataset in almost all experiments, while emotional empathy was tied to less improvement and even underperforming random samples of the original data.

1461,Proactively Reducing the Hate Intensity of Online Posts via Hate Speech Normalization,"Curbing online hate speech has become the need of the hour; however, a blanket ban on such activities is infeasible for several geopolitical and cultural reasons. To reduce the severity of the problem, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, hate speech normalization, that aims to weaken the intensity of hatred exhibited by an online post. The intention of hate speech normalization is not to support hate but instead to provide the users with a stepping stone towards non-hate while giving online platforms more time to monitor any improvement in the user's behavior. To this end, we manually curated a parallel corpus - hate texts and their normalized counterparts (a normalized text is less hateful and more benign). We introduce NACL, a simple yet efficient hate speech normalization model that operates in three stages - first, it measures the hate intensity of the original sample; second, it identifies the hate span(s) within it; and finally, it reduces hate intensity by paraphrasing the hate spans. We perform extensive experiments to measure the efficacy of NACL via three-way evaluation (intrinsic, extrinsic, and human-study).

1463,Listening to Affected Communities to Define Extreme Speech: Dataset and Experiments,"Building on current work on multilingual hate speech (e.g., Ousidhoum et al. (2019)) and hate speech reduction (e.g., Sap et al. (2020)), we present XTREMESPEECH, a new hate speech dataset containing 20,297 social media passages from Brazil, Germany, India and Kenya. The key novelty is that we directly involve the affected communities in collecting and annotating the data – as opposed to giving companies and governments control over defining and combatting hate speech. This inclusive approach results in datasets more representative of actually occurring online speech and is likely to facilitate the removal of the social media content that marginalized communities view as causing the most harm.

1464,When More Data Lead Us Astray: Active Data Acquisition in the Presence of Label Bias,"An increased awareness concerning risks of algorithmic bias has driven a surge of efforts around bias mitigation strategies. A vast majority of the proposed approaches fall under one of two categories: (1) imposing algorithmic fairness constraints on predictive models, and (2) collecting additional training samples. Most recently and at the intersection of these two categories, methods that propose active learning under fairness constraints have been developed. However, proposed bias mitigation strategies typically overlook the bias presented in the observed labels. In this work, we study fairness considerations of active data collection strategies in the presence of label bias. We first present an overview of different types of label bias in the context of supervised learning systems. We then empirically show that, when overlooking label bias, collecting more data can aggravate bias, and imposing fairness constraints that rely on the observed labels in the data collection process may not address the problem. Our results illustrate the unintended consequences of deploying a model that attempts to mitigate a single type of bias while neglecting others, emphasizing the importance of explicitly differentiating between the types of bias that fairness-aware algorithms aim to address, and highlighting the risks of neglecting label bias during data collection.",AAAI Conference on Human Computation & Crowdsourcing,2022.0,0,1,0,True,"This work studies fairness considerations of active data collection strategies in the presence of label bias and empirically shows that, when overlooking label bias, collecting more data can aggravate bias, and imposing fairness constraints that rely on the observed labels in the data collection process may not address the problem.",,,,,1464,2111160199,Yunyi Li,1406443102,Maria De-Arteaga,1388405043,M.

1465,DEA-RNN: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Cyberbullying Detection in Twitter Social Media Platform,"Cyberbullying (CB) has become increasingly prevalent in social media platforms. With the popularity and widespread use of social media by individuals of all ages, it is vital to make social media platforms safer from cyberbullying. This paper presents a hybrid deep learning model, called DEA-RNN, to detect CB on Twitter social media network. The proposed DEA-RNN model combines Elman type Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with an optimized Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (DEA) for fine-tuning the Elman RNN’s parameters and reducing training time. We evaluated DEA-RNN thoroughly utilizing a dataset of 10000 tweets and compared its performance to those of state-of-the-art algorithms such as Bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM), RNN, SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Random Forests (RF). The experimental results show that DEA-RNN was found to be superior in all the scenarios. It outperformed the considered existing approaches in detecting CB on Twitter platform. DEA-RNN was more efficient in scenario 3, where it has achieved an average of 90.45% accuracy, 89.52% precision, 88.98% recall, 89.25% F1-score, and 90.94% specificity.",IEEE Access,2022.0,59,3,0,True,The proposed DEA-RNN model combines Elman type Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with an optimized Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (DEA) for fine-tuning the Elman RNN’s parameters and reducing training time to detect CB on Twitter social media network.,,"[{'title': 'ieee.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/9668973/09718597.pdf'}]","BAH Murshed, J Abawajy, S Mallappa, MAN Saif… - IEEE …, 2022 - ieeexplore.ieee.org","[{'name': 'BAH Murshed', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vPcP9vkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=vPcP9vkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'vPcP9vkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'J Abawajy', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GpSY7JEAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=GpSY7JEAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'GpSY7JEAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'MAN Saif', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rofd_f4AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=rofd_f4AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'rofd_f4AAAAJ'}]",1465,2046867228,Belal Abdullah Hezam Murshed,1703056,J.

1466,“Did You Miss My Comment or What?” Understanding Toxicity in Open Source Discussions,"Online toxicity is ubiquitous across the internet and its negative impact on the people and that online communities that it effects has been well documented. However, toxicity manifests differently on various platforms and toxicity in open source communities, while frequently discussed, is not well understood. We take a first stride at understanding the characteristics of open source toxicity to better inform future work on designing effective intervention and detection methods. To this end, we curate a sample of 100 toxic GitHub issue discussions combining multiple search and sampling strategies. We then qualitatively analyze the sample to gain an understanding of the characteristics of open-source toxicity. We find that the pervasive forms of toxicity in open source differ from those observed on other platforms like Reddit or Wikipedia. In our sample, some of the most prevalent forms of toxicity are entitled, demanding, and arrogant comments from project users as well as insults arising from technical disagreements. In addition, not all toxicity was written by people external to the projects; project members were also common authors of toxicity. We also discuss the implications of our findings.

1468,"Can Machines Help Us Answering Question 16 in Datasheets, and In Turn Reflecting on Inappropriate Content?","This paper contains images and descriptions that are offensive in nature. Large datasets underlying much of current machine learning raise serious issues concerning inappropriate content such as offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety. This calls for increased dataset documentation, e.g., using datasheets. They, among other topics, encourage to reflect on the composition of the datasets. So far, this documentation, however, is done manually and therefore can be tedious and error-prone, especially for large image datasets. Here we ask the arguably “circular” question of whether a machine can help us reflect on inappropriate content, answering Question 16 in Datasheets. To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets—ImageNet and OpenImages—produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",2022.0,56,6,0,True,"This paper proposes to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist in the documentation process of large image datasets, and suggests that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 in Datasheets on inappropriate image content.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06675'}]","P Schramowski, C Tauchmann, K Kersting - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2022 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'P Schramowski', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GD481RkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=GD481RkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'GD481RkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'C Tauchmann', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u18vlssAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=u18vlssAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'u18vlssAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'K Kersting', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QY-earAAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=QY-earAAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'QY-earAAAAAJ'}]",1468,40896023,P.

1469,"Minority stress, pandemic stress, and mental health among gender diverse young adults: Gender dysphoria and emotion dysregulation as mediators.","Gender diverse people in the United States are uniquely vulnerable to deleterious health outcomes because of long-enshrined systems of oppression and marginalization in American society. Trans young adults are especially vulnerable to these deleterious outcomes owing to their unique position in the life course. However, more research is needed on the mechanisms through which this marginalization contributes to mental health disparities in trans populations. Using a minority stress framework and online cross-sectional survey design, the current study examines potential mediators of the relationship between transgender identity-related distal stress and psychological distress from late May to early July 2020 in a sample of transgender young adults (N = 239;ages 18-29). More than half the sample scored above the K6 cutoff for severe psychological distress. Distal stress had a significant direct (beta = .17, SE = .04, t = 2.76, p = .006) and indirect effect on psychological distress. Distal stress was indirectly associated with psychological distress through gender dysphoria (beta = .04;95% CI [.001, .10]) and emotion dysregulation (beta = .16;95% CI [.09, .23]). COVID-19 pandemic stressors were also positively associated with psychological distress (beta = .36, SE = .12, t = 5.95, p < .001). Results highlight the significant mental health burden facing the trans community especially in the COVID-19 context, support a conceptualization of gender dysphoria as connected to experiences of oppression, and affirm the relevance of emotion dysregulation within minority stress frameworks. Mental health resources cognizant of the specific challenges experienced by trans young adults as well as policy changes that seek to address underlying structural transphobia in American culture and institutions are urgently needed.

This highlights the mechanisms underlying trans health disparities and the importance of recognizing transphobic/cisnormative experiences and systems of oppression when conducting research, creating policies, and/or providing services to support the transgender community.

1470,Are “Intersectionally Fair” AI Algorithms Really Fair to Women of Color? A Philosophical Analysis,"A growing number of studies on fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) use the notion of intersectionality to measure AI fairness. Most of these studies take intersectional fairness to be a matter of statistical parity among intersectional subgroups: an AI algorithm is “intersectionally fair” if the probability of the outcome is roughly the same across all subgroups defined by different combinations of the protected attributes. This paper identifies and examines three fundamental problems with this dominant interpretation of intersectional fairness in AI. First, the dominant approach is so preoccupied with the intersection of attributes/categories (e.g., race, gender) that it fails to address the intersection of oppression (e.g., racism, sexism), which is more central to intersectionality as a critical framework. Second, the dominant approach faces a dilemma between infinite regress and fairness gerrymandering: it either keeps splitting groups into smaller subgroups or arbitrarily selects protected groups. Lastly, the dominant view fails to capture what it really means for AI algorithms to be fair, in terms of both distributive and non-distributive fairness. I distinguish a strong sense of AI fairness from a weak sense that is prevalent in the literature, and conclude by envisioning paths towards strong intersectional fairness in AI.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",2022.0,59,6,0,False,"A strong sense of AI fairness is distinguished from a weak sense that is prevalent in the literature, and paths towards strong intersectional fairness in AI are envisioned.",,"[{'title': 'facctconference.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://facctconference.org/static/pdfs_2022/facct22-3533114.pdf'}]","Y Kong - 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability …, 2022 - dl.acm.org","[{'name': 'Y Kong', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hwgix2UAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Hwgix2UAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Hwgix2UAAAAJ'}]",1470,117102547,Youjin Kong,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,"Book, JournalArticle"

1472,Demographic-Reliant Algorithmic Fairness: Characterizing the Risks of Demographic Data Collection in the Pursuit of Fairness,"Most proposed algorithmic fairness techniques require access to demographic data in order to make performance comparisons and standardizations across groups, however this data is largely unavailable in practice, hindering the widespread adoption of algorithmic fairness. Through this paper, we consider calls to collect more data on demographics to enable algorithmic fairness and challenge the notion that discrimination can be overcome with smart enough technical methods and sufficient data. We show how these techniques largely ignore broader questions of data governance and systemic oppression when categorizing individuals for the purpose of fairer algorithmic processing. In this work, we explore under what conditions demographic data should be collected and used to enable algorithmic fairness methods by characterizing a range of social risks to individuals and communities. For the risks to individuals we consider the unique privacy risks of sensitive attributes, the possible harms of miscategorization and misrepresentation, and the use of sensitive data beyond data subjects’ expectations. Looking more broadly, the risks to entire groups and communities include the expansion of surveillance infrastructure in the name of fairness, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing what it means to be part of a demographic group, and ceding the ability to define what constitutes biased or unfair treatment. We argue that, by confronting these questions before and during the collection of demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually mitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of oppression. Towards this end, we assess privacy-focused methods of data collection and use and participatory data governance structures as proposals for more responsibly collecting demographic data.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",2022.0,132,5,1,True,"It is argued that, by confronting questions before and during the collection of demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually mitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of oppression.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01038'}]","MK Andrus, S Villeneuve - arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.01038, 2022 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'MK Andrus', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VSsTq14AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=VSsTq14AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'VSsTq14AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Villeneuve', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JWVAuycAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=JWVAuycAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'JWVAuycAAAAJ'}]",1472,144916965,McKane Andrus,2164036250,Sarah Villeneuve,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,"Book, JournalArticle"
1473,Verbal Aggressions Detection in Mexican Tweets,". Verbal aggressions are a struggle that a great number of social media users have to face daily. Some users take advantage of the anonymity that social media give them and offend a person, a group of people, or a concept. The majority of proposals which pretend to detect aggressive comments on social media handle it as a classiﬁcation problem. Although there are a lot of techniques to face this problem in English, there is a lack of proposals in Spanish. In this work, we propose using several Spanish lexicons which have a collection of words that have been weighted according to different criteria like affective, dimensional, and emotional values.

1475,CyberAgressionAdo-v1: a Dataset of Annotated Online Aggressions in French Collected through a Role-playing Game,"Over the past decades, the number of episodes of cyber aggression occurring online has grown substantially, especially among teens. Most solutions investigated by the NLP community to curb such online abusive behaviors consist of supervised approaches relying on annotated data extracted from social media. However, recent studies have highlighted that private instant messaging platforms are major mediums of cyber aggression among teens. As such interactions remain invisible due to the app privacy policies, very few datasets collecting aggressive conversations are available for the computational analysis of language. In order to overcome this limitation, in this paper we present the CyberAgressionAdo-V1 dataset, containing aggressive multiparty chats in French collected through a role-playing game in high-schools, and annotated at different layers. We describe the data collection and annotation phases, carried out in the context of a EU and a national research projects, and provide insightful analysis on the different types of aggression and verbal abuse depending on the targeted victims (individuals or communities) emerging from the collected data.",International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation,2022.0,36,0,0,False,"This paper presents the CyberAgressionAdo-V1 dataset, containing aggressive multiparty chats in French collected through a role-playing game in high-schools, and annotated at different layers, and provides insightful analysis on the different types of aggression and verbal abuse depending on the targeted victims (individuals or communities) emerging from the collected data.",Pdf,"[{'title': 'github.io', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://aollagnier.github.io/publications/LREC2022_AO.pdf'}]","A Ollagnier, E Cabrio, S Villata, C Blaya - aollagnier.github.io","[{'name': 'A Ollagnier', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HNpnAc0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=HNpnAc0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'HNpnAc0AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'E Cabrio', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEP0YzwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=hEP0YzwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'hEP0YzwAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Villata', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sy9G0pUAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Sy9G0pUAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Sy9G0pUAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'C Blaya', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tem0PNYAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Tem0PNYAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Tem0PNYAAAAJ'}]",1475,2101927,Anaïs Ollagnier,1772891,Elena Cabrio,1725656,S.

The results indicate a positive bias toward female subjects for a German version of GPT-2 and similar tendencies for GPT-3.

Historically, state-of-the-art approaches have been developed for and benchmarked against English datasets, while other languages have had to catch up and deal with inevitable linguistic challenges. This paper offers a survey with practical and linguistic connotations, showcasing the complications and challenges tied to the application of modern Text Classification algorithms to languages other than English. We engage this subject from the perspective of the Italian language, and we discuss in detail issues related to the scarcity of task-specific datasets, as well as the issues posed by the computational expensiveness of modern approaches. We substantiate this by providing an extensively researched list of available datasets in Italian, comparing it with a similarly sought list for French, which we use for comparison. In order to simulate a real-world practical scenario, we apply a number of representative methods to custom-tailored multilabel classification datasets in Italian, French, and English.

1480,Robots Enact Malignant Stereotypes,"Stereotypes, bias, and discrimination have been extensively documented in Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Computer Vision (CV) [18, 80], Natural Language Processing (NLP) [6], or both, in the case of large image and caption models such as OpenAI CLIP [14]. In this paper, we evaluate how ML bias manifests in robots that physically and autonomously act within the world. We audit one of several recently published CLIP-powered robotic manipulation methods, presenting it with objects that have pictures of human faces on the surface which vary across race and gender, alongside task descriptions that contain terms associated with common stereotypes. Our experiments definitively show robots acting out toxic stereotypes with respect to gender, race, and scientifically-discredited physiognomy, at scale. Furthermore, the audited methods are less likely to recognize Women and People of Color. Our interdisciplinary sociotechnical analysis synthesizes across fields and applications such as Science Technology and Society (STS), Critical Studies, History, Safety, Robotics, and AI. We find that robots powered by large datasets and Dissolution Models (sometimes called “foundation models”, e.g. CLIP) that contain humans risk physically amplifying malignant stereotypes in general; and that merely correcting disparities will be insufficient for the complexity and scale of the problem. Instead, we recommend that robot learning methods that physically manifest stereotypes or other harmful outcomes be paused, reworked, or even wound down when appropriate, until outcomes can be proven safe, effective, and just. Finally, we discuss comprehensive policy changes and the potential of new interdisciplinary research on topics like Identity Safety Assessment Frameworks and Design Justice to better understand and address these harms.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",2022.0,119,2,0,True,"This paper finds that robots powered by large datasets and Dissolution Models that contain humans risk physically amplifying malignant stereotypes in general; and recommends that robot learning methods that physically manifest stereotypes or other harmful outcomes be paused, reworked, or even wound down when appropriate, until outcomes can be proven safe, effective, and just.",,"[{'title': 'acm.org', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533138'}]","A Hundt, W Agnew, V Zeng, S Kacianka… - 2022 ACM Conference …, 2022 - dl.acm.org","[{'name': 'A Hundt', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N0JJHwkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=N0JJHwkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'N0JJHwkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'W Agnew', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_B-tud4AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=_B-tud4AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '_B-tud4AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Kacianka', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EF4j3cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=-EF4j3cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '-EF4j3cAAAAJ'}]",1480,47936089,Andrew T Hundt,27377925,William Agnew,2171355310,Vicky Zeng,1891742,Severin Kacianka,145223968,M.

1481,"Predicting Divorce Prospect Using Ensemble Learning: Support Vector Machine, Linear Model, and Neural Network","A divorce is a legal step taken by married people to end their marriage. It occurs after a couple decides to no longer live together as husband and wife. Globally, the divorce rate has more than doubled from 1970 until 2008, with divorces per 1,000 married people rising from 2.6 to 5.5. Divorce occurs at a rate of 16.9 per 1,000 married women. According to the experts, over half of all marriages ends in divorce or separation in the United States. A novel ensemble learning technique based on advanced machine learning algorithms is proposed in this study. The support vector machine (SVM), passive aggressive classifier, and neural network (MLP) are applied in the context of divorce prediction. A question-based dataset is created by the field specialist. The responses to the questions provide important information about whether a marriage is likely to turn into divorce in the future. The cross-validation is applied in 5 folds, and the performance results of the evaluation metrics are examined.

1483,Should We Translate? Evaluating Toxicity in Online Comments when Translating from Portuguese to English,"Social media and online discussion platforms suffer from the prevalence of uncivil behavior, such as harassment and abuse, seeking to curb toxic comments. There are several approaches to classifying toxic comments automatically. Some of them have more resources and are more advanced in English, thus, stimulating the task of translating the text from a specific language to English. While researchers have shown evidence that this practice is indicated for certain tasks, such as sentiment analysis, little is known in the context of toxicity identification. In this research, we assess the performance of a freely available model for toxic language detection in online comments called Perspective API, widely adopted by some famous news media sites to identify different toxicity classes in online comments. For that, we obtained comments in Portuguese from two Brazilian news media websites during a politically polarized situation as a use case. Then, this dataset was translated to English and compared to four baseline datasets, two composed of highly toxic comments, one in Portuguese and other in English, and two composed of neutral comments, also one in Portuguese and other in English – all of them in its original language, not translated. Finally, human-annotated comments from the news comments dataset were analyzed to assess the scores provided by the Perspective API for the original and the translated versions. Results indicate that keeping the texts in their original language is preferable, even in comparing different languages. Nevertheless, if the translated version is strictly necessary, ways of dealing with the situation were suggested to preserve as much information as possible from the original version.",Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web,2022.0,29,0,0,False,"Results indicate that keeping the texts in their original language is preferable, even in comparing different languages, while if the translated version is strictly necessary, ways of dealing with the situation were suggested to preserve as much information from the original version.",Pdf,"[{'title': 'utfpr.edu.br', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://pessoal.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br/thiagoh/papers/Should_we_translate__webmedia_2022.pdf'}]","JK KOBELLARZ, TH SILVA - 2022 - pessoal.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br","[{'name': 'JK KOBELLARZ', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2C_nkboAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=2C_nkboAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '2C_nkboAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'TH SILVA', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0yNKFcwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0yNKFcwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '0yNKFcwAAAAJ'}]",1483,151053359,Jordan K.

1484,Is Your Toxicity My Toxicity? Exploring the Impact of Rater Identity on Toxicity Annotation,"Machine learning models are commonly used to detect toxicity in online conversations. These models are trained on datasets annotated by human raters. We explore how raters' self-described identities impact how they annotate toxicity in online comments. We first define the concept of Specialized Rater Pools: rater pools formed based on raters' self-described identities, rather than at random. We formed three such rater pools for this study - specialized rater pools of raters from the U.S. who identify as African American, LGBTQ, and those who identify as neither. Each of these rater pools annotated the same set of comments, which contains many references to these identity groups. We found that rater identity is a statistically significant factor in how raters will annotate toxicity for identity-related annotations. Using preliminary content analysis, we examined the comments with the most disagreement between rater pools and found nuanced differences in the toxicity annotations. Next, we trained models on the annotations from each of the different rater pools, and compared the scores of these models on comments from several test sets.

1486,”You have to prove the threat is real”: Understanding the needs of Female Journalists and Activists to Document and Report Online Harassment,"Online harassment is a major societal challenge that impacts multiple communities. Some members of community, like female journalists and activists, bear significantly higher impacts since their profession requires easy accessibility, transparency about their identity, and involves highlighting stories of injustice. Through a multi-phased qualitative research study involving a focus group and interviews with 27 female journalists and activists, we mapped the journey of a target who goes through harassment. We introduce PMCR framework, as a way to focus on needs for Prevention, Monitoring, Crisis and Recovery. We focused on Crisis and Recovery, and designed a tool to satisfy a target’s needs related to documenting evidence of harassment during the crisis and creating reports that could be shared with support networks for recovery. Finally, we discuss users’ feedback to this tool, highlighting needs for targets as they face the burden and offer recommendations to future designers and scholars on how to develop tools that can help targets manage their harassment.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2022.0,85,0,0,True,,,,,,1486,40571524,Nitesh Goyal,70836028,L.

1487,Do Men Have No Need for “Feminist” Artificial Intelligence? Agentic and Gendered Voice Assistants in the Light of Basic Psychological Needs,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is supposed to perform tasks autonomously, make competent decisions, and interact socially with people. From a psychological perspective, AI can thus be expected to impact users’ three Basic Psychological Needs (BPNs), namely (i) autonomy, (ii) competence, and (iii) relatedness to others. While research highlights the fulfillment of these needs as central to human motivation and well-being, their role in the acceptance of AI applications has hitherto received little consideration. Addressing this research gap, our study examined the influence of BPN Satisfaction on Intention to Use (ITU) an AI assistant for personal banking. In a 2×2 factorial online experiment, 282 participants (154 males, 126 females, two non-binary participants) watched a video of an AI finance coach with a female or male synthetic voice that exhibited either high or low agency (i.e., capacity for self-control). In combination, these factors resulted either in AI assistants conforming to traditional gender stereotypes (e.g., low-agency female) or in non-conforming conditions (e.g., high-agency female). Although the experimental manipulations had no significant influence on participants’ relatedness and competence satisfaction, a strong effect on autonomy satisfaction was found. As further analyses revealed, this effect was attributable only to male participants, who felt their autonomy need significantly more satisfied by the low-agency female assistant, consistent with stereotypical images of women, than by the high-agency female assistant. A significant indirect effects model showed that the greater autonomy satisfaction that men, unlike women, experienced from the low-agency female assistant led to higher ITU. The findings are discussed in terms of their practical relevance and the risk of reproducing traditional gender stereotypes through technology design.",Frontiers in Psychology,2022.0,141,3,0,True,,Html,"[{'title': 'nih.gov', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9239329/'}]","L Moradbakhti, S Schreibelmayr, M Mara - Frontiers in psychology, 2022 - ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","[{'name': 'L Moradbakhti', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qPYIa-EAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=qPYIa-EAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'qPYIa-EAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Mara', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cryfi4cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=cryfi4cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'cryfi4cAAAAJ'}]",1487,2170418279,Laura Moradbakhti,1603720348,Simon Schreibelmayr,2424581,Martina Mara,,,,,,,Medicine,JournalArticle

1491,"Predicting Divorce Prospect Using Ensemble Learning: Support Vector Machine, Linear Model, and Neural Network","A divorce is a legal step taken by married people to end their marriage. It occurs after a couple decides to no longer live together as husband and wife. Globally, the divorce rate has more than doubled from 1970 until 2008, with divorces per 1,000 married people rising from 2.6 to 5.5. Divorce occurs at a rate of 16.9 per 1,000 married women. According to the experts, over half of all marriages ends in divorce or separation in the United States. A novel ensemble learning technique based on advanced machine learning algorithms is proposed in this study. The support vector machine (SVM), passive aggressive classifier, and neural network (MLP) are applied in the context of divorce prediction. A question-based dataset is created by the field specialist. The responses to the questions provide important information about whether a marriage is likely to turn into divorce in the future. The cross-validation is applied in 5 folds, and the performance results of the evaluation metrics are examined. The accuracy score is 100%, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve accuracy score, recall score, the precision score, and the F1 accuracy score are close to 97% confidently.

1492,Environmentally sustainable development and use of artificial intelligence in health care,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) can transform health care by delivering medical services to underserved areas, while also filling gaps in health care provider availability. However, AI may also lead to patient harm due to fatal glitches in robotic surgery, bias in diagnosis, or dangerous recommendations. Despite concerns ethicists have identified in the use of AI in health care, the most significant consideration ought not be vulnerabilities in the software, but the environmental impact of AI. Health care emits a significant amount of carbon in many countries. As AI becomes an essential part of health care, ethical reflection must include the potential to negatively impact the environment. As such, this article will first overview the carbon emissions in health care. It will, second, offer five reasons why carbon calculations are insufficient to address sustainability in health care. Third, the article will derive normative concepts from the goals of medicine, the principles of biomedical ethics, and green bioethics—the very locus in which AI in health care sits—to propose health, justice, and resource conservation as criteria for sustainable AI in health care. In the fourth and final part of the article, examples of sustainable and unsustainable development and use of AI in health care will be evaluated through the three‐fold lens of health, justice, and resource conservation.

Our goal was not to audit this image captioning system, but rather to develop normatively grounded measurement techniques, in turn providing an opportunity to reflect on the many challenges involved. We propose multiple measurement techniques for each type of harm. We argue that by doing so, we are better able to capture the multi-faceted nature of each type of harm, in turn improving the (collective) validity of the resulting measurements.

Emerging ethical approaches have attempted to ﬁlter pretraining material, but such approaches have been ad hoc and failed to take into account context. We offer an approach to ﬁltering grounded in law, which has directly addressed the tradeoffs in ﬁltering material. First, we gather and make available the Pile of Law, a ∼ 256GB (and growing) dataset of open-source English-language legal and administrative data, covering court opinions, contracts, administrative rules, and legislative records. Pretraining on the Pile of Law may potentially help with legal tasks that have the promise to improve access to justice. Second, we distill the legal norms that governments have developed to constrain the inclusion of toxic or private content into actionable lessons for researchers and discuss how our dataset reﬂects these norms. Third, we show how the Pile of Law offers researchers the opportunity to learn such ﬁltering rules directly from the data, providing an exciting new research direction in model-based processing.

1497,Facebook and Hate speech: Analyzing Relationship between Consumers' Attributes and Islamic Sectarian Content on Social Media in Pakistan,"Religious extremism has been one of the major areas of concern for communication scholars throughout the world. In Pakistan, the form of sectarian division on the ideological occasion of Muharram has always been observed. As a result, a lot of hate speech has been used on social media by the followers of Shia and Sunni sects. This study not only aims to determine a relationship between the demographics of the users who post the hateful materials on the social media regarding any sect, it also aspires to investigate whether the socio-economic background, education or gender plays any role in determining the level of hate speech against any sect. For this purpose, while drawing upon the theory of Uses and Gratification, a sample of 100 users of Facebook were surveyed through a questionnaire developed on 5- point Likert scale. It was found that the people from different sects like to post and share the sectarian hate speech. The study found that there was a strong relationship in the level of religiosity and posting of hate speech, however, the more the tilt towards religious practices, the more users post hateful speech on Facebook pages, Furthermore, it was also found that the education level and  socio- economic status also play important role in this arena; the better they live (more household income  and  more  study),  the  lesser  they  post  such  hateful  material.",Journal of Islamic Thought and Civilization,2021.0,19,1,0,True,,,,,,1497,2063957127,Abidullah Abid,118722952,Savera Shami,1954435,Ayesha Binte Ashfaq,,,,,,,Sociology,Review

1500,FairLex: A Multilingual Benchmark for Evaluating Fairness in Legal Text Processing,"We present a benchmark suite of four datasets for evaluating the fairness of pre-trained language models and the techniques used to fine-tune them for downstream tasks.

1502,Public Attention and Sentiment toward Intimate Partner Violence Based on Weibo in China: A Text Mining Approach,"The mobile internet has resulted in intimate partner violence (IPV) events not being viewed as interpersonal and private issues. Such events become public events in the social network environment. IPV has become a public health issue of widespread concern. It is a challenge to obtain systematic and detailed data using questionnaires and interviews in traditional Chinese culture, because of face-saving and the victim’s shame factors. However, online comments about specific IPV events on social media provide rich data in understanding the public’s attitudes and emotions towards IPV. By applying text mining and sentiment analysis to the field of IPV, this study involved construction of a Chinese IPV sentiment dictionary and a complete research framework. We analyzed the trends of the Chinese public’s emotional evolution concerning IPV events from the perspectives of a time series as well as geographic space and social media. The results show that the anonymity of social networks and the guiding role of opinion leaders result in traditional cultural factors such as face-saving and family shame for IPV events being no longer applicable, leading to the spiral of an anti-silence effect. Meanwhile, in the process of public emotional communication, anger often overwhelms reason, and the spiral of silence remains in effect in social media. In addition, there are offensive words used in the IPV event texts that indicate misogyny in emotional, sexual, economic and psychological abuse. Fortunately, mainstream media, as crucial opinion leaders in the social network, can have a positive role in guiding public opinion, improving people’s ability to judge the validity of network information, and formulating people’s rational behaviour.",Healthcare,2022.0,96,4,1,True,"The results show that the anonymity of social networks and the guiding role of opinion leaders result in traditional cultural factors such as face-saving and family shame for IPV events being no longer applicable, leading to the spiral of an anti-silence effect.",,,,,1502,46485370,Heng Xu,31807072,J.

1503,Risks and Opportunities to Ensure Equity in the Application of Big Data Research in Public Health.,"The big data revolution presents an exciting frontier to expand public health research, broadening the scope of research and increasing the precision of answers. Despite these advances, scientists must be vigilant against also advancing potential harms toward marginalized communities. In this review, we provide examples in which big data applications have (unintentionally) perpetuated discriminatory practices, while also highlighting opportunities for big data applications to advance equity in public health. Here, big data is framed in the context of the five Vs (volume, velocity, veracity, variety, and value), and we propose a sixth V, virtuosity, which incorporates equity and justice frameworks. Analytic approaches to improving equity are presented using social computational big data, fairness in machine learning algorithms, medical claims data, and data augmentation as illustrations. Throughout, we emphasize the biasing influence of data absenteeism and positionality and conclude with recommendations for incorporating an equity lens into big data research. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 43 is April 2022.

1504,Online interventions for reducing hate speech and cyberhate: A systematic review,"Abstract Background The unique feature of the Internet is that individual negative attitudes toward minoritized and racialized groups and more extreme, hateful ideologies can find their way onto specific platforms and instantly connect people sharing similar prejudices. The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television, radio, youth conferences, and text messaging campaigns, interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged. Objectives This review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate. Search Methods We systematically searched 2 database aggregators, 36 individual databases, 6 individual journals, and 34 websites, as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature, and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature. Inclusion Criteria We included randomized and rigorous quasi‐experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10–17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background, religious affiliation, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, or citizenship status. Data Collection and Analysis The systematic search covered January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2020, with searches conducted between August 19, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24, 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention, sample, outcomes, and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta‐analysis on two independent effect sizes. Main Results Two studies were included in the meta‐analysis, one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta‐analysis we chose the treatment arm from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study. However, we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects, while the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = −0.134, 95% confidence interval [−0.321, −0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as “low risk” on the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study as “some” risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and “high risk” for selective outcome reporting bias. The Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as “some concern” for the selective outcome reporting bias domain. Authors' Conclusions The evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi‐experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions, addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software, and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including both extremist and non‐extremist individuals in future intervention studies. We provide suggestions for how future research on online hate speech/cyberhate interventions can fill these gaps moving forward.",Campbell Systematic Reviews,2021.0,114,4,0,False,,,"[{'title': 'wiley.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cl2.1243'}, {'title': 'Full View', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:3gTISGb-OzEJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&num=20&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=2022&as_yhi=2022&scillfp=3521846364861531886&oi=lle'}]","S Windisch, S Wiedlitzka, A Olaghere… - Campbell Systematic …, 2022 - Wiley Online Library","[{'name': 'S Windisch', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AsXiXs0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=AsXiXs0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'AsXiXs0AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'A Olaghere', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mj404oQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Mj404oQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Mj404oQAAAAJ'}]",1504,101702350,Steven Windisch,118532648,Susann Wiedlitzka,81071203,Ajima Olaghere,2088997129,Elizabeth M.

1506,Youths as targets: factors of online hate speech victimization among adolescents and young adults,"
 A significant number of adolescents and young adults are targeted by online hate speech. The effect of such hateful utterances can involve severe psychological harm, especially for youths who have to master developmental tasks. Therefore, drawing on criminology’s routine activity theory, this study investigates the factors that help explain why youths become victimized through online hate speech. We conducted a national quota-based quantitative online survey that was representative of adolescent and young adult online users (N = 1,180). In the results, we identified six latent profiles of young targets with overall high or low online hate speech victimization, victimization due to gender, migration background, religion, or political engagement on behalf of the queer community. While relative subjective deprivation, political participation, and lower digital media literacy positively predicted overall victimization through online hate speech, being targeted was more likely for members of the aforementioned social groups and those showing political engagement.",J.

1508,New futures of work or continued marginalization? The rise of online freelance work and digital platforms,"Workers from historically marginalized populations are an increasingly important, but not-well-understood, set of participants in the narratives being developed about the many futures of work. Here, we argue that the growth of non-standard work and the changes in worker/employer relationships that this reflects, the rising number of independent workers, and the surge of digital labor platforms demand more attention to what these new working arrangements mean for historically marginalized groups. To do so, in this paper we: (1) summarize long-documented inequalities in traditional workplaces, (2) highlight how these issues translate into the under-regulated and fast-evolving landscape of digital labor platforms, and (3) focus on how the emergence of data-driven algorithms and AI technologies may impact these issues. Our discussion draws attention to how HCI researchers can continue to address issues of bias and inequality embedded within technology. In particular, we focus on how issues of bias are diminished, transformed, or exacerbated in emerging forms of digitally-mediated work that seem to be core to discourse on the futures of work.",Symposium on Human-Computer Interaction for Work,2022.0,91,1,0,False,,,,"I Munoz, S Sawyer, M Dunn - … on Human-Computer Interaction for Work, 2022 - dl.acm.org","[{'name': 'I Munoz', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Nm13MQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=4Nm13MQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '4Nm13MQAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Sawyer', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2v_elb8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=2v_elb8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '2v_elb8AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'M Dunn', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRp5gIgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=pRp5gIgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'pRp5gIgAAAAJ'}]",1508,120607986,Isabel Munoz,144245984,S.

1509,Feminist Perspective on Robot Learning Processes,"As different research works report and daily life experiences confirm, learning models can result in biased outcomes. The biased learned models usually replicate historical discrimination in society and typically negatively affect the less represented identities. Robots are equipped with these models that allow them to operate, performing tasks more complex every day. The learning process consists of different stages depending on human judgments. Moreover, the resulting learned models for robot decisions rely on recorded labeled data or demonstrations. Therefore, the robot learning process is susceptible to bias linked to human behavior in society. This imposes a potential danger, especially when robots operate around humans and the learning process can reflect the social unfairness present today. Different feminist proposals study social inequality and provide essential perspectives towards removing bias in various fields. What is more, feminism allowed and still allows to reconfigure numerous social dynamics and stereotypes advocating for equality across people through their diversity. Consequently, we provide a feminist perspective on the robot learning process in this work. We base our discussion on intersectional feminism, community feminism, decolonial feminism, and pedagogy perspectives, and we frame our work in a feminist robotics approach. In this paper, we present an initial discussion to emphasize the relevance of feminist perspectives to explore, foresee, en eventually correct the biased robot decisions.",ArXiv,2022.0,32,2,0,False,"A feminist perspective on the robot learning process is provided, based on intersectional feminism, community feminism, decolonial feminism, and pedagogy perspectives, and framed in a feminist robotics approach.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10853'}]","JV Hurtado, V Mejia - arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.10853, 2022 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'JV Hurtado', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VtbaGhIAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=VtbaGhIAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'VtbaGhIAAAAJ'}]",1509,1641474092,Juana Valeria Hurtado,2151177263,Valentina Mejia,,,,,,,,,Computer Science,JournalArticle

We introduce @MERLOT RESERVE, a model that represents videos jointly over time - through a new training objective that learns from audio, subtitles, and video frames. Given a video, we replace snippets of text and audio with a MASK token; the model learns by choosing the correct masked-out snippet. Our objective learns faster than alternatives, and performs well at scale: we pretrain on 20 million YouTube videos. Empirical results show that @MERLOT RESERVE learns strong multimodal representations. When finetuned, it sets state-of-the-art on Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), TVQA, and Kinetics-600; outperforming prior work by 5%, 7%, and 1.5% respectively. Ablations show that these tasks benefit from audio pretraining - even VCR, a QA task centered around images (without sound). Moreover, our objective enables out-of-the-box prediction, revealing strong multimodal commonsense understanding. In a fully zero-shot setting, our model obtains competitive results on four video tasks, even outperforming supervised approaches on the recently proposed Situated Reasoning (STAR) benchmark.

1512,On the Limitations of Dataset Balancing: The Lost Battle Against Spurious Correlations,"Recent work have shown that deep learn- 001 ing models in NLP are highly sensitive to 002 low-level correlations between simple features 003 and speciﬁc output labels, leading to over- 004 ﬁtting and lack of generalization. To miti- 005 gate this problem, a common practice is to 006 balance datasets by adding new instances or 007 by ﬁltering out “easy” instances (Sakaguchi 008 et al., 2020), culminating in a recent pro- 009 posal to eliminate single-word correlations al- 010 together (Gardner et al., 2021).

In this context intensive cooperation among the Nordic and Baltic countries can be discovered as new normal for transnational development.
The rationale of Nordic and Baltic countries cooperation is common interest in stability, security and welfare in the Baltic Sea region and beyond, and has existed for quite some time. It should be emphasized that the cooperation in the Nordic and Baltic region has overcome many challenges. Nevertheless, the idea of cooperation in this region is stronger than ever. In the light of global and regional political instability, it is crucial to maintain political dialogue, strengthen and develop cooperation between the Nordic and Baltic countries.
A spread of stronger populism uncovered an existential tension of European integration processes. In response to the European-wide crisis it is the possibility for Nordic States react to emerging challenges by deepening the integration between the Nordic countries in the light of European integration processes during their critical moment.
With reference to the context described above, the purpose of the research is to identify the added value of cooperation of Nordic and Baltic countries for further regional development.
The tasks of the research were set as follows: 1) to identify benefits of cooperation among countries in the context of different theories and practices; 2) to analyse the cooperation of the Nordic-Baltic countries in the period from 1990 - 2020 and its implications for growth of Baltic sea region; 3)to discuss the EU macro-regional strategies and identify their added value for further regional development.

1516,"Turkish Speaking Young Adults Attitudes Toward Transgender Individuals: Transphobia, Homophobia and Gender Ideology","ABSTRACT There is wide research investigating negative attitudes and behaviors toward gays and lesbians within Western societies. However, only a small amount of studies have addressed attitudes toward transgender individuals, particularly in non-Western societies with younger populations. This study, therefore, aimed to examine the predictors of transphobic attitudes in north Cyprus using young adults.

1517,Childhood adversities among students at an English University: A latent class analysis,"ABSTRACT University students routinely participate in research, including research on trauma and adversity, but the unique implications of trauma and adversity for educational and developmental outcomes for this group have received less attention. This study surveyed first year undergraduate students at an urban university located in the most ethnically diverse district in England, with the second highest poverty rate. Of 7,110 students, 858 responded; a response rate of 12%. The survey included thirteen questions about adverse events and circumstances before age 18. Four in five students (79%) reported at least one adversity, 51% reported three or more, and 20% reported at least six. Female students reported a higher mean number of adversities than men, but men were significantly more likely to report having been “attacked, stabbed, shot or robbed by threat.” Where comparisons were possible, rates were higher than for the general population or for the only other UK university survey. A Latent Class Analysis produced four groupings. Besides the ’No adversity’ (36%) and “Intermediate” (46%) classes, there were two “High adversity” groups, differentiated by high (12%) or moderate (6%) adversities related to cohabitation (parental separation, lived with depressed person, lived with alcohol/drug user, and lived with incarcerated person). Higher rates of adversities, and latent class membership, were related to predictions that one would not complete one’s degree.

1518,Stress Detection Using Experience Sampling: A Systematic Mapping Study,"Stress has been designated the “Health Epidemic of the 21st Century” by the World Health Organization and negatively affects the quality of individuals’ lives by detracting most body systems. In today’s world, different methods are used to track and measure various types of stress. Among these techniques, experience sampling is a unique method for studying everyday stress, which can affect employees’ performance and even their health by threatening them emotionally and physically. The main advantage of experience sampling is that evaluating instantaneous experiences causes less memory bias than traditional retroactive measures. Further, it allows the exploration of temporal relationships in subjective experiences. The objective of this paper is to structure, analyze, and characterize the state of the art of available literature in the field of surveillance of work stress via the experience sampling method. We used the formal research methodology of systematic mapping to conduct a breadth-first review. We found 358 papers between 2010 and 2021 that are classified with respect to focus, research type, and contribution type. The resulting research landscape summarizes the opportunities and challenges of utilizing the experience sampling method on stress detection for practitioners and academics.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,203,1,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'mdpi.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5693/pdf'}]","G Dogan, FP Akbulut, C Catal, A Mishra - International Journal of …, 2022 - mdpi.com","[{'name': 'FP Akbulut', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fsp1J9gAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=fsp1J9gAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'fsp1J9gAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'C Catal', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PnCoNz8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=PnCoNz8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'PnCoNz8AAAAJ'}]",1518,2164449819,Gulin Dogan,3289054,F.

1521,"Don't ""research fast and break things"": On the ethics of Computational Social Science","As a quintessential social impact science, Computational Social Science (CSS) holds great promise to advance social justice, human flourishing, and biospheric sustainability. However, CSS is also an all-too-human science—conceived in particular social, cultural, and historical contexts and pursued amidst intractable power imbalances, structural inequities, and potential conflicts of interest. Its proponents must thus remain continuously self-critical about the role that values, interests, and power dynamics play in shaping mission-driven research. Likewise, they must take heed of the complicated social and historical conditions surrounding the generation and construction of data as well as the way that the activities and theories of CSS researchers can function to restructure and shape the phenomena that they purport only to measure and analyse. This article is concerned with setting up practical guardrails within the research activities and environments of CSS in response to these dilemmas. It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the field of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as a motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the end-to-end incorporation of habits of responsible research and innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reflection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justifiable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols.

1525,Measuring Structural Racism: A guide for epidemiologists and other health researchers.,"There have been over one hundred years of literature discussing the deleterious influence of racism on health. Much of the literature describes racism as a driver of social determinants of health such as housing, employment, income, and education. More recently, increased attention has been given to measuring the structural nature of a system that advantages one racialized group over others rather than solely relying on individual acknowledgement of racism. Despite these advances, there is still a need for methodological and analytical approaches to complement the aforementioned. This commentary calls on epidemiologists and other health researchers at-large to engage the discourse on measuring structural racism. First, we address the conflation between race and racism in epidemiological research. Next, we offer methodological recommendations (linking of interdisciplinary variables and datasets and leveraging mixed-method and life course approaches) and analytical recommendations (integration of mixed data, use of multidimensional models) that epidemiologists and other health researchers may consider in health equity research. The goal of this commentary is to inspire the use of up-to-date and theoretically-driven approaches to increase discourse amongst public health researchers on capturing racism as well as to improve evidence of its role as the fundamental cause of racial health inequities.",American Journal of Epidemiology,2021.0,0,65,2,False,The goal of this commentary is to inspire the use of up-to-date and theoretically-driven approaches to increase discourse amongst public health researchers on capturing racism as well as to improve evidence of its role as the fundamental cause of racial health inequities.,,,,,1525,1412674554,P.

Instead, the contributing factors of user well-being will be located in environing social, cultural, and political conditions far beyond the control of individual users alone.

1527,Stand Up and Speak Up: Effectiveness of Web-Based Bystander Intervention on a College Campus,"The goal of bystander intervention is to provide college students with the necessary means to recognize an assaultive situation and gain the confidence to step in. The current study examined the effectiveness of a web-based bystander intervention by measuring 28 participants’ outcomes (Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale, Bystander Efficacy Scale, and a confidence in bystander intervention scale) before and after the intervention. The results were compared to a control group receiving statements about sexual assault and to existing data collected from the bystander workshop Stand Up Titans!, conducted through the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Women’s Center during the 2014–2015 academic year. Contrary to expectations, there was no difference in Rape Myth Acceptance scores or Bystander Efficacy scores between the experimental (web-based video) and control (reading passages) groups. Watching the web-based intervention did increase participants’ confidence in intervening compared to the control group, however. As expected, there was a difference in Rape Myth Acceptance (RMA) scores between the web-based intervention group and the Stand Up Titans! workshop, with participants in the workshop reporting a lower Rape Myth Acceptance (i.e., lower endorsement of harmful rape myths). The web-based intervention group and the workshop both had high rates of confidence in intervening. Together, these findings suggest that web-based interventions may be effective at improving bystander confidence but may not reduce rape myths to a greater extent than merely reading statistics about sexual assault. Findings from this study have implications for the use of web-based bystander interventions on college campuses. Page 9 Oshkosh Scholar Introduction Students in college are at a greater risk of sexual assault compared to same-age peers outside of college (National Sexual Violence Resource Center 2015). Changing attitudes are important in order to change unwanted sexual experiences of both men and women (Banyard, Moynihan, and Plante 2007). Bystander-intervention workshops are effective in altering the attitudes of college students as well as informing students about how to help prevent sexual violence and gain confidence in their ability to intervene in assaultive situations. Many bystander interventions are designed to change sexual assault-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. For example, one measure designed to assess knowledge and attitudes is the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (Payne, Lonsway, and Fitzgerald 1999). Rape myths are beliefs that are not true about rape and include instances where, if women dress provocatively, for example, they are asking to be raped or where, if a man is drunk, he might rape someone unintentionally. Rape myth beliefs are important in shaping bystander attitudes toward sexual violence (McMahon 2010). If people have lower acceptance of rape myths then they are more likely to intervene because they are less accepting of rape culture and less tolerant of assaultive behaviors (Egan and Wilson 2012; Foubert and Marriott 1997). A construct related to a person’s behavior is bystander efficacy. According to Ahn et al., “Self-efficacy is the belief held by individuals that they can successfully carry out the actions required for achieving a desired outcome” (2016). Bystander efficacy scales often ask students to consider various situations and then report how likely the students would be to intervene in assaultive situations and their level of confidence in intervention (Banyard et al. 2005). Rape myth acceptance, low perceived bystander efficacy, and low confidence in intervening are all important to address during bystander interventions because they are perceived barriers to intervention (Bennett, Banyard, and Garnhart 2014); they have the potential to hold bystanders back from intervening. Examining these barriers to intervention can therefore increase actual helping behavior (Bennett et al. 2014). Many studies have attempted to examine the effectiveness of bystander interventions in changing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. A study conducted by Banyard et al. (2007) focused on sexual violence prevention through two different in-person bystander workshops. Students participated in either a one-session 90-minute program, or a program consisting of three 90-minute sessions. The experimenters assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of the participants before and after they received the intervention. The results showed that the longer the bystander intervention, the more significant the changes in behavior, knowledge, and attitudes. However, they noted that if there were time constraints, shorter intervention programs could still create important changes. Coker et al. (2011) conducted a study at the University of Kentucky where they evaluated a bystander intervention program called GreenDot. GreenDot is a web-based video program used on college campuses throughout the United States. The participants were split into four groups that received different amounts of training that varied by time and extent. Compared to those who received less training, those who had the most training (both quantity and depth) were more likely to intervene or report actual bystander behaviors (e.g., got help and resources for a friend who said she or he was raped) following participation in the web-based program. However, consistent with Page 10 Oshkosh Scholar the results found by Banyard et al. (2007), receiving any type of intervention, even if minimal, resulted in more active bystander behaviors than no intervention at all. Another bystander intervention program used on college campuses is the Men’s Project, which seeks to train men as women’s allies against sexual violence toward women (Stewart 2014). It requires college men to participate in an 11-week, in-person workshop that explores sexual assault topics. Some of the topics include male privilege, sexuality, gender socialization, sexual violence, emotional and psychological impacts on sexual assault survivors, and bystander interventions. In an evaluation of this program, results demonstrated that the participants showed a decrease in rape myth acceptance and sexism, and reported an increase in feminist activism, action willingness, and bystander efficacy in comparison to control group participants who did not receive any type of intervention (Stewart 2014). This program targets men because previous studies such as Anderson and Whiston (2005) and Foubert and Marriott (1997) found that women generally already have lower rape myth acceptance and less endorsement of sexist beliefs compared to men. A step further in bystander intervention research was a study conducted by Senn and Forrest (2015). They worked to integrate bystander education into an undergraduate curriculum by providing an in-person class that consisted of bystander intervention content. A baseline survey measured students’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. They then took online surveys at three points during the course, which measured efficacy, readiness to change, intentions, and perceived barriers to intervention. Positive changes occurred in both men and women college students when bystander interventions were incorporated into undergraduate curriculum. Students were more confident and showed more readiness to intervene for friends and strangers compared to the control group participants who did not receive an intervention (Senn and Forrest 2015). While effective, long-term in-person interventions like the Men’s Project can be costly. College campuses are now beginning to look for alternative and more cost efficient ways to provide their students with intervention strategies, including shorter, web-based interventions like GreenDot. As stated above, the longer and more in-depth the intervention the more effective it is, but receiving shorter bystander interventions on sexual assault may still have an important impact on reducing rates of sexual violence. Research suggests that introducing college students to the topic of bystander interventions can be enough to get them thinking about how they can help. Long-term web-based interventions can be effective just like the long-term in-person interventions. For example, Salazar et al. (2014) tested the effectiveness of a web-based bystander approach called RealConsent. This bystander approach was designed to enhance prosocial intervening behaviors and prevent sexual violence perpetration. The participants engaged in six, “30-minute interactive modules covering topics like informed consent, communication skills regarding sex, the role of alcohol and male socialization in sexual violence, empathy for rape victims, and bystander education” (Salazar et al. 2014). The results at the six month follow up indicated that participants intervened more, engaged in less sexual violence perpetration, showed knowledge of effective consent, held fewer rape myths, showed greater empathy toward rape victims, and had greater intentions to intervene in comparison to control group participants who watched 30-minute modules from a general health promotion Page 11 Oshkosh Scholar program. The authors argued that RealConsent has the potential to increase the overall impact on sexual violence (Salazar et al. 2014). Current Study Although the results of previous studies on short web-based interventions are encouraging, more interventions are needed. In addition, the shorter web-based interventions have not been directly compared to the longer, more comprehensive, in-person workshops. The current study examined the effectiveness of a one-hour web-based intervention by comparing it to a control group (experimental design) and a previously conducted in-person workshop (non-experimental design). Participants in the experimental study were randomly assigned to watch the web-based interaction (intervention) or read passages about sexual violence (control).

1528,Let's talk: The impact of gendered racial socialization on Black adolescent girls' mental health.,"OBJECTIVE
For Black adolescent girls to develop a healthy sense of self, families must prepare them to cope with the realities of experiencing oppression at the nexus of racism and sexism. In this study, we examined the associations of positive and negative gendered racial socialization with mental health outcomes for Black adolescent girls.


METHOD
To test the hypothesis that socialization messages of gendered racial pride and empowerment (GRPE) moderate the relationship between messages of internalized gendered racial oppression (IGRO) and indicators of psychological well-being (i.e., depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms), a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted based on the experiences of 282 Black adolescent girls (Mage = 15.40).


RESULTS
Findings show that more frequent messages of IGRO were associated with more depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in Black girls. Findings also suggest that more frequent messages of GRPE reduce the negative associations between messages of IGRO and Black adolescent girls' mental health symptoms to attenuation.


CONCLUSIONS
Mental health symptoms in Black girls are able to be moderated by parents' intentional messaging of GRPE. These findings may provide a strategy to protect Black youth from the deleterious consequences of negative messages around race and gender. Future studies may wish to examine the impact of socialization messages of GRPE and IGRO on Black boys' mental health symptoms.

We study the performance of the resulting models in various transfer-learning settings including zero-shot transfer. We also compare our models with those obtained via large-scale self-supervised learning. We find our weakly-supervised models to be very competitive across all settings, and find they substantially outperform their self-supervised counterparts. We also include an investigation into whether our models learned potentially troubling associations or stereotypes.

A manual checking procedure together with a word-based heuristic was used to identify whether an article related to women or men. The heuristic includes explicit mentions of women and men, implicit mentions, and a set of gender-focused health issues and medical terminology. Based on the results, more published articles now relate to women than to men. Moreover, more than twice as many articles relate exclusively to women than exclusively to men, with the ratio increasing from 2.16 to 1 in 1996 to 2.25 to 1 in 2020. Monogender articles mostly addressed primarily female health issues (maternity, breast cancer, cervical cancer) with fewer about primarily male health issues (testicular cancer, pancreatic cancer, health needs of men who have sex with men). Some articles also explicitly addressed gender inequality, such as empowering female entrepreneurs. The findings suggest that the androcentrism of early science has eroded in terms of research topics. This apparent progress should be encouraging for women researchers and society.",Quantitative Science Studies,2021.0,95,3,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'mit.edu', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/3/1/244/108658'}]","M Thelwall, A Abdullah, R Fairclough - Quantitative Science Studies, 2022 - direct.mit.edu","[{'name': 'M Thelwall', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8jCKL1sAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=8jCKL1sAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '8jCKL1sAAAAJ'}]",1531,1701298,M.

1534,Contribution of Social Psychology Research to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Bibliometric and Content Analysis of Spanish Publications,"Abstract This study analyses the publications by Spanish institutions indexed by the Web of Science in the thematic category of “Psychology, Social”. The objectives are to determine whether such publications address topics related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to what extent the research conducted contributes to achieving the goals proposed in each of the SDGs. Publications were classified by their relationship with the SDGs using OSDG tool, and an in-depth content analysis was performed to validate the results. A corpus of 1,632 papers published by Spanish institutions was identified. The results show that 34% percent of the papers address matters related to the SDGs; 23% of these are related to Goal 3 (good health and well-being), and 5%, to Goal 5 (gender equality). For achieving SDG 3 goals, the reviewed papers evidence the need that institutions, governments and society to provide, especially for children and adolescents, healthy social environments to prevent harmful social relationships while improving individual skills to manage emotions in everyday life and promoting cultural integration. Regarding SDG 5, it should be a priority the application of effective strategies to change stereotypes, assigned sexual roles and sexist attitudes that sustain inequality and violence against women.",The Spanish Journal of Psychology,2022.0,73,1,0,True,,,,"…, D De Filippo, A Blanco, ML Lascurain - The Spanish Journal of …, 2022 - cambridge.org","[{'name': 'D De Filippo', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-0x-GxsAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=-0x-GxsAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '-0x-GxsAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'ML Lascurain', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0jqw9ggAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0jqw9ggAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '0jqw9ggAAAAJ'}]",1534,144206187,F.

This instrument has been shown to be useful in detecting the potential lack of awareness about the situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) people among psychology professionals and its possible relationship to contemporary homonegative attitudes. The 596 heterosexual psychology students who participated were given an adaptation into Spanish (back translation). A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to study the fit to the factorial structure of the original scale (aversive heterosexism, institutional heterosexism, and heterosexual privilege). The internal consistency of the subscales was adequate (.70-.83). The convergent validity showed positive correlations and significant predictive levels between the EASOS and various attitudinal scales and sociodemographic variables. The findings offer evidence that the EASOS is an adequate instrument to evaluate LGBQ-negativity, particularly in the field of psychosocial intervention.",Journal of Homosexuality,2021.0,66,4,0,False,"An instrumental study to validate the adaptation of the Evasive Attitudes of Sexual Orientation Scale to Spanish offers evidence that the EASOS is an adequate instrument to evaluate LGBQ-negativity, particularly in the field of psychosocial intervention.",,,,,1536,1484246801,Miguel Ángel López-Sáez,1485812833,Dau García-Dauder,51162538,Ignacio Montero,114448207,Ó.

1541,Dosing Discrimination: Regulating PDMP Risk Scores,"Imagine the following scenario. You are a thirty-year-old Army veteran. While in the service, you were the victim of a horrific sexual assault and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Your military health care provider (HCP) prescribes a low dose sedative “PRN” (take as needed) to mitigate your PTSD symptoms. 
 
Several years later, you are diagnosed with a painful and debilitating inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD), which significantly diminishes your daily functioning without treatment. Your military HCP prescribes you hydrocodone, which allows you to manage your IBD symptoms. As your condition deteriorates, you decide to retire from the military and seek treatment at a civilian clinic. 
 
At first, your new HCP continues your prescription drug treatment regimen. A few months later, however, that HCP informs you that (1) she is under U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigation due to her state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data, (2) you have been flagged by the PDMP as at risk for opioid misuse, and (3) she has no choice but to discontinue your medication. You try to no avail to find another HCP before you lapse into opioid withdrawal and are riddled with severe IBD symptoms. Within a week of your medication discontinuation, you are bedridden, unable to work or take care of your family, severely depressed, and experiencing suicidal ideation. This article exposes and critiques the laws and policies that collude to coerce this scenario and identifies and examines a regulatory oversight framework that can mitigate such needless pain and suffering. 
 
The American drug overdose crisis and generous funding by U.S. law enforcement agencies have provoked forty-nine states to implement PDMP surveillance programs. PDMP platforms rely on proprietary, predictive algorithmic tools designed and manufactured by a private company to determine a patient’s risk for drug misuse. Law enforcement conducts dragnet sweeps of PDMP data to target providers that the platform characterizes as “overprescribers” and patients that it deems as high risk of drug diversion, misuse, and overdose. Research demonstrates that PDMP risk scoring coerces clinicians to force taper, discontinue, and even abandon vulnerable patients without regard for the catastrophic collateral consequences that attend to those treatment decisions. 
 
The proxies that PDMPs utilize to generate patient risk scores are likely to produce artificially inflated risk scores for vulnerable patients. PDMPs, therefore, have the potential to exacerbate discrimination against vulnerable patients with stigmatized medical conditions by generating flawed, short-cut assessment tools that incentivize providers to deny these individuals indicated treatment. The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is authorized to regulate PDMP software platforms as medical devices and the agency has recently issued guidance that provides a robust framework for such oversight. This Article contends that FDA is obligated to exercise its regulatory authority over PDMP risk scoring software to ensure that such predictive diagnostic tools are safe and effective for patients.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2021.0,103,6,1,False,"FDA is obligated to exercise regulatory authority over PDMP risk scoring software to ensure that such predictive diagnostic tools are safe and effective for patients, and exposes and critiques the laws and policies that collude to coerce this scenario.",,,,,1541,144134017,J.

1543,"Dating violence, violence in social networks, anxiety and depression in nursing degree students: A cross-sectional study.","AIM
To determine the prevalence and risk factors for dating violence and the correlations between dating violence and violence in social networks, anxiety and depression among nursing students.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional and correlational study.


METHODS
This study was conducted with nursing degree students at Spanish university during May 2021. A total of 248 nursing students completed an online survey. The online survey included sociodemographic variables, the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory, the Social Network Violence Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Chi-squared test, Pearson's correlation and logistic regression were used.


RESULTS
Of the participants, 13.3% were men and 86.7% were women. A total of 53.2% had experienced and/or perpetrated dating violence. About violence in social networks, 22.2% of the participants had perpetrated it, and 20.2% had been victims of it. Strong correlations were found between experiencing and perpetrating dating violence. Significant associated factors were cohabitation with a partner, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic status and history of dating violence.


CONCLUSIONS
Dating violence is a serious problem given its high prevalence among the surveyed nursing students, who, as future health professionals, must know how to recognize and react to possible cases of abuse.


IMPACT
The study results add to international literature that men and women university nursing students are equally susceptible to intimate partner violence and report similar prevalence of dating violence. Also, dating violence is correlated with increased levels of anxiety and depression.

1545,“You Don’t Know Me so Don’t Try to Judge Me”: Gender and Identity Performance on Social Media Among Young Indian Users,"Social media is the preferred communication platform for today’s youth, yet little is known of how online intergender communication is shaped by social identity norms. Drawing from the Social Identity and Deindividuation Effects (SIDE) approach, we argue that through depersonalization, online interactions are marked by the salience of social identities and identity performance conforming to perceived norms of behavior (traditional as well as developing). We specifically look at discursive terms and their meaning-making as a strategic performance of gender in uncontrolled social media interactions. We examined a corpus of 442 comments from selected public Indian Facebook pages in two phases over a span of 1 year (2020–2021). Thematic discourse analysis revealed established (#mansplaining, pseudofeminism) and emerging (choice feminism, MGTOW, #fuckboi etc.) discursive strategies within the major themes on feminism and antifeminism, men’s rights, intersectional feminism, and sexual behavior. These meaningful terms are used to modulate identity performance in a heavily contested space, reflecting both consolidation as well as mobilization functions, as proposed by SIDE. The findings highlight that intergender communication on social media is both dependent on existing offline norms, while challenging the same to create new discourses of gender.",Frontiers in Psychology,2022.0,148,0,0,True,,,,,,1545,87030255,Sramana Majumdar,2024422657,M.

1546,"Racial discrimination, mental health symptoms, and intimate partner violence perpetration in Black adults.","OBJECTIVE
This study had three goals: (a) to examine the association between racial discrimination and intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration; (b) to determine whether this relationship is explained by mental health (MH) symptoms; and (c) to determine whether these associations vary by poverty status or gender.


METHODS
During the Wave 4 (2013-2017) visit of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Longitudinal Study (HANDLS), Black adults who were in a relationship (N = 433; mean age = 55.26, SD = 9.30; 51% men) provided self-report data on IPV perpetration; frequency of racial discrimination; and levels of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Multigroup mediation models used these cross-sectional data to test whether racial discrimination was associated with MH symptoms, which in turn were associated with IPV perpetration, determining the significance of direct and indirect pathways and whether any pathways varied by poverty status or gender.


RESULTS
Racial discrimination was associated with more MH symptoms, which in turn was associated with IPV perpetration. The negative effect of discrimination on MH was stronger for Black women than Black men and for Black adults with household incomes below 125% of the Federal poverty line than those with incomes above this cutoff.


DISCUSSION
Efforts to prevent and treat IPV in the Black community should address the negative effects of racial discrimination experiences on MH and partner aggression, especially among those with multiple marginalized identities. IPV prevention efforts may be enhanced through an overarching commitment to dismantle structural racism and intersectional forms of oppression.

1549,Creating and Sustaining Service Industry Relationships and Families: Theorizing How Personal Workplace Relationships Both Build Community and Perpetuate Organizational Violence,"Service industry workers experience challenging labor conditions in the United States, including pay below the minimum wage, expected emotional labor, and harassment. Additionally, in part because they work long shifts in high stress environments in restaurants and bars, many build and form personal workplace relationships (PWRs). In 2021, we interviewed 38 service industry workers and managers during the COVID-19 pandemic where we examined occupational challenges they faced in the state of Texas, USA. Through our interpretive research, this essay showcases our inductive findings on how service industry workers and managers utilize communication to create and sustain PWRs. We identified how some PWRs are sustained through a unique form of occupational identification that cultivates a “service industry family”, which we term familial personal workplace relationships (familial PWRs). This extends past organizational communication scholarship on family to consider occupational identification. Furthermore, our research reveals that while PWRs may build communities through care and support, they also perpetuate organizational violence, like sexual harassment and bullying.",Behavioral Science,2022.0,72,0,0,True,,,,,,1549,103529342,E.

1550,Professionals’ Views on the Comparatively Low Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Spain,"The aim of this study was to understand the reasons why Spain has one of the lowest prevalence rates of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) in the European Union. Using a qualitative and inductive research approach, a total of five focus groups (n = 19) and 10 unstructured interviews with key informants were conducted. Three main categories were identified as possible explanations of the relatively low prevalence of IPVAW in Spain: law and policy, social awareness, and cultural patterns.

1551,Social Simulacra: Creating Populated Prototypes for Social Computing Systems,"Social computing prototypes probe the social behaviors that may arise in an envisioned system design. This prototyping practice is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input the designer’s description of a community’s design—goal, rules, and member personas—and produce as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of “what if?” scenarios where community members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the observation that large language models’ training data already includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine their social computing designs when using social simulacra.",ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology,2022.0,87,7,0,True,"It is demonstrated that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of “what if?” scenarios where community members or moderators intervene.",,"[{'title': 'arxiv.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04024'}]","JS Park, L Popowski, CJ Cai, MR Morris… - arXiv preprint arXiv …, 2022 - arxiv.org","[{'name': 'JS Park', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y4Oc0cMAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Y4Oc0cMAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Y4Oc0cMAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'L Popowski', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ef6K7mQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=Ef6K7mQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'Ef6K7mQAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'CJ Cai', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cMgNn94AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=cMgNn94AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'cMgNn94AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'MR Morris', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eJsW6W8AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=eJsW6W8AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'eJsW6W8AAAAJ'}]",1551,2116649486,J.

1552,The Effects of Humorous Posts on Twitter during a Time of Uncertainty: The Case of Kuwait during the Coronavirus Pandemic,"ABSTRACT This study examines the effects of humorous posts on Twitter during an uncertain time, such as the Coronavirus pandemic, which brought panic globally. In Kuwait, many Twitter users have posted humorous tweets about the Coronavirus to influence the public’s understanding of the pandemic and exert pressure on government to take measures to stop the spread of the disease. However, the impact of many of humorous tweets was indirect and negative, causing panic and division among social groups. An online survey was employed to examine the effects of humorous Twitter messages on understanding the pandemic, causing hatred toward others and augmenting a sense of negative emotion in society. The response of 1,031 to the survey indicated that humor increased negative emotional reactions and increased understanding of the pandemic. There was no link between Twitter humor and hatred of others.

1553,Latinx trans immigrants’ survival of torture in U.S. detention: A qualitative investigation of the psychological impact of abuse and mistreatment,"Abstract Background: A trans person is murdered every 3 days in the world, with the majority of these murders occurring in Latin America. This violence is a motivating factor for Latinx trans immigrants to immigrate to the United States. Regardless of whether individuals may be able to remain in the U.S., trans immigrants and asylum seekers are often held in detention facilities until immigration courts decide their cases. Although there are several standards of care and guidelines produced for trans and nonbinary (TNB) people who are held in detention, various reports have indicated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has not or inappropriately implemented these guidelines, thereby incurring and increasing risk of harm upon TNB immigrants. Aims: This qualitative study used thematic analysis to provide an understanding of the psychological impact that the systemic power of US detention proceedings had on the lives of Latinx, trans immigrants. Method: The semi-structured interview protocol and implementation of this study was developed in collaboration with two national Latinx, LGBTQ immigrant advocacy organizations. The sample included 30 trans participants, between the ages of 18 and 52 (M = 23) who immigrated from El Salvador (40%), Guatemala (23%), México (17%), Honduras (17%), and Peru (3%). Results: Participants reported being subject to debilitating and torturous conditions in “La Hielera”, torture and abusive treatment by detention authorities, being denied access to basic human needs and medical care, and held in solitary confinement as punishment. This dehumanization, abuse, and transphobia in detention incurred psychological sequelae on participants including trauma, anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation, and a preference to self-deport. Discussion: Implications include calls to abolish immigration detention, recommendations for mental health providers, and an overall restructuring of policies and services for humane asylum seeking processes for trans, Latinx immigrants.",International Journal of Transgender Health,2021.0,89,3,0,False,,,,,,1553,8612015,Laura P.

1554,Surviving the Landings: An Autoethnographic Account of Being a Gay Female Prison Officer (in an Adult Male Prison in England),"Abstract Female correctional staff face multiple challenges when working in a male prison environment. Perceptions of competence and gendered divisions of labor are prevalent in the negotiated order of a prison. Sexuality is a dynamic that is irrelevant to the demands of a correctional officer yet a significant identity to be managed and negotiated in interactions with both colleagues and prisoners. This study adopts an auto ethnographic approach to highlight discrimination in prison officer occupational culture. Drawing upon personal narratives whilst working in an adult male prison in England, lived experiences of homophobia and sexism are presented to identify the challenges faced as a gay female prison officer.

1555,Exposure to Childhood Healthcare Discrimination and Healthcare Avoidance among Transgender and Gender Independent Adults during a Global Pandemic,"Transgender and gender-independent individuals (TGI) encounter myriad barriers to accessing affirming healthcare. Healthcare discrimination and erasure exposure among TGI individuals is vital to understanding healthcare accessibility, utilization behaviors, and health disparities in this population. Exposure to gender identity-related healthcare discrimination and erasure in childhood may contribute to TGI adults’ healthcare utilization behaviors. The commonality of childhood exposure to gender identity-related healthcare discrimination and its relationship to healthcare avoidance during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic among TGI adults were explored. TGI adults aged 18 to 59 (N = 342) in the United States were recruited online during the summer of 2020. Among individuals who reported childhood exposure to gender identity-related healthcare discrimination, 51% reported experiencing two or more distinct forms of discrimination. Hierarchical logistic regression indicated that exposure to healthcare discrimination in childhood significantly increased the odds of healthcare avoidance during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, after accounting for demographic factors and self-reported COVID-19 symptoms (odds ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval = 1.10, 1.54).

1556,Challenging the Myth of “Attention Seeking” Women with Suicidality: A Grounded Theory Study about Applying Counter-Pressure to Manage System Entrapment,"Abstract Some women who express suicidal intent and engage in non-lethal self-harm perceive that nurses and other health care workers label them as attention-seeking and manipulative. An understanding of women’s help-seeking behaviors that challenges suicide myths is presented. The purpose of this study was to examine help-seeking for suicidality in women with histories of intimate partner violence using a multiple qualitative research design of grounded theory and photovoice. Women from New Brunswick, Canada, over the age of 19 who left an abusive partner (n = 32) were interviewed and seven local women from this sample participated in five photovoice group sessions where they collectively examined self-generated photos of their experiences. Transcripts of the interviews and group sessions were analyzed using the constant comparative approach, yielding a theoretical rendering of women’s help seeking. Results include a process of Applying Counter-Pressure as a way of pushing back against System Entrapment, or the sense of being invalidated and dehumanized by health care providers with the goal to Feel Human. Findings provide an understanding of women’s behavior when seeking help for suicidality and may reduce nurses’ assumptions and judgments when providing care.

1557,Role-Based Framing of Older Adults Linked to Decreased Ageism Over 210 Years: Evidence From a 600-Million-Word Historical Corpus,"Abstract Background and Objectives Older adults are exhibiting greater diversity in their aging trajectories. This has led to movements by the World Health Organization and AARP to reframe aging. We compare role-based framing and age-based framing of older adults over 210 years—a time span beyond the reach of traditional methods—and elucidate their respective sentiments and narratives. Research Design and Methods We combined the Corpus of Historical American English with the Corpus of Contemporary American English to create a 600-million-word data set—the largest historical corpus of American English with over 150,000 texts collected from newspapers, magazines, fiction, and nonfiction. We compiled the top descriptors of age-based terms (e.g., senior citizen) and role-based terms (e.g., grandparent) and rated them for stereotypic valence (negative to positive) over 21 decades. Results Age-based framing evidenced a significantly higher increase in negativity (15%) compared to role-based framing (4%). We found a significant interaction effect between framing (age-based vs. role-based) and stereotypic content across 2 centuries (1800s and 1900s). The percentage of positive topics associated with role-based framing increased from 71% in the 1800s to 89% in the 1900s, with narratives of affection and wisdom becoming more prevalent. Conversely, the percentage of positive topics for age-based framing decreased from 82% to 38% over time, with narratives of burden, illness, and death growing more prevalent.

1558,Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse,"All stripes of feminists need to read this book, which is written lucidly, compellingly, and in a narrative style that accommodates intellectual analysis. Whether readers agree or disagree with her arguments, they will have to acknowledge that Messer-Davidow writes with feminist passion. As a participant-activist in the earliest years of the second wave of feminism and as a graduate student involved in community and campus activism, she took part in the new feminist caucus at the Modern Language Association (MLA) and spent two years as an administrative assistant to her university president as he tried to make institutional change happen. Having taken part in the feminist determination to change the elitist ways of the academy and transform its disciplines, she asks, ""[HI ow did it happen that a bold venture launched thirty years ago to transform academic and social institutions was itself transformed by them?"" (1). Messer-Davidow believes that proponents of ""feminist studies"" (the term she uses throughout) started out to bridge the academy-community divide but ultimately failed because their efforts to secure a place in the academy ultimately subjected them to the rules of exclusivity and inequality that govern universities. Seeing feminist studies as increasingly ""formatted as an academic discipline"" (13), she concludes that its initial political agenda for social change has been lost. Academic feminists read, teach, do research, and write about social activism, she laments, but they no longer do it. Part I provides a sharply etched picture of how the disciplines historically edged out women who were not seen to ""fit in"" to their disciplinary order. It then explores the universities' defense of their traditional exclusionary practices of sex-discrimination. Part 2 shows that despite the growth of feminist studies, in terms of thousands of courses and hundreds of programs, the wage gap for women faculty persists. They remain clustered in lower prestige disciplines, lower prestige institutions, lower faculty ranks, and part-time positions. Feminist efforts have led to curriculum transformation projects, the establishment of campus-based feminist research centers, a national association of feminist scholars, and women's caucuses in every disciplinary association. Yet increased numbers of women faculty and women students have had no radical effect. Feminist presses and conferences have only made it easier for mainstream disciplinary arenas to resist and ignore feminist scholarship and to keep feminist studies marginal. Maintained on scant budgets and usually restricted to offering only introductory and senior courses, programs have had to rely on discipline-approved crosslisted courses over which they have minimal control. Instead of sponsoring outreach into the community, feminists in the academy at best only teach about such issues. Only feminist theory, which continues to expand, remains truly interdisciplinary. But, in Messer-Davidow's words, feminist theory only generates ""streams of knowledge particularized according to their identity, disciplinary, and/or political positions"" (212). On top of this, the challenges of poststructuralism have further reduced social change to the ""workings of signification"" (213). In Part 3, Messer-Davidow compares feminist social change efforts with those of the new conservative movement that has grown steadily in America. Well-funded, professionally managed, and using all the services of modern information technology, conservative organizations by the 1990s had formed tightly networked lines of communication at the national level, offering summer leadership institutes to train the next generation of young conservatives for future roles in government and media work. The nearest feminist equivalent Messer-Davidow found was a statewide curriculum integration effort, the New Jersey Project, but it focused on the higher education sector within one state. The better-funded conservative organizations have sought to inculcate a fairly homogeneous set of male and female students from all over the country with an appreciation of the ""superiority of the American system"" (240). …",,2002.0,0,67,5,False,,,,,,1558,104724842,Dorothy O.

1559,"Social media’s commodified, transgender ambassador: Caitlyn Jenner, celebrity activism, and social media","ABSTRACT American Olympic athlete and former reality television star Caitlyn Jenner remains a polarising figure in discussions of celebrity culture, transgender visibility, and social activism due to her conservative political views and limited knowledge about the issues non-famous transgender people face in society. Since reintroducing herself as a transgender woman in 2015, Jenner has been framed as a figurehead for transgender activism in mass media due to her avowed intention to disrupt transphobia and Twitter commentary on politics, and equally accused of commodifying her transgender experience for economic gain. Given the many questions surrounding the legitimacy of Jenner’s transgender advocacy and her intentional use of Twitter as a medium to discuss transgender politics, this research conducted a textual analysis of Jenner’s Twitter account, @Caitlyn_Jenner to examine how the transgender celebrity used social media to discuss her lived experiences as a transgender woman and advocate on behalf of the transgender community. The findings supported prior scholarly criticisms of Jenner’s celebrity image, online celebrity activism, and transwomen’s representations in celebrity culture. @Caitlyn_Jenner fostered online social connections and discussions with her transgender followers. However, Jenner did not facilitate any collective social movement actions due to her ideological differences with Republican and transgender communities.",Celebrity Studies,2020.0,93,2,0,False,,,,,,1559,1450262950,Melvin L.

1561,"Feeling safe and content: Relationship to internalized sexual stigma, self-awareness, and identity uncertainty in Italian lesbian and bisexual women","Abstract Research has linked feelings of safety and contentment to lower adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) in the general population. The current study aimed at exploring the relationship between safe/content positive affect and minority stress (e.g., internalized sexual stigma) in lesbian and bisexual women, considering the effect of potential mediators such as identity self-awareness and identity uncertainty. An online survey was administered to 400 Italian women (220 lesbian and 180 bisexual women), aged 18–40 years (M = 25.98, SD = 6.07). The results showed that lesbian women reported lower internalized sexual stigma and identity uncertainty and higher safe/content positive affect and identity self-awareness, relative to bisexual women. Higher internalized sexual stigma predicted lower safe/content positive affect, regardless of sexual orientation. Furthermore, identity self-awareness and identity uncertainty significantly mediated the relationship between internalized sexual stigma and safe/content feelings, thus confirming the protective role of sexual identity variables on lesbian and bisexual women’s positive affectivity. Finally, univariate analyses suggested that lesbian women were more resilient than bisexual women in the face of minority stressors. The results contribute to the understanding of the differences between lesbian and bisexual women in their perception of salient identity categories. In addition, the findings highlight the relevance of protective factors (e.g., identity certainty, lesbian and bisexual positive identity) in ameliorating the adverse effects of minority stress and promoting positive affect and social adjustment in lesbian and bisexual women.

1563,Is labour market discrimination against ethnic minorities better explained by taste or statistics? A systematic review of the empirical evidence,"ABSTRACT To mitigate ethnic labour market discrimination, it is essential to understand its underlying mechanisms because different mechanisms call for different counteracting measures. To this end, we reviewed the recent literature that confronts the theories of taste-based and statistical discrimination against the empirical reality. Whereas the empirical evidence for both mechanisms is generally mixed, (field) experimental research, which predominantly focuses on hiring outcomes, appears to yield proportionately more evidence in favour of taste-based discrimination vis-à-vis statistical discrimination. This finding suggests that the taste-based mechanism may better explain ethnic discrimination in hiring. However, we also observe that the measurement operationalisations of the mechanisms vary substantially between studies and that alternative theoretical interpretations of some of the evidence are plausible. Taken together, additional research efforts, using clear measurement standards and appropriate synthesis methods, are required to solidify the review’s main finding.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2022.0,138,13,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'tandfonline.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1369183X.2022.2050191'}]","L Lippens, S Baert, A Ghekiere… - Journal of Ethnic and …, 2022 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'L Lippens', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N5hW-KgAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=N5hW-KgAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'N5hW-KgAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'S Baert', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zce2fVcAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=zce2fVcAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'zce2fVcAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'A Ghekiere', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6HTvKdcAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=6HTvKdcAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '6HTvKdcAAAAJ'}]",1563,1671338359,Louis Lippens,5461135,S.

1565,A Rainbow For Reading: A Mixed-Methods Exploratory Study On Drag Queen Reading Programs,"ABSTRACT This exploratory mixed-methods study sought to understand some of the potential psychoeducational benefits of drag queen reading programs. A short mixed-methods survey was employed that asked caregivers about their experiences with drag queen reading programs. Since this is a topic with little prior research, ethnographic observations of three different drag queen reading programs were also completed to gain more knowledge of the public realm of a modality that challenges cisheteronormativity of gender expression. Over 86% of the respondents enjoyed the program and would recommend it to a friend. A majority of respondents (72%) shared that their children enjoyed the programming, and a little more than half (65%) felt like it was age appropriate. The qualitative results suggest that storytimes may be more effective if they cater to a specific developmental range (such as for all ages, toddlers and infants, and school-aged children).

1566,Asian American people's intragroup and intergroup collective action: Identifying key correlates.,"The present study advanced prior research by examining key correlates of Asian American people's intragroup and intergroup collective action. Building on prior research, this study tested a model of the unique relations of experiences of discrimination, model minority beliefs, intragroup solidarity, and intergroup solidarity with other people of color as correlates of Asian American people's intragroup and intergroup collective action. Single-indicator latent variable path analysis explained 59% and 44% of the variance in intergroup collective action and intragroup collective action, respectively. Experiences of discrimination had a significant unique positive link with both intragroup collective action and intergroup collective action. Model minority achievement orientation beliefs had a significant unique negative link with both intragroup collective action and intergroup collective action. Model minority unrestricted mobility beliefs did not have a significant unique link with either intragroup collective action or intergroup collective action. Intragroup solidarity had a significant unique positive direct link with intragroup collective action, but no unique significant link with intergroup collective action. Intergroup solidarity had a significant unique positive direct link with both intergroup collective action and intragroup collective action. These findings reveal potential points of intervention to foster Asian American people's engagement in intergroup and intragroup collective action.

1567,Toward interventions to reduce internalized ageism,"ABSTRACT Ageism is an insidious form of injustice that is internalized from an early age with accumulating negative health impacts across the lifespan. Internalized ageism has been associated with numerous public health outcomes, including physical and mental health, functional impairment, cognition, cardiovascular stress, hospitalizations, and longevity. Research has begun to document how ageism negatively impacts health through psychological, behavioral, and physiological pathways. Yet, limited research has addressed interventions to reduce internalized ageism. This article draws from stereotype embodiment theory and successful aging, presenting a conceptual model which incorporates potential downstream, midstream, and upstream interventions at micro, meso, and macro levels. The need to examine how policy influences health through the three pathways involved in stereotype embodiment theory is discussed. This study provides a working model for scholars and practitioners to use when considering paths toward reducing internalized ageism and optimizing well-being for aging adults.",Innovation in aging,2021.0,135,2,0,False,,,,"A Steward - Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 2022 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'A Steward', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HjZq1V0AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=HjZq1V0AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'HjZq1V0AAAAJ'}]",1567,2160879487,Andrew Steward,,,,,,,,,,,Psychology,

This work situates Black women and femmes’ experiences within extant social media research, and examines how their unique identity creates multiple forms of interlocking oppression. In our focus groups, participants (N=49) described harms they experienced through racism, misogynoir, ableism, and sexual objectification, and their complex labor of protecting and transforming their experiences online. Despite the harmful effects of unwanted behavior online, participants described a Black feminist transformative politic, in which they cultivated healing and joy through various methods offline and online.

1569,Disparities in the unmet mental health needs between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ populations during COVID-19 in the United States from 21 July 2021 to 9 May 2022,"Background Evidence highlighted the likelihood of unmet mental health needs (UMHNs) among LGBTQ+ than non-LGBTQ+ populations during COVID-19. However, there lacks evidence to accurately answer to what extent the gap was in UMHN between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ populations. We aim to evaluate the difference in UMHN between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ during COVID-19. Methods Cross-sectional data from Household Pulse Survey between 21 July 2021 and 9 May 2022 were analyzed. LGBTQ+ was defined based on self-reported sex at birth, gender, and sexual orientation identity. UMHN was assessed by a self-reported question. Multivariable logistic regressions generated adjusted odds ratios (AODs) of UMHN, both on overall and subgroups, controlling for a variety of socio-demographic and economic-affordability confounders. Findings 81267 LGBTQ+ and 722638 non-LGBTQ+ were studied. The difference in UMHN between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ (as reference) varied from 4.9% (95% CI 1.2–8.7%) in Hawaii to 16.0% (95% CI 12.2–19.7%) in Utah. In multivariable models, compared with non-LGBTQ+ populations, LGBTQ+ had a higher likelihood to report UMHN (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI 2.18–2.39), with the highest likelihood identified in transgender (AOR = 3.63, 95% CI 2.97–4.39); compared with LGBTQ+ aged 65+, LGBTQ+ aged 18–25 had a higher likelihood to report UMHN (AOR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.03–1.75); compared with White LGBTQ+ populations, Black and Hispanic LGBTQ+ had a lower likelihood to report UMHN (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.63–0.82; AOR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.97, respectively). Interpretation During the COVID-19, LGBTQ+ had a substantial additional risk of UMHN than non-LGBTQ+.

1571,Toward a Theory of the Underpinnings and Vulnerabilities of Structural Racism: Looking Upstream from Disease Inequities among People Who Use Drugs,"Structural racism is increasingly recognized as a key driver of health inequities and other adverse outcomes. This paper focuses on structural racism as an “upstream” institutionalized process, how it creates health inequities and how structural racism persists in spite of generations of efforts to end it. So far, “downstream” efforts to reduce these health inequities have had little success in eliminating them. Here, we attempt to increase public health awareness of structural racism and its institutionalization and sociopolitical supports so that research and action can address them. This paper presents both a theoretic and an analytic approach to how structural racism contributes to disproportionate rates of HIV/AIDS and related diseases among oppressed populations. We first discuss differences in disease and health outcomes among people who use drugs (PWUD) and other groups at risk for HIV from different racial and ethnic populations. The paper then briefly analyzes the history of racism; how racial oppression, class, gender and other intersectional divisions interact to create health inequities; and how structural racism is institutionalized in ways that contribute to disease disparities among people who use drugs and other people. It examines the processes, institutions and other structures that reinforce structural racism, and how these, combined with processes that normalize racism, serve as barriers to efforts to counter and dismantle the structural racism that Black, indigenous and Latinx people have confronted for centuries. Finally, we discuss the implications of this analysis for public health research and action to undo racism and to enhance the health of populations who have suffered lifetimes of racial/ethnic oppression, with a focus on HIV/AIDS outcomes.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022.0,198,2,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'mdpi.com', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/12/7453/pdf?version=1655465278'}]","SR Friedman, LD Williams, AE Jordan… - International journal of …, 2022 - mdpi.com","[{'name': 'SR Friedman', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bQwCIGQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=bQwCIGQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'bQwCIGQAAAAJ'}]",1571,35086850,S.

1572,Where Sex Meets Gender: How Sex and Gender Come Together to Cause Sex Differences in Mental Illness,"Sex differences are prevalent in multiple mental disorders. Internalizing disorders are more commonly diagnosed in women, whereas externalizing and neurodevelopmental disorders are more often diagnosed in men. Significant sex/gender differences are reported in prevalence, symptom profile, age of onset, comorbidities, functional impairment, prognosis, as well as in responses to various treatments. In this conceptual article, we discuss theories and empirical studies of sex- and gender-related influences in mental health, by focusing on three examples: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), acknowledged as a disorder whose roots are mainly biological; eating disorders, whose origins are considered to be mainly psychosocial, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an environmentally caused disorder with both psychosocial and biological underpinnings. We examine the ways in which sex differences emerge, from conception through adulthood. We also examine how gender dichotomies in exposures, expectations, role assumptions, and cultural traditions impact the expression of our three selected mental illnesses. We are especially interested in how sex-based influences and gender-based influences interact with one another to affect mental illness. We suggest that sex and gender are multi-faceted and complex phenomena that result in variations, not only between men and women, but also within each sex and gender through alterations in genes, hormone levels, self-perceptions, trauma experiences, and interpersonal relationships. Finally, we propose a conceptual diatheses-stress model, depicting how sex and gender come together to result in multiple sex/gender differences across mental disorders. In our model, we categorize diatheses into several categories: biological, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental. These diatheses interact with exposure to stressors, ranging from relatively minor to traumatic, which allows for the sometimes bidirectional influences of acute and long-term stress responses. Sex and gender are discussed at every level of the model, thereby providing a framework for understanding and predicting sex/gender differences in expression, prevalence and treatment response of mental disorders. We encourage more research into this important field of study.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2022.0,159,6,0,True,,,,,,1572,9536740,D. Christiansen,3729899,M. McCarthy,3234738,M.

1573,Why I Didn’t Report: Reasons for Not Reporting Sexual Violence as Stated on Twitter,"ABSTRACT Though sexual violence is prevalent, formal reporting to police remains uncommon. Social media may provide a unique outlet for survivors of different forms of sexual violence, who might otherwise remain silent. This study examined the viral Twitter #WhyIDidntReport hashtag to synthesize survivors’ reasons for not reporting sexual violence to formal authorities. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on a random sample of 469 tweets. Seven major themes emerged: internal reactions, expectations of negative social reactions, perpetrator factors, myths and knowledge, actual negative reactions from others, protection of others, and concerns about evidence. These themes are largely consistent with more narrowly focused past research, suggesting that social media may continue to offer viable opportunities for unobtrusive research in the future. Additionally, the uniquely broad lens of this study further illuminated stigma as a major barrier for reporting. Future research might test the relative predictive strength of specific barriers.","Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma",2021.0,72,4,0,False,,,,,,1573,47374581,C. M.

Reuse permitted under CC BYNC. No commercial reuse. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the implications of sex and gender differences to human health and wellbeing. Evidence to date indicates that men are at higher risk of severe disease and death than women, while women seem more likely to suffer from longterm COVID-19, and experience negative social and economic impacts. 3 Biological sex as well as gender roles and behaviours can affect exposure to the virus and influence the prevalence of preexisting conditions or harmful habits. Incorporating sex and gender considerations into clinical research on COVID-19 from the outset would help to identify differential patterns of risk, underlying reasons for disparate outcomes and to develop interventions to effectively respond to the various needs of women and men. Given the growing recognition of the relevance of sex and gender in the COVID-19 pandemic, the rationale for this analysis was to examine whether these dimensions are taken into account in clinical research on COVID-19. We carried out a systematic review of COVID-19 research to examine how sex and gender are integrated and reported using the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines recommendations as analytical categories. A PubMed search for interventional and observational trials on COVID19, published from 1 December 2019 to 12 September 2020 resulted in 2066 studies. PubMed was chosen for offering the most comprehensive and uptodate database of clinical studies on COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria were interventional or observational clinical studies the primary objective of which was related to COVID-19. Studies that did not focus on COVID-19 as an endpoint, commentaries, reviews, preprints, case studies and studies that had less than 10 participants were excluded. After screening the titles and abstracts, 1178 articles were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the 888 remaining articles, 816 were observational studies and 72 were interventional trials. Among the 816 observational studies, a 10% sample, that is, 82 articles, was randomly selected. The random selection ensured the representativeness of the sample of the retrieved observational studies, while ensuring a feasible number of papers to review. The full text of the 82 observational studies and the 72 interventional trials was reviewed, and 11 and 17 articles, respectively, were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria, for which the justifications are found in online supplemental material 1. Overall, data were extracted from a total of 126 articles: 55 interventional (five on vaccines, 50 on COVID-19 treatments) and 71 observational studies.

1575,Our past creates our present: a brief overview of racism and colonialism in Western paleontology,"Abstract. As practitioners of a historical science, paleontologists and geoscientists are well versed in the idea that the ability to understand and to anticipate the future relies upon our collective knowledge of the past. Despite this understanding, the fundamental role that the history of paleontology and the geosciences plays in shaping the structure and culture of our disciplines is seldom recognized and therefore not acted upon sufficiently. Here, we present a brief review of the history of paleontology and geology in Western countries, with a particular focus on North America since the 1800s. Western paleontology and geology are intertwined with systematic practices of exclusion, oppression, and erasure that arose from their direct participation in the extraction of geological and biological resources at the expense of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Our collective failure to acknowledge this history hinders our ability to address these issues meaningfully and systemically in present-day educational, academic, and professional settings. By discussing these issues and suggesting some ways forward, we intend to promote a deeper reflection upon our collective history and a broader conversation surrounding racism, colonialism, and exclusion within our scientific communities. Ultimately, it is necessary to listen to members of the communities most impacted by these issues to create actionable steps forward while holding ourselves accountable for the past.",Paleobiology,2021.0,130,13,0,True,,,"[{'title': 'cambridge.org', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/79248D87425C01E9D388DA2EFED92866/S0094837321000282a.pdf/our-past-creates-our-present-a-brief-overview-of-racism-and-colonialism-in-western-paleontology.pdf'}]","PM Monarrez, JB Zimmt, AM Clement, W Gearty… - Paleobiology, 2022 - cambridge.org","[{'name': 'PM Monarrez', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3cDVGn4AAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=3cDVGn4AAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': '3cDVGn4AAAAJ'}, {'name': 'JB Zimmt', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SrwJoowAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=SrwJoowAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'SrwJoowAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'AM Clement', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YKyfiSwAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=YKyfiSwAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'YKyfiSwAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'W Gearty', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HWV1c2UAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=HWV1c2UAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'HWV1c2UAAAAJ'}]",1575,90765475,P.

 Violence against women and children, particularly child sexual abuse (CSA) remains a critical public health, human rights, and humanitarian-related issue in South Africa. The research base is largely under-developed in South Africa, given the intense stigmatisation of CSA, low-disclosure rates and inherent barriers to accessing perpetrators for research purposes. An in-depth qualitative study was conducted with twelve males who had sexually abused children in a therapeutic, rehabilitation programme. Thematic analysis based on two years of recurrent interviews during the therapeutic intervention illustrates their experiences, histories and factors compounding their journeys as victims toward perpetration. We present four themes; Familial abuse and maltreatment; Powerlessness, fear and abandonment; Sexualised lives and sexual abuse experiences; and Powerlessness and lasting impact of exposure to and perpetration of CSA. Findings illustrate unique sex offending trajectories from victimisation to perpetration, particular to the South African context.

1579,Sexual Communication between Adolescent Partners: A Scoping Review and Directions for Future Research,"ABSTRACT Sexual communication between adolescent partners is an important component of sexual health and wellbeing. Over 40 years of research on adolescent sexual communication has yielded rich information, yet there remain gaps in our understanding of the communication process. The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize the body of research on adolescent sexual communication to identify how communication has been conceptualized, how researchers have measured communication, and what theoretical frameworks have been applied across the literature. We identified 198 assessments of sexual communication across 119 quantitative studies. This work included 127,489 adolescents (M age = 15.97) from 15 countries (81.5% U.S.-based). Most studies relied on self-reports (93.4%) and surveyed only one member of a couple (97.5%). The definition of sexual communication was highly varied across the literature: in half of assessments (52.0%) sexual communication was operationalized as a behavior–the verbal or nonverbal exchange of messages about sex–whereas the remaining half of assessments captured social-cognitive aspects of communication (e.g., communication self-efficacy, fear/anxiety). There was also a tendency for investigators to create their own idiosyncratic instruments: half of studies (48.9%) used instruments created by the research team with limited or no discussion of reliability/validity. Regarding the topic of communication, a third of assessments (33.8%) focused exclusively on condom communication and another quarter (24.0%) focused on other safer-sex issues (e.g., STDs, abstinence). Notably absent were studies focused on communication surrounding consent or sexual pleasure. Also absent was a guiding conceptual model or theory that could unify this body of work. Overall, results highlight gaps and inconsistencies in how partner sexual communication has been conceptualized, measured, and theorized about in previous work. We provide several recommendations for future theory-building efforts as well as rigorous, multimethod empirical investigations of adolescent sexual communication that would further our understanding of this important aspect of adolescent sexual wellbeing.",Journal of Sex Research,2022.0,132,1,0,False,,,,,,1579,4856244,L.

Through reflection on the interpersonal dynamics of three critical incidents, we illustrate the interplay of intra-psychic and political aspects of identity--what we have termed 'relational citizenship', an intersubjective self-state in which the individual and the sociopolitical are psychically linked and where the challenges of identifying with and belonging to one or more collectivities are recognized and negotiated.",The International journal of psycho-analysis,2022.0,106,0,0,False,,,,,,1582,74813998,J.

1583,"Stress-Related Growth Among Transgender Women: Measurement, Correlates, and Insights for Clinical Interventions","ABSTRACT Although transgender women (TGW), and especially TGW of color, are disproportionately exposed to discrimination and violence, many of them experience stress-related growth. However, little is known about the experience of stress-related growth and its correlates among TGW. Using data from a racially-diverse sample of 210 TGW, the short version of the Stress-Related Growth Scale was modified to assess growth as a result of coming to terms with one’s transgender identity among TGW. The psychometric properties of the modified scale were examined, along with its associations with various cognitive, emotional, and social factors. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed a unidimensional factor, along with excellent reliability. A stepwise regression revealed that positive reappraisal, internal locus of control, social support, and emotional expression were associated with greater stress-related growth. Findings suggest that cognitive, emotional, and social resources are related to stress-related growth in TGW.

1584,Privileged professionalisms: Using co-cultural communication to strengthen inclusivity in professionalism education and community formation,"ABSTRACT Perpetuation of privileged norming in organizations threatens the fragile hope that the theory and practice of professionalism can evolve alongside commitments to equity and inclusion. Uncritical engagement with a normative professionalism can lead to the muting of differences and strengths that diverse standpoints offer to professional communities. We look to the field of Medicine as an example for other professional groups, in which experts have criticized its development of a normative professionalism shaped by, retaining, and sustaining privilege. Using a triad of case studies and co-cultural theory, we suggest that non-dominant perspectives and behaviors ought to be better recognized and welcomed as part of professionalism discourse, and that professional education ought to include co-cultural awareness of communication behaviors and their function as identity performance. We suggest that recognizing and reinforcing accommodation behaviors will lead to a more robust inclusivity for an evolving normativity, and that the wisdom habits of curiosity, perspective, love of learning, judgment, and creativity must be brought to bear on improving co-cultural dialogue, dismantling systemic privilege, practicing attributional complexity, and building genuinely dialogic professional communities rather than depersonalized collectives.",Ethics & behavior,2021.0,34,3,0,False,,,,"JF Tansey, ES Parks - Ethics & Behavior, 2022 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'ES Parks', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EqX9L-kAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=EqX9L-kAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'EqX9L-kAAAAJ'}]",1584,115062861,J.

1585,The Congregational Structure of Homonegativity: Why Place of Worship May Matter More than Frequency of Worship,"ABSTRACT Using 239 congregants from 14 randomly selected places of worship in the Southern United States—and a mega-analysis of 577 congregants from 34 similarly-located places of worship—we examined the relationship between religiousness and homonegativity. Multilevel models examining the effects of religiousness on homonegativity indicated that service attendance was more strongly related to homonegativity as a congregation-level variable than as an individual-level variable. Interaction effects between service attendance and the affirmativeness of a congregation were not significant, suggesting that the frequency of participation with a homonegative congregation is not related to homonegativity. These findings imply that the religiousness of a congregation is more closely related to homonegativity than the religiousness of an individual and that individuals may select a congregation that matches their views on same-sex sexuality. Homonegativity may serve a signaling function, enabling congregants to affiliate with a congregation with attitudes toward same-sex sexuality similar to their own.",Journal of Homosexuality,2021.0,82,2,0,False,The relationship between religiousness and homonegativity is examined to imply that the religiousness of a congregation is more closely related to hom onegativity than thereligiousness of an individual and that individuals may select a congregation that matches their views on same-sex sexuality.,,,"GT Lefevor, NA Tamez Guerrero, JY Paiz… - Journal of …, 2022 - Taylor & Francis","[{'name': 'GT Lefevor', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QOz182gAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=QOz182gAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'QOz182gAAAAJ'}]",1585,7831227,G.

1586,Enacted Stigma Experiences and Identity Noticeability of LGBQ+ Women with Rare Diseases.,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ+) people and those with rare diseases (RDs) experience considerable enacted stigma due to their sexual identity and disability/RD status. The frequency, severity, and type of enacted stigma is often influenced by identity noticeability. Although research has shown the challenging impacts of compounded oppression on multiply marginalized individuals, there has been no empirical research to date on the experiences of LGBQ+ women with RDs. This mixed methods study used survey and interview methods to explore enacted stigma experiences and identity noticeability of 29 LGBQ+ women with RDs. We found that RD visibility had a significant positive correlation to RD stigma. Additionally, age had a significant negative correlation to RD stigma and RD visibility.

1587,Daily Stressor Exposure and Daily Well-Being Among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Adults in the United States: Results from the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE).,"BACKGROUND
Daily stress plays a significant role in mental and physical health. Negative mood (e.g., hopelessness) and physical symptoms (e.g., headaches) are responses often associated with daily stressors. It is theorized that some people or populations are more vulnerable or reactive to daily stressors. We propose sexual orientation as one factor that is associated with daily stress exposure and reactivity.


PURPOSE
To understand whether sexual minorities (SMs) differ from heterosexuals in their exposure and reactivity to general, non-sexual minority-specific stressors (e.g., arguments/disagreements, job concerns).


METHODS
We used daily diary data (n = 3,323 heterosexuals [52% identified as female and 85% identified as White]; n = 98 SMs [50% identified as female and 93% identified as White]) from the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE). Participants completed eight consecutive evening daily diary interviews (n days = 24,773; mean days completed = 7.24) and reported daily stress exposure and daily well-being. We used multilevel modeling as an approach to examine whether sexual orientation interacted with daily stressors to predict daily negative affect and physical health.


RESULTS
SMs tended to experience more daily stressors compared to heterosexuals; specifically, SMs reported at least one stressor on nearly half (48%) of the study days they completed, and heterosexuals reported at least one stressor on about two-fifths (41%) of the study days they completed. SMs also tended to experience more negative mood when they experienced a daily stressor compared to heterosexuals when they experienced a daily stressor.


CONCLUSION
We emphasize the importance of SMs' exposure and reactivity to general daily stressors and the implications of our results for the day-to-day lives and health of SMs.",Annals of Behavioral Medicine,2021.0,72,4,0,False,The importance of SMs' exposure and reactivity to general daily stressors to predict daily negative affect and physical health is emphasized and the implications for the day-to-day lives and health ofSMs are emphasized.,,,,,1587,47126808,B.

1589,"Counter-Narratives of Structural Oppressions, Stigma and Resistance, and Reproductive and Sexual Health Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness","Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face myriad injustices regarding their reproductive and sexual health and rights. Reproductive and sexual health research with YEH often explores condom-use and sexually transmitted infections, potentially contributing to narrow conceptualizations of YEH as “unclean” or in need of disease-screening. A narrative theory perspective was applied to this study, which allowed for the emergence of alternative storylines, or counter-narratives, which attend to manifestations of power and oppression within the lives of marginalized individuals. Qualitative interviews engaged 30 young people (ages 18–21) accessing shelter services. Narrative analyses identified YEHs’ documentations of dominant narratives related to structural oppressions, stigma, and numerous dimensions of reproductive and sexual health including how they create, through their resistance, counter-narratives that include their preferred futures. YEH emphasized systemic sources of stigma and outlined their criticisms of the state. Within-group stigma emerged as a noteworthy theme, with YEH showing both empathy and ambivalence towards other YEH, along with internalization of stigmatizing narratives about pregnancy and homelessness. Approaches to service provision that further amplify youths’ voices in naming and challenging the many oppressions and stigmas they face should be prioritized. Moreover, policies should be implemented to dismantle the actual root causes of challenges faced by YEH, rather than perpetuating them through measures rooted in interlocking oppressions of discrimination, inequity, and judgment.",Qualitative Health Research,2022.0,82,1,0,False,,,,,,1589,2082884428,E.

1590,Systematic Review of Risk and Protective Factors for Revictimization After Child Sexual Abuse,"Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a widespread public health problem in the United States. It has been associated with multiple long-term deleterious outcomes including revictimization in adulthood. This systematic review of 25 studies synthesizes research examining possible risk and protective factors that might explain the established link between CSA and future victimizations. Specific risk factors identified included co-occurring maltreatment in the home, risky sexual behavior (particularly in adolescence), post-traumatic stress disorder, emotion dysregulation, and other maladaptive coping strategies. Only one protective factor was identified: perceived parental care. The review also revealed considerable variability in definitions and measurement of both CSA and adult victimization, particularly in terms of how researchers conceptualized age. Many of the studies were limited in generalizability by including only college-age women. These findings have clinical and research implications. Public health interventions working to prevent revictimization among CSA survivors can utilize these findings when designing programs. For researchers, the results highlight the need for standardized definitions of both CSA and revictimization, for well-validated and consistent measurement, and for inclusion of additional population groups in future research.","Trauma, Violence, & Abuse",2021.0,106,95,2,False,A systematic review of 25 studies synthesizes research examining possible risk and protective factors that might explain the established link between child sexual abuse and future victimizations and highlights the need for standardized definitions of both CSA and revictimization.,,,,,1590,8285009,Arielle A.

Our system specifically combines the dual-stage network which is a superior real-time speech enhancement framework with the ECAPA-TDNN speaker embedding network which achieves state-of-the-art performance in speaker verification. The dual-stage network aims to decouple the primal speech enhancement problem into multiple easier sub-problems. Specifically, in stage 1, only the magnitude of the target speech is estimated, which is incorporated with the noisy phase to obtain a coarse complex spectrum estimation. To facilitate the formal estimation, in stage 2, an auxiliary network serves as a post-processing module, where residual noise and interfering speech are further suppressed and the phase information is effectively modified. With the asymmetric loss function to penalize over-suppression, more target speech is preserved, which is helpful for both speech recognition performance and subjective sense of hearing. Our system reaches 3.97 in overall audio quality (OVRL) MOS and 0.69 in word accuracy (WAcc) on the blind test set of the challenge, which outperforms the DNS baseline by 0.57 OVRL and ranks 1st in track 2.","IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing",2022.0,0,14,0,False,"This paper describes Tencent Ethereal Audio Lab – Northwestern Polytechnical University personalized speech enhancement system submitted to track 2 of the ICASSP 2022 Deep Noise Suppression challenge, which outperforms the DNS baseline by 0.57 OVRL and ranks 1st in track 2.",,,,,1592,2167029478,Yukai Ju,46519385,Wei Rao,2117852841,Xiaopeng Yan,46956354,Yihui Fu,1850537915,Shubo Lv,97775404,Luyao Cheng,Computer Science,"JournalArticle, Conference"
1593,Cross-cultural adaptation of four instruments to measure stigma towards people with mental illness and substance use problems among primary care professionals in Chile.,"Stigma toward people with mental illness and substance use problems is a significant global concern, and prevents people with these conditions from accessing treatment, particularly in primary health care (PHC) settings. Stigma is a cultural phenomenon that is influenced by particular contexts and can differ by country and region. The majority of stigma research focuses on Europe or North America leading to a lack of culturally relevant stigma research instruments for the Latin American context. The present study describes and discusses the methodology for cross-culturally adapting four stigma measurement scales to the Chilean context. The cross-cultural adaptation process included nine phases: (1) preparation; (2) independent translations; (3) synthesis 1 with expert committee; (4) focus groups and interviews with researchers, PHC professionals, and PHC users; (5) synthesis 2 with expert committee; (6) independent back translations; (7) synthesis 3 with expert committee; (8) pilot with PHC professionals; and (9) final revisions. The adaptation process included an array of diverse voices from the PHC context, and met three adaptation objectives defined prior to beginning the process (Understandability, Relevance, and Acceptability and Answer Options). The resulting, culturally adapted questionnaire is being validated and implemented within PHC settings across Chile to provide in-depth insight into stigma among PHC professionals in the country.

1595,Using an Intersectional Lens on Vulnerability and Resilience in Minority and/or Marginalized Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review,"Throughout the pandemic, the media and scholars have widely discussed increasing social inequality and thereby publicly pointed to often hidden and neglected forms of inequality. However, the “newly” arisen awareness has not yet been put into action to reduce this inequality. Dealing with social inequality implies exploring and confronting social privileges, which are often seen as the other side of inequality. These social constructs, inequality and privilege, are often discussed in light of vulnerability and resilience. This is particularly important in the context of the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to end the pandemic, as both constructs are discussed regarding access to healthcare, vaccination, and education and knowledge, misinformation, social resources, economic resources, and so forth. Minority and/or marginalized groups may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, resilience factors in these groups may be neglected and underreported. This narrative review aims at illustrating the specific and intertwined aspects of resilience and vulnerability in minority and/or marginalized groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, we use an intersectional lens based on recommendations made by Moradi and Grzanka. A total of 48 articles were included in the narrative review. Most of them were commentaries focusing on social inequality, vulnerability, and/or resilience. Based on the dissection of articles at structural, systemic, and individual levels, we propose three hypothesis on vulnerability and resilience in minority and marginalized individuals and groups: (1) social inequality must be considered at a global level; inequality at a global level translates into a vulnerable context for an individual; (2) vulnerability is historically situated: vulnerability (experienced during the pandemic) is maintained and reinforced by history; (3) strength through collective (historical) hardship: vulnerability is not the opposite of resilience but may serve as an aspect of resilience. The conclusions drawn from this review show that we need to include diverse voices to advance concepts, such as vulnerability and resilience, in minority and marginalized groups. Additionally, these concepts are not necessarily in opposition to each other, but vulnerability should be understood as an integral part of resilience.",Frontiers in Psychology,2022.0,133,0,0,True,,Html,"[{'title': 'nih.gov', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9158486/'}]","H Siller, N Aydin - Frontiers in Psychology, 2022 - ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","[{'name': 'H Siller', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LwIb2qkAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=LwIb2qkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'LwIb2qkAAAAJ'}, {'name': 'N Aydin', 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zrV5IEQAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra', 'serpapi_scholar_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=zrV5IEQAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en', 'author_id': 'zrV5IEQAAAAJ'}]",1595,13577017,Heidi Siller,39134972,Nilüfer Aydin,,,,,,,,,Medicine,"Review, JournalArticle"

1597,Housing conditions and non-communicable diseases among older adults in Ireland,"
Purpose
Housing quality across the life course is an important health determinant. The purpose of this paper is to profile the current housing conditions of older adults in Ireland, and to investigate the association between housing conditions and heating problems and two types of non-communicable diseases: respiratory health problems and bone and joint conditions.


Design/methodology/approach
Data are from the Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative Age-friendly Cities and Counties Survey, a random-sample, population representative survey of 10,540 adults aged 55 and older collected in 2015–2016. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between poor housing (leaks, rot and damp) and poor heating (unable to keep the home adequately warm) and the likelihood of having a respiratory health problem or a bone or joint condition. Results are reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.


Findings
Overall, 10.2 per cent had poor housing and 10.4 per cent had poor heating. Poor housing and poor heating were strongly associated with respiratory health problems and there was a strong association between poor housing and bone and joint conditions. These associations were not explained by health behaviours or socio-demographic characteristics.


Originality/value
Despite a number of publicly funded schemes available to assist in upgrading and maintaining housing, a considerable number of adults aged 55 years and older continue to report problems which are associated with an increased likelihood of respiratory health problem and bone and joint conditions and present a considerable threat to healthy ageing in place.

Each was a contest of ideologically ambitious, institutionally immiscible, and territorially extensionist socioeconomic systems. Each rivalry evolved a mechanism for the procrastination of conflict. In both cases this mechanism was initially deliberative—based on debate. It remained deliberative in the North-South case, which deteriorated from cooperation to catastrophe, but it switched from deliberative to confrontational—based on threat—in the East-West case, which ended in voluntary unilateral abandonment of ideology, institutions, and territory. The irony of the outcomes of these two rivalries, whose likelihoods of violent end would probably have been misranked at their respective midpoints, is discussed.",Review of International Studies,1999.0,11,4,0,False,,,,,,1598,4023112,R.

1599,Increasing Critical Care Nurse Engagement of Palliative Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"BACKGROUND
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to escalating infection rates and associated deaths worldwide. Amid this public health emergency, the urgent need for palliative care integration throughout critical care settings has never been more crucial.


OBJECTIVE
To promote palliative care engagement in critical care; share palliative care resources to support critical care nurses in alleviating suffering during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and make recommendations to strengthen nursing capacity to deliver high-quality, person-centered critical care. Methods Palliative and critical care literature and practice guidelines were reviewed, synthesized, and translated into recommendations for critical care nursing practice.


RESULTS
Nurses are ideally positioned to drive full integration of palliative care into the critical care delivery for all patients, including those with coronavirus disease 2019, given their relationship-based approach to care, as well as their leadership and advocacy roles. Recommendations include the promotion of healthy work environments and prioritizing nurse self-care in alignment with critical care nursing standards.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurses should focus on a strategic integration of palliative care, critical care, and ethically based care during times of normalcy and of crisis.

1600,HIV-1 Drug Susceptibility to Potential Second- and Third-Line Antiretroviral Regimens among Cameroonian Patients: Evidence from a Crosssectional Design,"Background: Scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the growing number of longtermtreated patients may favor multi-HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in resource-limited settings. Understandingthe burden of HIVDR with ART-exposure may provide new insights for an effectivelong-term management of infected patients.Methods: Sixty-six HIV-infected individuals (18 ART-naive, 24 failing first-line, 24 failing secondlineART) living in Yaounde-Cameroon were evaluated by sequencing protease-reverse transcriptase(PR-RT, n=62), envelope-V3 loop (V3, n=58) and integrase (IN, n=30) regions. Drug resistance mutations(DRMs) were interpreted using Stanford University HIV drug resistance database andgeno2pheno, while viral tropism prediction was done using geno2pheno, position-specific scoring matrices(PSSM) and Net charge rule.Results: Participants, from naive, first- to second-line, had respectively 5.30, 4.85 and 4.66 log HIVRNA, and 532, 203 and 146 CD4 cells/mm 3 ), and infected with diverse HIV-1 non-B clades (58.1%CRF02_AG). Among ART-naive patients, 6.7% harbored K103N, 28.6% had IN accessory-mutations(L74I, E157Q) and 26.7% carried CXCR4-tropic viruses. At first-line failure, 79.2% harbored DRMsto nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors, 33.3% had IN accessory-mutations (L68I, L74I,T97A, E157Q), and 47.4% carried CXCR4-tropic viruses. At second-line failure, 91.3% harboredmulti-DRMs to PR-RT inhibitors (with 52.2% and 4.3% DRMs to second-generation NNRTIs and darunavir/r, respectively), 27.3% had IN accessory-mutations (L74I, T97A, E157EQ), and 37.5% carriedCXCR4-tropic viruses.Conclusion: Levels of PR-RT resistance increases with ART-exposure, with needs for new ART-optionsfollowing second-line failure.

1601,Computer Aided Diagnosis of Melanoma Using Deep Neural Networks and Game Theory: Application on Dermoscopic Images of Skin Lesions,"Early detection of melanoma remains a daily challenge due to the increasing number of cases and the lack of dermatologists. Thus, AI-assisted diagnosis is considered as a possible solution for this issue. Despite the great advances brought by deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are still not used in clinical practice. This may be explained by the dermatologist’s fear of being misled by a false negative and the assimilation of CNNs to a “black box”, making their decision process difficult to understand by a non-expert. Decision theory, especially game theory, is a potential solution as it focuses on identifying the best decision option that maximizes the decision-maker’s expected utility. This study presents a new framework for automated melanoma diagnosis. Pursuing the goal of improving the performance of existing systems, our approach also attempts to bring more transparency in the decision process. The proposed framework includes a multi-class CNN and six binary CNNs assimilated to players. The players’ strategies is to first cluster the pigmented lesions (melanoma, nevus, and benign keratosis), using the introduced method of evaluating the confidence of the predictions, into confidence level (confident, medium, uncertain). Then, a subset of players has the strategy to refine the diagnosis for difficult lesions with medium and uncertain prediction. We used EfficientNetB5 as the backbone of our networks and evaluated our approach on the public ISIC dataset consisting of 8917 lesions: melanoma (1113), nevi (6705) and benign keratosis (1099). The proposed framework achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.93 for melanoma, 0.96 for nevus and 0.97 for benign keratosis. Furthermore, our approach outperformed existing methods in this task, improving the balanced accuracy (BACC) of the best compared method from 77% to 86%. These results suggest that our framework provides an effective and explainable decision-making strategy. This approach could help dermatologists in their clinical practice for patients with atypical and difficult-to-diagnose pigmented lesions. We also believe that our system could serve as a didactic tool for less experienced dermatologists.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2022.0,60,0,0,True,"A new framework for automated melanoma diagnosis is presented, which outperformed existing methods in this task and could help dermatologists in their clinical practice for patients with atypical and difficult-to-diagnose pigmented lesions.",,,,,1601,2125926499,A.C.

1602,Transgender Identity Is Associated With Bullying Involvement Among Finnish Adolescents,"Background During adolescence, bullying often has a sexual content. Involvement in bullying as a bully, victim or both has been associated with a range of negative health outcomes. Transgender youth appear to face elevated rates of bullying in comparison to their mainstream peers. However, the involvement of transgender youth as perpetrators of bullying remains unclear in the recent literature. Objective The aim of this study was to compare involvement in bullying between transgender and mainstream youth and among middle and late adolescents in a general population sample. Methods Our study included 139,829 students in total, divided between a comprehensive school and an upper secondary education sample. Associations between gender identity and involvement in bullying were first studied using cross-tabulations with chi-square statistics. Logistic regression was used to study multivariate associations. Gender identity was used as the independent variable, with cisgender as the reference category. Subjection to and perpetration of bullying were entered each in turn as the dependent variable. Demographic factors, family characteristics, internalizing symptoms, externalizing behaviors, and involvement in bullying in the other role were added as confounding factors. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are given. The limit for statistical significance was set at p < 0.001. Results Both experiences of being bullied and perpetrating bullying were more commonly reported by transgender youth than by cisgender youth. Among transgender youth, all involvement in bullying was more commonly reported by non-binary youth than those identifying with the opposite sex. Logistic regression revealed that non-binary identity was most strongly associated with involvement in bullying, followed by opposite sex identity and cisgender identity. Transgender identities were also more strongly associated with perpetration of bullying than subjection to bullying. Conclusion Transgender identity, especially non-binary identity, is associated with both being bullied and perpetrating bullying even when a range of variables including internal stress and involvement in bullying in the opposite role are taken into account. This suggests that bullying during adolescence may serve as a mechanism of maintaining heteronormativity.",Frontiers in Psychology,2021.0,73,14,1,True,"Transgender identity, especially non-binary identity, is associated with both being bullied and perpetrating bullying even when a range of variables including internal stress and involvement in bullying in the opposite role are taken into account, which suggests that bullying during adolescence may serve as a mechanism of maintaining heteronormativity.",,,,,1602,1430737946,Elias Heino,7976125,Noora Ellonen,115090263,R.

1603,On the practical teaching of Business German translation based on Skopos Theory,"In theory, skopos theory belongs to functional translation theory, and translation must pay attention to skopos, so its translation strategies and methods should be changed with the purpose of the original text. Under this condition, Business German, as a compulsory course for German majors in universities, its business nature makes students not only master literal translation skills, but also ensure whether the translated text information is consistent with the original purpose. Therefore, the introduction of Skopos Theory in the teaching of this course is very important. This paper will analyze the current situation of Business German and explain the importance of the combination of Business German and teleology. Introduction According to previous studies, Skopos Theory sublimates traditional literal translation into target translation, that is, in traditional literal translation, the translator's knowledge simply transforms the literal consciousness of the two languages, and guarantees the smoothness. However, under the condition of Business German, literal translation may lead to the word's failure to reach the meaning and produce the desired effect, so this problem can be avoided under the role of Skopos theory, To ensure that translation still has the function of achieving business purpose. Accordingly, under the influence of Skopos theory, all the translator's behaviors and languages concerning translation must be guided by the purpose of translation. If they are separated, the above phenomena will occur [1]. Under this condition, in the process of Business German teaching, in addition to helping students understand the German language system, we should also strengthen students' understanding of Chinese, focusing on the education of German interpretation in Chinese. The quality of this teaching process is an indicator that directly affects students' learning quality of Business German. Therefore, Business German teaching objectives must be taken into account in Business German teaching According to these factors, the teaching methods and methods are decided, and the teaching is systematic and purposeful. From this point of view, this research will explore the ideas and methods of practical teaching of Business German from the perspective of Skopos theory, aiming to improve the modern students' cognition of Business German and enhance their knowledge application ability and translation skills in German translation. Basic concept of teleology The basic concept of Skopos theory consists of three principles, namely, the principle of translation purpose, the principle of sentence fluency and the principle of faithfulness. Among them, the principle of translation purpose is the most intuitive system of Skopos theory, which means that the translation behavior must achieve the translation purpose; the principle of sentence fluency is second only to the principle of purpose, which means that the translated text must be smooth and fluent; the principle of faithfulness is the principle of clarifying the primary and secondary relationship between the translator and the translation goal, which means that the final translation of the translator must be dominated by the original [2]. Figure 1 priority of three principles of teleology. 2019 3rd International Conference on Advancement of the Theory and Practices in Education (ICATPE 2019) Copyright © (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/icatpe.2019.299 1482 Figure 1 priority of three principles of teleology (top-down) Common problems in Business German translation teaching 2.1 low effectiveness of translation teaching At present, the German translation courses in many colleges and universities are not perfect, and the overall frequency is low, and the class hours are few. The main reasons for this phenomenon are as follows: 1 modern colleges and universities will carry out many practical teaching activities, such as competition, project teaching, and so on, influenced by the overall development policy of ""morality, intelligence, sports, labor and beauty"", which will inevitably affect the whole education class hours The corresponding German translation courses will also be affected by the invitation for war, and the above problems will arise accordingly; 2 according to the practice teaching activities in common cases, it can be seen that the activities must occupy a certain class hour, and in most cases, the courses occupied include the German translation courses, which is a typical phenomenon of educational concept deviation. To sum up, the specialized course of German translation in modern colleges and universities is not perfect, and the corresponding students have a big fault in learning the professional skills of German translation. This fault is easy for students to forget what they have learned, at the same time, it has a subtle impact on students' cognition, making students think that ""learning the specialized course of German translation"" is not important, and finally they may even give up German learning, which leads to The phenomenon of low effectiveness of translation teaching [3]. 2.2 single teaching mode of Business German translation course in Colleges and Universities Although German is a foreign language, it has been integrated into the traditional education in China's higher education. That is to say, the teaching mode of Business German in most modern colleges and universities is the same as that of ""Chinese"", ""Mathematics"" and other subjects, which shows that the teaching mode of Business German translation course in Colleges and universities is single. Under this condition, because of the obvious defect of the traditional teaching mode, that is, the classroom is dominated by the teacher, and the teacher unilaterally transmits the knowledge to the students, while the students only need to passively memorize the contents of the teacher's statements. Correspondingly, influenced by human nature, the students are prone to negative emotions and even negative psychology in the long-term passive position, which leads to the students' teaching of Business German They are unwilling to contact with the teaching content. The optimization strategy of practical teaching of Business German translation under Skopos Theory 3.1 Practical Business German translation teaching principles and methods Under the influence of Skopos theory, in Business German translation teaching, teachers should consider the individual needs of different students, and make teaching plans according to students' learning ability (understanding ability, basic knowledge level, etc.), for example, when students'",,2020.0,6,0,0,False,,,,,,1603,152202767,Wang Wen-jun,,,,,,,,,,,Sociology,
1604,Weaving Privacy and Power: On the Privacy Practices of Labor Organizers in the U.S. Technology Industry,"We investigate the privacy practices of labor organizers in the computing technology industry and explore the changes in these practices as a response to remote work. Our study is situated at the intersection of two pivotal shifts in workplace dynamics: (a) the increase in online workplace communications due to remote work, and (b) the resurgence of the labor movement and an increase in collective action in workplaces— especially in the tech industry, where this phenomenon has been dubbed the tech worker movement. The shift of work-related communications to online digital platforms in response to an increase in remote work is creating new opportunities for and risks to the privacy of workers. These risks are especially significant for organizers of collective action, with several well-publicized instances of retaliation against labor organizers by companies. Through a series of qualitative interviews with 29 tech workers involved in collective action, we investigate how labor organizers assess and mitigate risks to privacy while engaging in these actions. Among the most common risks that organizers experienced are retaliation from their employer, lateral worker conflict, emotional burnout, and the possibility of information about the collective effort leaking to management. Depending on the nature and source of the risk, organizers use a blend of digital security practices and community-based mechanisms. We find that digital security practices are more relevant when the threat comes from management, while community management and moderation are central to protecting organizers from lateral worker conflict. Since labor organizing is a collective rather than individual project, individual privacy and collective privacy are intertwined, sometimes in conflict and often mutually constitutive. Notions of privacy that solely center individuals are often incompatible with the needs of organizers, who noted that safety in numbers could only be achieved when workers presented a united front to management. Based on our interviews, we identify key topics for future research, such as the growing prevalence of surveillance software and the needs of international and gig worker organizers. We conclude with design recommendations that can help create safer, more secure and more private tools to better address the risks that organizers face.",ArXiv,2022.0,71,0,0,False,"This study investigates the privacy practices of labor organizers in the computing technology industry and explores the changes in these practices as a response to remote work, and identifies key topics for future research, such as the growing prevalence of surveillance software and the needs of international and gig worker organizers.",,,,,1604,39893263,Sayash Kapoor,2115617198,Matthew Sun,2109019113,Mona Wang,2143255340,Klaudia Ja'zwi'nska,29830026,E.
